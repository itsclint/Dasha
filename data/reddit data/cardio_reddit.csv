9,Measuring caloric expenditure in patients with high resting heart rate,"Exercise science student and paramedic here. I was wondering if there are recommendations on measuring caloric expenditure when patients have high resting heart rates?        

I will admit I have a high resting HR (100-120) and easily hit 160+ with minimal effort. However, in my degree program we talk about measuring caloric expenditure based on heart rate. No one is able to give a solid answer on how to measure expenditure without heart rate.       

I know I'm not the only person with this, so I don't feel like I'm asking for medical advice. Is expenditure more accurate when heart rate is controlled with CCBs or beta blockers?"

16,Tools to work with SCP-ECG or ESK files?,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I have a small holter Healforce PC-80B. I changed it yesterday as I thought there started to be too much noise (I had bought two), but I messed up the date configuration : shortly after midnight, I entered ""October 26th"", so now I have one night of data which has the wrong date.

&#x200B;

I don't want to mess up my data by having two ""nights of the 26th"" but I also don't want to delete it. So I was wondering if you knew of any softwares/tools that could allow me to change the date on those SCP-ECG files? (command line tools would be great as the holter creates thousands of 30 seconds SCP-ECG files, then the Healforce software combines them in what appears to be a proprietary format, so command line would make automation easier)

&#x200B;

The software can backup the ""merged"" files as ESK files, so I suppose I could add the wrong files, back them up, modify the backups before re-importing them. Anyone knows tools/softwares for ESK?

&#x200B;

Also if you know any tools that can merge thousands of SCP-ECG files into one big file, I would be very interested to hear about it."

I'm not looking at a detailed view of how an ECG is performed, but more of a big-picture view. Basically, I want to understand the order of events from when a patient enters the facility to diagnosis, expecially as it relates to each user type (persona) and department.

Right now I have a very basic understanding of the process. Order/Encounter (admin) -> Exam (tech) -> Reading (doctor) -> Report (doctor). 

I know I may be asking a lot of you, but it would be amazing if you can point me to further reading or other types of resources like video. I have tried searching for myself, but I can't seem to get the search right in Google because the results are only tangentially related to what I'm trying to find. Also, please let me know if there's a more appropriate forum in which to ask these questions.

How does the doctor view the exam? Is it on the cart itself, or is there a PACS in place? Or both? 

What happens if the PACS is down? Does the doctor go to the cart? Does the doctor read on an electronic screen, or do they prefer paper?

Where does the process break? Why?

What departments use ECG currently? I currently have ED, Cardiovascular medicine, electrophysiology labs, heart rhythm clinic, pediatric cardiology, sports medicine. Are there others?"

Dual antiplatelet therapy has shown to be beneficial without a doubt in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Recent trials have shown that second and third generation ADP inhibitors are safer and more effective than first generation ones, but when compared (Prasugrel vs Ticagrelor in the ISAR-REACT 5), Ticagrelor was inferior to Prasugrel even with the theoretical benefit it has (no first pass metabolism, reversible platelet inhibition, etc).

58,Increasing diagnosis of rare anatomical variants due to prenatal ultrasounds?,"I'm not a medical professional, also in no way seeking medical advice, but I have an anecdote to share to explain why I'm interested in this topic. When I was pregnant with my daughter a few years ago, her routine 20 week anatomy ultrasound showed that she has a right sided aortic arch. Several fetal echos later, it was determined that she does not have a vascular ring or any other issues and the cardiologist said this will likely not affect her life in any meaningful way. As such, her RSAA is more of a variation than a defect or a deformity.

Ever since then, I've been really curious about whether this condition and other similar variations may be more common than we know, and whether the diagnosis of such is on the rise now that ultrasound technology is getting so good and prenatal ultrasound is becoming so common.

Have the pediatric cardiologists around here noticed that they are finding more benign variations these days?

I'm a 29yo male.

I have done occasional EKGs and echos because I'm slightly hypertensive. They all come back normal as per my primary. I've also seen a cardiologist about a year ago who did a halter for 24 hours and an echo of the heart and basically told me the same thing. Just saying that so there are no misconceptions that I'm looking for medical advice. Just for my own curiosity. And I have asked this of my primary as well as my cardiologists but they just told me that it's not something I should worry about.

Basically what I'd like to know what parameters does the machine use to generate the codes that it generate for me. I'm including a picture of a cardoogram I did in March of this year as well as the one that was done today. It's a bit hard to see the print so I'll list them here:

Possible left left atrial abnormality
Sinus rhythm
rSr(V1) - probable normal variant

I would like to know what parts of my ekg are responsible for the machine to form that analysis.

When I asked that of my doctor she told me that it could be because of a misplaced lead or that I moved a bit. But since it's on 2 consecutive ekgs I'd like to know what the machine is seeing that the doctors aren't. Thanks.

These are the two reports, one from March, one from today.

Of course the rep was pushing for it to be used to given to reduce cardiovascular events, but of course I take everything they say with a grain of salt. I wonder if you would get the same benefits with OTC omega-3/fish oil? Of course there was not an arm in this study that used fish oil.

My question is would you give this to patients with CAD who were currently optimized on guideline directed therapy even without elevated triglycerides, with the only goal of reducing CV events?

98,Bradycardic afib s/p CABG. How would you pace with the temporary pacemaker?,"Coming from a CVICU RN:

We had a POD#0 CABG on my floor recently go into a bradycardic afib in the 40s with very poor BP, MAP in the 40s-50s. CI&gt;2 actually, but low CTO (&lt;60cc in 6 hours, which is pretty low even for this surgeon who is already fairly clean with her grafts). The RN tried to pace this patient in AAI, to no avail, and brushed other pacing modes off when recommended by other RNs on the floor. Pacer basically failing to capture those atrial spikes. Epi, vaso, levo, and multiple albumins were given PRN. My first thoughts were (1) the pacing was not handled correctly, and (2) the patient was possibly tamponading and the RN should have got a stat CXR, followed by pushing CVTS/anesthesia for a stat echo or possibly bedside TEE. Though, maybe we would know better if the patient was sufficiently paced and could observe hemodynamics after the appropriate change.

I was told that anesthesia didn‚Äôt seem concerned apparently, which I find extremely strange. No pulsus paradoxus, but still basically a very bad scenario. I don‚Äôt have details on other hemodynamic values, as I wasn‚Äôt there.

Anyway, aside from what sounds like a train wreck of decisions and communication, it also bothered me a lot that this nurse tried to pace this patient AAI.

For me, I‚Äôd try VVI and see how the patient tolerates at various rates. DDD wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice. Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if the PM would capture with all the noise from fibrillation, and I‚Äôd be wary of the pacer pacing the ventricles unpredictably if the mA from the atrial fibrillation waves are &gt; the sensitivity setting.

How would you go about pacing this patient? I would think VVI would be the most ideal with an underlying afib, but is DDD ever appropriate with that rhythm?"

I was also wondering, upon auscultation, where is a PVC heard? I assume it is right after s2? When the ventricle contracts before the atria does? And then there is the pause, and the next beat is stronger because the atria have filled with more blood than normal d/t not contracting at their normal time?

127,Virtues of ED Stress Testing,"Hi all, 

I'm a student trying to make my way in this big Evidence Based world and read a lot of emergency medicine literature, blogs, etc. First10EM recently posted this [series on ED Stress testing](https://first10em.com/stress-test-evidence-intro/) which seemingly makes a case against routinely stress testing low risk chest pain patients. He's a well regarded 'EBM nerd' in emergency medicine and I've learned a lot from his other work. He also makes reference to an ACEP [recommendation](https://www.acep.org/patient-care/clinical-policies/nonst-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/) against routine stress testing following negative EKG/troponins in the ED. However, plenty of well regarded institutions have dedicated cardiac observation units for stress testing low risk patients, and I am guessing there's another side to this coin. 

Just curious to hear thoughtful responses from the Cardiology world if anyone is willing to spend the time. Which points (if any) do you agree with? Where do you find flaws in his arguments?

144,Aspirin,"I recently had to have heart bypass surgery because of a mistake made during a heart catheterization. The doctor cut the artery during the catheter. This is what lead to the bypass.

I wanted them to do a CTA instead, but they talked me into the catheter. No blockages were found during the catheter. Nothing was wrong, but do to the mistake, I needed emergency bypass surgery to fix the mistake. Now, after surgery (4 weeks later), I‚Äôm on blood pressure meds, Plavix, and aspirin. I‚Äôm slowly tapering off the blood pressure meds because my blood pressure has been dipping below 90/60 on most days. My resting heart rate is at 53 bpm on most days.

Keep in mind that I‚Äôm not the typical heart patient. I never had heart disease. I don‚Äôt want to be on these meds for the rest of my life. I also read that aspirin can have a rebound effect which can cause a clot if you stop it suddenly. My arteries are not narrowed, so I‚Äôm not sure if I would experience the rebound effect. I know that clots can form after surgery while healing. How long does it take to heal? How long after taking aspirin every day does it take to experience the rebound effect after stopping it?

If you have specific questions, I am happy to answer any and all and provide as much detail as possible.

History: Diagnosed at birth with WPW. First ablation 07/1999, one pathway. It was the most common WPW pathway which I believe is left lateral (?). If there is interest in the details from my childhood ablation, I could dig up the details in a couple weeks. I will note that my EP cardiologist felt there was a second pathway but could not find it. 

It‚Äôs unclear when I started experiencing symptoms again. I have an autoimmune disease and had been experiencing issues several symptoms alongside extreme fatigue since 2014. (Not going to give all the boring details here.) 

I started getting chest pains in December 2018 and becoming incredibly symptomatic. I am in great physical shape (5‚Äô3‚Äù/140/capable of 9 pull ups/7 minute mile) and was getting out of breath unloading the dishwasher. My PAC burden was 5%. I did not tolerate propafenone. I had a horrific experience with it. 

Now for the technical details:

Ablation date - March 13, 2019

EP study performed from the coronary sinus, left ventricle, right atrium, His bundle and right ventricle. 

Right ventricle pacing produced a concentric pattern of retrograde activation. ParaHisian pacing was performed at 10 mA (His capture) and 3 mA (RV muscle capture) and we obtained a nodal response of retrograde conduction with paraHisian pacing in sinus rhythm. We did not indenting an AH jump with atrial extrastimulus tearing. We were able to obtain atrial AV nodal echo beats after critical prolongation of the AH interval at the Wenckebach cycle length. We were able to induce consistent mononorphic PACs with proximal coronary sinus pacing at 600 am. Atrial burst pacing and extrastimulus testing was performed on and off of isoproterebol infusion up to 4 mcg/min with increase of HR to 150‚Äôs from baseline 70‚Äôs. With burst pacing and programmed stimulation we were unable to induce a sustained tachyarrhythmia. 

We then proceeded with activation mapping of the PACs.

The PACs occurred spontaneously with burst pacing from the proximal coronary sinus. With mapping of the right atrium, the earliest site of activation was paraHisian with a His bundle potential obtains at the earliest site. The bipolar electrogram was -46 ms to the reference proximal coronary sinus electrogram. The unipolar electrogram was a QS complex. 

We then decided to perform left atrial mapping. 

Activation mapping of the left atrium indenturing the earliest site of atrial activation to be opposite the earliest site of activation at the right atrial paraHisian location. The earliest left atrial activation site was -36 ms pre reference electrogram. The unipolar electrogram was an rS complex. Ablation at this site eliminated the spontaneously occurring PACs. 

We performed ablation at 50 Watts with a temperature limit of 55 degrees C with ablation up for 60 seconds. We delivered a total of 5 lesions. There was no evidence of AH prolongation, junctional beats or dropped beats during the ablation. Following ablation the AH and HV intervals remained stable. 

Patient will be admitted to PTU and monitored for possible CNS complications, arrhythmias, pericardial effusion and tamponade, groin hematoma or bleeding. 

I have the specific measurements and refractory periods if anyone is curious about those, I can share too. 

I should note that this was performed using general anesthesia as at the beginning of the procedure I was sitting up and moving my extremities despite being under deep sedation with propafol. 

After my procedure, my cardiologist informed me that he didn‚Äôt know how long my ablation would last. It could be a couple hours, days, weeks, months, he wasn‚Äôt sure. He told me that I may need another ablation or eventually need a pacemaker. 

I was discharged the following morning with cholchicine and aspirin for the next 30 days. My 6 week post-op monitor showed a burden of <1%. 

I had a couple good months, despite being diagnosed with IC (see my post history). Recently I‚Äôve been having issues again, specifically reduced exercise tolerance. It‚Äôs not nearly as bad as it was before the procedure. My fatigue and constant napping is also back. It‚Äôs not interfering with my life the way it was before the ablation so I‚Äôm going to continue on and hope things don‚Äôt get worse. My cardiologist knows and will order me a monitor at my discretion. 

I‚Äôm a mobile user so sorry for any typos or weird formatting etc.  

Later this summer I can dig up the details from childhood and the WPW ablation if there‚Äôs interest."

150,Can elevated ANG2 be a response to poor ADH expression?,"# Background

This past 2 years it has been learning more about the medical field and the human body as I am a research junky and love to learn and love to help people. I have enjoyed learning about the human body so much that I am at the point where I have considered applying to a nursing program. 

First year I focused on all the aspects of basic health and wellness and the past 9 months have been studying various subspecialties. 

Currently, I have studied for over 500 hours and read over 1500 NIH pubmed articles, endotext books, and medical journal articles.

The past 3 months I have been learning about endocrinology and cardiology.

# Why

I am constantly learning and every 6 months to 2 years take time to study and do a deep dive on complex topics. 

A few of my past deep dives on topics have included: 

automobiles (1.5 years), cloud computing infrastructure design (1.25 years), web design with a focus on UX (2 years), religion (2 years), programming in python (9 months), forensic level data recovery and general data protection (6 months), and before that a short deep dive into business law (2 months). 

# Questions

* Can elevated ANG2 (between 80-100ng/dL) be due to a response to poor ADH (vasopressin) expression (1-2 pg/mL) in an adult with borderline hypotension, elevated serum osmolality ( >300  mOsm/kg), and a reduced thirst response? 
   * Could elevated ANG2 be due to hypotension or is it due to insufficient ADH release or both?
   * If it is due to insufficient ADH release, could it be that the body is trying to force ADH expression through constant ANG2 upregulation?
* Could decreased ADH expression response be due to pituitary damage?
* Could decreased ADH expression be due to over expression of ANG2?
* Could decreased ADH expression also indicated decreased oxytocin expression?
* Can the reduced natural thirst response be due to decreased vasopressin release?
* Can the current level of vasopressin release be caused due to the SIADH action of SSRIs?
* Can salt avoidance be a physiological response due to consistently elevated Serum Osmolality?
* If none of the statements above can be true, then what can cause elevated ANG2 without elevating blood pressure?"

Although I have also read that up regulation of beta receptors occurs but due to the action of Beta Blockers as an Antagonist this is not in issue??. In any case the lack of tolerance building to beta blockers is evidenced by many patients effectively using the same dose for hypertension for years, even decades?

I also apologize if this isn‚Äôt appropriate for this sub, but I‚Äôm not sure where else to look.

So in this case 911 was called after the patient wandered from the space they were subletting into another tenants apartment before sitting down and slumping over.  

Law enforcement reports his room has a large collection of unidentified whit powders and rocks, as well as ‚Äúa bunch of meds‚Äù though they were only able to secure a bag of humalog.

On arrival pt is being held in a seated position by law enforcement, respiration‚Äôs are 16, lungs clear and equal, pupils dilated and reactive, spo2 88%, HR 40 and weak radially, pressure 108/50, BGL hi (650+).  

Narcan was administered, 2 mg IM, seemingly without effect.  After patient is extracted from the house and IV access is established atropine is administered at 0.5 MG IV.  About seventy seconds later pt heart rate increases into the 170‚Äôs.  After about two minuets the rate equilibrated in the 110‚Äôs.  12‚Äôs before and after atropine included in the link below.  This increase in heart rate coincided with a increase in respiratory rate 38, and a two point increase in GCS, now localizing pain and making inappropriate sounds.

The only other information I got after turning over care is that the patient had a Ph of 6.8 and their bicarb was ‚Äúbottomed out‚Äù.

Based on my understanding of the pharmacodynamics of atropine I cant comprehend the patients physiological response.  I understand the change in mentation and respiration may be due to delayed response to narcan based on the acidic environment.  I‚Äôm having trouble wrapping my head around the cardiac response though.

I am curious how you, as cardiologists, approach the issue of cardiophobia? For example, I had an episode back in December where I thought I was having a heart attack. Turns out, was just a panic attack (which I had never had in my life up until that point). Since then I have had extensive testing done; a stress test (with abnormal ST depressions leading to more testing), 2 echocardiograms (no abnormalities), two event monitors worn for 15 and 30 days (no abnormal arrythmias detected), and a CT coronary (zero signs of calcification). By all rights I have a perfectly normal, healthy heart for a 33 year old. Yet, due to the triggering event, it is hard for me to do things that I think would trigger ... something heart related that may kill me. I am sure this feeling is like 1000x more exacerbated for people who actually have heart issues. So I am curious what ya'll do when your patients run into that, who develop anxiety around their heart."

It's was very helpful in understanding the leads and placements and the reasoning behind it all and I think at this point I know more than enough for I what I will be tested on, but I'm also interested in knowing a bit more. What is bothering me in particular is that in the video the doc is referring to various leads as ""views"" of the heart. He says Lead I is a top view, Lead II is a view from the left etc. However, I'm not really picturing how the placement of the leads effects the reading of the machine. For example when the SA node fires, it sends an electrical impulse through the entire body, so wouldn't every lead that is on the body just pick up the same kind of a 'spike'? So how does the placement of the electrode determine direction of ""view"" if the electrical signals are transmitted equally through the entire body?Ôªø

Another thing is that some comments on there were saying that he identified the ""views"" incorrectly? If anyone has time to double check the information that he is presenting I would really appreciate it.

So, I am a medical student attending the 2nd year and here in my uni we don't get a lot of chance to practice and to ""touch with our hands"". I mean, I'm studying anatomy right now, and yes we have access to a lab with bones and models of muscles, organs etc. but really nothing else. Don't get me wrong, I'm fine working with that (even though, since I'm far away from my uni, I do not go there very often and I prefer using software like AnatomyLearning at home), but recently an association came up with something very interesting: a pig heart dissection. Now, at first I was like ""great!"" but then I discovered that I have to pay a quote for entering this association (not much at all actually, like 10‚Ç¨-11$), but, even more ""unfair"", there are only 15 places available (with more than 150 people only in my year). Now, I don't get mad on this, I mean, it's not unfair really, it's an association of students and people who really want to help, but I don't like the idea that:

I have to rely on an external association to do something which I think the uni should care about (just to be clear, in my uni ALL the Anatomy and Phisiology lessons are frontal lessons where you listen to the prof, no lab (except for the bones and models as I said) at all)

There are only a few spots for something which maybe it's not essential to learn anatomy, but sounds really fun and helpful :)

So, why am I writing here? I need help because I'd like to try that at home :) My idea is to get a pig heart/kidney at a local butchery and then follow some video tutorials (like THIS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN7aVXEkFzg) since I can't have a cardiologist/pathologist like the association does xD

So, my question is: do you have some material that you think I might find useful?

Background: I am a computer scientist working in the medical imaging field, currently focusing on computer aided detection/diagnosis of coronary artery disease. I am familiar with XA, CTA, and OCT, and also know a few things about IVUS and (non-related to CAD) cardiac US and a tiny little bit of cardiac MR. I also know a few things about EKG.

Aside from the technical stuff, I know the basics of the cardiac function and anatomy and I am able to ""see"" the abnormalities (i.e. stenosis, plaques) in the imaging modalities mentioned above. I also know the basics of a MI and of a PCI (i.e. I can understand what the clinician is doing, and why). But, I want to learn more :). I would like to reach the point where I could look at a cardiology report and understand everything that is mentioned there, and also correlate the report with the available imaging. Even better, I would like to be able to pinpoint the obvious things by looking at someone's imaging and EKG (ofc, I won't be able to put a diagnosis, nor do I want to). I would also like to learn more details regarding the cardiac function (for example, why a MI can cause an elevated ST segment or an inverted T wave and what are the implications of these changes). Basically I want to be able to correlate things.


So what I am asking for is a guide to be able to learn this. Maybe some video lectures, or some good blogs, or some not very technical articles (but not for dummies either). What I learned so far is mostly based on discussions with people that understand/know more than I do and Wikipedia (I know, perhaps not the best source, especially when it comes to cardiology). Unfortunately I don't have a cardiologist available for my newbie questions :)

&#x200B;

I'm trying to understand the pressure-volume loop, and am a bit confused about what would happen if diastolic blood pressure is increased.

Does stroke volume increase? And if so, why?

My thinking is:

1. If DBP goes up, ejection (i.e. aortic valve opens) at a higher pressure, and the pressure-volume curve will hit the Starling curve at a greater pressure, meaning systolic blood pressure will also increase
2. If systolic blood pressure increases, central venous pressure will also increase, meaning there is greater filling of the ventricles
3. Therefore, greater stroke volume, but at a higher pressure?

Is that correct? Because I'm not quite sure about how increasing systolic bp would lead to an increase in central venous pressure.

Sorry if my question isn't phrased well, I'm just trying to understand all of this for the first time! Thank you very much, I appreciate any help. <3"

She‚Äôs seeing me for low back pain, but training for a 5K, so we‚Äôre incorporating some run training into her ther ex. She‚Äôs got an Apple watch which monitors her HR, and she‚Äôs been trained on the RPE scale (6-20).

She reports that she‚Äôs had this in the past while working out, but didn‚Äôt realize it was a big deal that with little effort she‚Äôs hitting sub-max and max levels.

236,Tolerance build up (tachyphylaxis) to beta blockers?,"Hello, I cannot find information regarding tolerance build up to beta blockers. I know that the medication can loses it's efficacy when body increases the amount of beta receptors. For the sake of discussion let's say a patient is taking it for off label use like for dysautonomia or anxiety as sympmtomatic treatment for high blood pressure spikes and/or high pulse and has no functional diseases. Is it never ending vicious cycle that a patient must keep increasing the dosage of the medication so that the med would continue working well, or if you titrate to high enough dosages, the medicaiton will continue working well for long term.

1. Is it inevitable that beta blocker stops working as efficiently as it used to?

2)How often does it happen?

3) In general, what is offered next, increasing the dosage or switching to other type of medication?

4) Does body build tolerance to all anti hypertensive meds?"

238,Why is T wave on ECG so simple compared to QRS complex (normal subjets)?,"Hi everyone, i'm a young student in medicine and I'm currently studying the EKG/ECG.

While studying the different waves of the EKG, I was drawing the parallel with the cardiac action potential and the different local ionic current that occur during each phase of the AP. In my textbook, it is said that we can assimilate the heart as a unique vectorial dipole that is the vectorial summation of each individual dipole created by cardiac fibers when they are in ""activity"" (either being depolarized, either being repolarized). Thus, the depolarization is seen as a complex called QRS and can be decomposed in 3 main vectors (septal activation, apical activation and basal activation). The EKG is thus the projection of the vectors on a plane (frontal plane or horizontal plane). It is explained why it is more complicated than the atrial depolarization. So far, I get that.

I also get why the deflection of the T wave is the same polarity of the preceding QRS, why it is larger and has a lower amplitude. What I don't understand, is why isn't it T wave as complicated as the QRS complex ? After all, the repolarization lasts longer and is more complicated at the molecular level : there are many heterogeneities of distribution within the ventricules concerning the K+ channels, and it should be more complicated, no ? It is said that the wave of repolarization is similar but in opposite direction. Then why does it creates a simple positive dome-shaped deflexion (in normal/healthy subject) and not another complex ?

251,Cardiac Rehab Observations,"47yo male, ex smoker, had good labs at TJ e of heart attack. So December 20th I had a heart attack and a stent put in. Started my cardiac rehab beginning of January. I‚Äôve seen guys come and go. Some last a few days then quit. I wanted to do what my doctor said and do everything to fully recover. One of the guys graduated yesterday, I remember his first day(8 weeks ago). I started wondering why I haven‚Äôt graduated. I asked when my day was and was told I still had a long ways to go, it‚Äôs a 12 week program(why‚Äôs mine 12? Better insurance I assume). She then said since I‚Äôve been skipping the education part of rehab I‚Äôd take longer. The education part is videos, lectures, cooking classes. I own a medium sized contracting company and am busy. 

So because I don‚Äôt go to the education classes much, I need to participate in rehab longer? How does that have anything to do with recovery? To me it‚Äôs them being able to bill for 24 units(1 for cardio and one for education classes). Am I right for assuming this? My cardiologist and primary doctor both say doing great, no damage to my heart, was caught early. I don‚Äôt want to quit but this is my busy season where I make money to last all year. I also don‚Äôt want to lesson my full rehabilitation, I kind of like breathing and having a heartbeat.

252,Consensus about blood pressure readings while not in a resting state,"Hi,

I‚Äôve read a lot about blood pressure and am very interested in the subject. I‚Äôve also read that blood pressure should always be checked after being in a resting state for at least a few minutes in order to produce comparable results.

The general guidelines of staying below 140/90 are also related to the resting state, as far as I know. 

I, however, don‚Äôt seem to read anything about acceptable blood pressure when working out, walking, working (i. e. not being in a resting state) or just being slightly active.

How is the risk of disease evaluated if there aren‚Äôt any guidelines for a slightly active state? Couldn‚Äôt there be health problems for people with spiking blood pressure which return to normal after just a few minutes of resting?

To give you an example, my blood pressure, if checked after being slightly active and sitting down without waiting a few minutes, is, some times, 140/95. However, after a few minutes of resting, it usually drops to values lower than 130/85.

Many thanks!

Sorry if this isn't the place to post about this, I just really need people with knowledge to tell me what's going on.
So basically, this happened close to 6 years ago, around the age of 14 or 15. My parents made the appointment because they were worried I might have some heart defect (my mom noticed the symptoms of a PVC and wanted it checked out, everything was found to be normal though). The cardiologist came in and had me remove my shirt, which I would assume would be normal. He then had me lie down and proceeded to take my pulse on my chest (beginning with gloved hand but I can't remember if he switched to a stethoscope later or not), but after about thirty seconds he started moving his hand down towards my pants, and suddenly slipped his hand under without a single word (I'm male if that makes a difference). He laid his hand against my spot for around 30 seconds, and I didn't do or say anything because I was frozen with fear of what he might do. Then, without a word, he took his hand back out and proceeded like nothing had happened. When I managed to calm down enough I asked why he did that, and he said it was because there was a large artery in that area, but I don't know whether to believe him, and I feel like he should've at least warned me before doing whatever he wanted.

Later he had me go down to another room for an ultrasound, and when he came into the room he made comments about me being shirtless again (""good, you left your shirt in the other room. I like guys who do that"" or something close to that) and it really weirded me out.

I'm just needing to know whether he was just being a jerk in not telling me what he was about to do, or if he intentionally molested me under the pretense of taking my pulse. Again, sorry if this isn't the place for this

I would like to discuss the topic of management of groin access sites with large bore arterial (LBA) access. Last year our department successfully started using the Impella device. At first we only used it in elective cases and went from having a vascular surgeon closing the 12F or 14F arteriotomy in the first few to using two Perclose Proglide devices inserted at a 90¬∞ angle in respect to each other. And this all works fine.

Unfortunately, in patients who need further hemodynamic support after the procedure such as in complicated cases or infarction-related cardiogenic shock and thus are being transferred to CCU/ICU with the Impella pump im situ we repeatedly encounter the problem of bleeding/blood oozing from the insertion site. Until now in the majority of our cardiogenic shock cases the Impella pump had to be removed within one to two hours after patient arrival on CCU/ICU due to bleeding complications from the insertion site.

We tried several modifications with our approach such as removing UFH from the purge solution, avoiding a high arterial access site, verifying that the ACT was < 160 before removal of the peel away sheath, ""tenting"" the repositioning sheath to prevent further opening of the arteriotomy due to mechanical stress - none have been ultimately successful so far.

I want to know how can I get started working on something which can measure the blood flow from the heart when its release. There are machines which monitor the blood flow when the heart pumps blood but nothing which measures the blood flow and the pressure when the heart releases the pressure.

305,CCTA or Nuclear Stress Test?,Since the risk of getting a concentrated dose of high radiation at a younger age in the heart would seem to put you at most risk for lung cancer and a nuclear stress test would be a higher radiation dose but spread more diffusely through the body. Which would be a safer scan to get at a younger age? I have heard lung cancer has a very poor survival chance and many other cancers offer much better chances of a cure so would the higher radiation nuclear stress test actually pose less of a risk down the line of increased mortality?

&#x200B;

""In the heart, hypokalemia causes hyperpolarization in the myocytes' resting membrane potential. The more negative membrane potentials in the atrium may cause arrhythmias because of more complete recovery from sodium-channel inactivation, making the triggering of an action potential less likely. ***In addition, the reduced extracellular potassium (paradoxically) inhibits the activity of the IKrIKrpotassium current and delays ventricular repolarization.*** This delayed repolarization may promote reentrant arrhythmias."""

309,Supraventricular Tachycardia with no symptoms?,"Hello,

Not looking for medical advice. Trying to understand SVT better. Can someone have SVT if they never notice their heart rate above 100 bpm, average bpm of 60-63 bpm every day, no dizziness, no fainting, no shortness of breath, etc? They have a heart rate tracking Fitbit that never shows a heart rate above 100bpm unless walking or working out. The only symptoms they notice are heart palpitations, which occur a few times a week at most minus one episode of hundreds in a day that resulted in an ER visit and a PAC diagnosis after being hooked up to a monitor. If a 14 day heart monitor reported SVT, could these runs be so short(ie a few seconds) that they wouldn't be noticed by the person or the heart monitor at the ER? If the palpitations were related to the SVT, wouldn't the monitor have picked that up in the ER but instead had a clean EKG and a heart rate around 70bpm the whole hour in the ER while palpitations were occuring every 45 seconds or so? Thanks for answering my questions. There are so many different things on the internet that it's hard to understand SVT for me. "

315,Large PFO - Contradicting echocardiogram results and other echocardiogram related questions,"Calling all cardiologists/heart doctors

I'm going to be honest and admit I'm not a medical professional, nor am I a medical student. I am someone who has suffered with ongoing fatigue, shortness of breath, tachycardia and palpitations (came on out the blue) for 7 years without a definitive diagnosis as of yet. My 7 years of experience with cardiologists has led me to writing this post. 

*I am not asking for medical advice or a diagnosis*. I Just have simple question (or two) as a result of contradicting outcomes from top cardiologists in the West Midlands region (United Kingdom) regarding my PFO (a hole in the heart which I am told is normal in 25% of the global population and asymptomatic).

To cut a long and complex story short, I've gone from being able to play football for hours on end, to barely being able to jog 30 metres without severe palpitations, tachycardia and shortness of breath - I have exercise intolerance as well as daily fatigue and bluish nails  (Started in 2012). Since then I've had a few echocardiogram scans including bubble contrast echo to rule out a structural heart problem.

Here's my concern and questions:

In 2012, I saw a leading cardiologist in Birmingham, UK who referred me for a bubble echo which was given the all clear except for a ""Large PFO"" - ruled out as normal and not contributing to my symptoms. No answers from cardiologist and learned to accept my fate.

In between 2012-2018: given nebivolol 2.5mg - given as a trial drug to see if symptoms improved - exercise intolerance still there, but able to do normal activities like stairs etc and walking at a normal pace.

2018: See another cardiologist as a result of chasing up some form of diagnosis and answer for my symptoms - Cardiologist at Coventry Hospital UK decides to get another bubble echo done - result comes out that it's a small PFO (with only a few bubbles crossing) - during this echo they made me do the valsalva maneuver (the one where you strain without exhaling) - something they didn't make me do in 2012.

My question is, how does a leading cardiologist diagnose me with a *Large PFO* in 2012 only for another cardiologist to say its small several years down the line? 

I'm pretty sure from my research as a layman that a PFO cannot close or get smaller, rather it has the potential to open? 

The other thing is, every time I go for an echocardiogram, whether it's a bubble echo or normal transthoracic, the echocardiographers always comment on not being able to see my heart properly due to my ribs being close together - yet the results always come back normal. This is worrying since I'm getting contradicting outcomes as well as comments about unclear pictures.

Would any cardiologist here, given the above situation, warrant a transoeusophageal ultrasound to investigate further and get a clear picture (literally) of the PFO situation? It just seems cardiologists in the UK / west midlands are really reluctant to organise a Transoeusophageal ultrasound.

I would really appreciate any thoughts on this. 

Just need some sort of direction on what other cardiologists would do.

Thanks"

It has always proved reliable: measurements are both reproducible and accurate as compared the standard manual sphygmomanometer.  

I recently purchased a Braun ExactFit 3 based on excellent reviews in technical journals (which included testing) which systematically gives readings about 20 mm Hg systolic and 10 mm Hg diastolic above the Omron.  

The devices use different measurement protocol and I wonder if that may account for the difference: 

The Omron arm cuff inflates to some point above systolic pressure, and measurements are made on the way down: the cuff gradually deflates to record systolic and diastolic pressures which is the way a standard manual sphygmomanometer works. 

The Braun arm cuff records pressures on the way up: the cuff gradually inflates and records first the diastolic and subsequently the systolic pressure. Once above the systolic pressure, no more measurements are recorded and the cuff deflates.

Could the different measurement protocols account for some difference ? Which technique should be considered more reliable ?

I am just curious about my condition and I know other people and medical professionals usually find it fascinating as well. If anything was urgent or my health was at risk I would seek appropriate medical care right away. 


I am a 23 year old female, and about 2 years ago I was shocked to find out that my heart is on the wrong side of my body. I had had suspicions about it since I could only feel my heartbeat on the right side of my body, but I honestly didn‚Äôt think it was possible until I went for a chest X-ray when I was sick and the doctors asked me why I didn‚Äôt mention that I had Dextrocardia. After being diagnosed I went to a cardiologist and had testing done to make sure my heart is healthy and I got the all clear.


Anyway, since I‚Äôve been diagnosed I noticed that there is barely any information about Dextrocardia online. I know it‚Äôs a very rare condition but there is literally almost nothing to find out. So here‚Äôs my questions, I would love if any cardiologists here could answer even 1 of them:

1. Is it strange that in 21 years of life, no doctor has ever noticed that my heart is on the wrong side before? I even had a heart echo done about 6 years ago because I needed surgery on a broken bone and doc wanted to make sure my heart was strong enough. I remember the technician had a very hard time doing the echo but never suspected or checked the other side... I‚Äôve had a few EKG‚Äôs done as well... (wouldn‚Äôt the results looks off somehow?)

2. I have had a heart murmur since I was born. Apparently harmless. Could my it be related to or caused by my Dextrocardia?

3. I have exercise-induced asthma. What are the chances that could be related to Dextrocardia?

4. Though I‚Äôve always been healthy for the most part, I have always suffered with minor annoyances like insomnia, but terrible fatigue during the daytime, very low energy levels, etc. Could any of these symptoms be somehow related?

5. This might sound crazy, but I actually think about these scenarios a lot: if I ever had a heart attack, would the ‚Äòleft side pain‚Äô that is associated with heart attacks occur on the right side of my body instead? Also, do I need to wear a medical bracelet in case of emergency, and how likely would it be that a paramedic would even know what Dextrocardia is if they read it on a medical bracelet in an emergency situation where I was unconscious? 


Lastly if anybody has any cool/helpful/interesting information about Dextrocardia I‚Äôd love to hear it.

367,Decision to include silent MI as a component of the MACE endpoint in a CVOT.,"As I am sure many of you are probably aware, Amarin recently announced top line results from the REDUCE-IT trial. To the surprise of many (myself included), they report that there was a 25% relative risk reduction in the primary MACE endpoint (composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization).

Looking into the trial design a bit deeper I noticed that the MI component of the MACE endpoint included silent MI (you really have to dig to see this - [buried in a footnote on page 142](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/clc.22692)).

As far as I am aware, other recent CVOTs (FOURIER, ODYSSEY, ASCEND) did not include silent MI as a component of the MACE endpoint.

Further, if you look at the MI component of MACE in other trials - it can be quite high (well over half of all event in FOURIER and ODYSSEY trials, for instance).

With the caveat that we haven't seen the full data set yet (hopefully more is answered at AHA in November), does this nuance of trial design change how you begin to think about the early results? How will it impact your NNT considerations (obviously preventing a silent MI is less impactful than a non silent MI).

I have been running consistently for the past 6-7 months. I currently run 4-5 miles a day, 5 times a week. In the past, I've had weeks where I ran every day of the week, but lately have decided to give my body some days off.

I recently came across some articles and research stating that too much running is bad for you, and that it can cause plaque, scarring, among other things, that could cause heart issues, and even shorten your life (the research shows ""all cause mortality"" being higher for high volume runners).

I run because I enjoy it, and was planning on expanding the length of my runs (and heck, maybe even do a marathon one day), but this new research is making me wonder if I should just stay at something like 3 miles per run. In addition, It's difficult to find a recommended amount of running (or limit)."

Anyways, the initial 12 lead showed LBB, repeat about 15 minutes later was the same, then 10 minutes after that the LBB disappeared and it looked like a normal ekg. Only drug that was given by that point was versed for sedation. BP was around 100 at the time of the third ekg that looked normal.

What would cause that change? The BP drop making it easier on the heart? Or just coincidence?

386,Current antiplatelet agents,"Hi guys,

I'm sweeping through some old notes on antiplatelet drugs and trying to get to the bottom of this.

From what I remember while doing cardio rotation, in stable patients we will almost always prefer Clopidogrel over Prasugrel and Ticagrelor.

Same goes to patients post ACS, don't we want most of them to be taking the double therapy Aspirin + Clopidogrel.

So in my mind right now all I can think is we give Ticagrelor pre-PCI.

Prasugrel I don't really see when we give it ? I know it's the same (irreversible) mechanism as Clopidogrel and is more potent, but other than having a higher major bleeding risk, do we only give it when clopidogrel is not efficient ?

I have a few questions about the Calcium Score test, I want to make sure my understand of the articles I've read is correct (I'll number them)

I've originally heard about the calcium score test from my cardiologist and they said it is ""THE BEST indicator of whether you are in danger of a cardiac event in the next X years, even better than cholesterol levels"".  Do you all think that is true?  (#1)

But doing some reading I don't think its all that its cracked up to be.  It only takes into account plaque levels to the heart.  So it only considers potential heart issues but nothing for strokes (well, I guess the name implies it - ""Cardiac"" Calcium Score)

It does not consider:  Blockage to other arteries, for example in your leg or your neck, etc  (is that correct?  #2)

It only considers blockages it doesn't consider the possibility of a rupture due to Blood Pressure so that is still a danger  (correct?  #3)

Since the Calcium Score test is for cardiac events, is there a similar test for strokes?  (#5 - I know, this is outside the wheelhouse of this forum)

407,Professional question from a PT about a patient I‚Äôm treating,"Hey guys! I was hoping you could help me out with something. Cardio was never my strong suit. 

I‚Äôve got a 33 year old patient I‚Äôm treating for an ankle injury. She has a recent history of atrial flutter. It‚Äôs not controlled by medication, but she says it doesn‚Äôt bother her much. Every so often, her heart will race, her chest will get right, she‚Äôll get SOB...and then it goes away. It doesn‚Äôt affect her life in any way other than ‚ÄúHey my heart‚Äôs doing the thing again!‚Äù 

Within the past week she‚Äôs mentioned some mild chest tightness, left arm, and left side jaw pain at rest. No nausea, SOB, or any of the other typical signs of a cardiac emergency. It‚Äôs happened when she was driving (I asked about road rage and she said she was the only one on the road at the time), and when she was just sitting at home. 

It‚Äôs been about a year since her initial diagnosis of the atrial flutter, and about 6-7 months since they had her wearing a 24hr halter monitor, ran an echo, and did a stress test, all with negative findings. I encouraged her to go to the hospital if it happened again, but she‚Äôs already paying off the hospital bills from the last time, and isn‚Äôt looking to pay more. I told her to follow up with her cardiologist, but she doesn‚Äôt want to have them run tests if they‚Äôre going to show that she‚Äôs fine. 

To me it sounds like unstable angina, but again I‚Äôm not a cardiologist. Any insight into what may be going on with her would be appreciated! I‚Äôm going to see her again this week, and I‚Äôd love some ‚Äúthis is what it might be so please see someone‚Äù information to back me up! Thank you!!

I used Larsen Embryology, Langmann and Moore (The Developing Human) for basic embryology, but the section on the conduction system was not thorough at all. I also tried Gray's Anatomy 41st edition (the big one), but this one is really hard to read (and not just because of the annoying font). 

I am interested in knowing the molecular basis of cardiac tissue differenciation, and the factors which play a crucial role in this differenciation, the topographical differences, and eventually an introduction to conduction system abnormalities (such as aberrants pathways).

454,Ishemic Preconditioning (IPC) is an expirmental preconditioning done on the heart to protect it from future ischemia loads. Does the heart natural perform any kind of preconditioning on it's own and without being induced?,"From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_preconditioning), I came across this reading about delta opiate receptors preconditioning the heart.

""Is thought to be stimulated by local action of adenosine, opiates and bradykinin which are all endogenously released by ischemic cells. The presence of each substance is not required but the protection is more potent if they are. They activate G-protein coupled pathways, which carries a protective signal to an end-effector. There have been many suggestions to what this might be, the sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive potassium channel, the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, reactive oxygen species generation, chloride channels, the inward rectifier potassium ion channel and connexon 43 related channels.""

The above suggests that there is a mechanism where adenosine triggers a cascade  to protect against ischemia via influx of adenosine (maybe over time?). Is there a biological basis to this hunch? Does the heart  have the ability to precondition it's self when it suspects a ischemic  attack is on hand? If so please explain "

Im a 4th year med.stud. and trainer for Paramedics in Austria. Last week i was asked WHY Mobitz and Wenkebach are eleminating the signal from the atrium. Grad I and III blocks are easy to explain, due to partial fibrosation and full fibrosation of the AV-Bundle.

Grade II Wenkebach COULD be explained by slower response of the cells because of insufficient oxygen delivery, again because of fibrosation and damage. (On the other hand Wenkebach is sometimes seen in people with high vagotonus, so this doesnt really come by)

So in our witnessed arrest showed asystole, it only made sense to (while following the asystole algorithm), give this patient every chance at breaking that asystole and hopefully saving her, instead of strictly sticking to the asystole algorithm and not act on the possibility that she too many be in five VF and respond to the antiarrythmic.

I am a pharmacy PGY1 finishing the first week of my ED rotation. During one of my shifts, we had a patient arrive by EMS in SVT who had failed to convert after an initial 6 mg and a subsequent 12 mg IV push. The question arose about whether we should repeat a 12 mg bolus or go up to 18 mg bolus. I was under the impression that the ACLS guidelines recommend 12 mg as the max dose of adenosine in SVT as there has not been sufficient evidence to support the increased dose of 18 mg. The decision to repeat a 12 mg bolus was made and the patient eventually cardioverted. Long story short, this piqued my curiosity so I decided to look into it in more depth. Unfortunately, I have not been able to come up with much literature other than a couple articles published in the mid-to-late 1990s. I was wondering if anybody had any input or knew of any additional/recent literature with regards to the 12 mg vs 18 mg dose of adenosine. Any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

With that being said, most providers I work with prescribe an ACE-I followed by an ARB.

From what I understand, the end goal is to reduce the patient's BP to normal levels as that will benefit patients the most. With that being said, do some providers prefer to give ACE-I/ARBs because you don't have to keep track of their electrolytes as often and they still allow you to control their BP effectively? "

505,Pathophysiology of giving calcium in calcium channel blocker overdose.," I‚Äôm trying to understand why EMS gives calcium gluconate to calcium channel blocker overdose. It seems that if the channel is blocked this would be a pointless drug to give. What I found so far is that calcium channel blockers are in two categories, dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines with the later being the ones we really worry about in relation to bradycardia and an unstable patient. The drug targets L-type calcium channels in phase two of the contractile cell cycle and phase zero in the automaticity cell cycle. This doesn't seem to have to drastic of an effect on the contractile cells because the contraction is mediated by calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the cell in a calcium triggered-calcium release mechanism. So phase two of the contractile cell, for the most part, is not greatly compromised because it is still able to get enough calcium to trigger the SR to release resulting in contraction. Phase zero of the automaticity cell is a different story. This cell is using both L-type and T-type calcium channels and the block of the L-type is what the problem is with overdose. The T-type channels take over calcium influx in some way but that's my question, why does giving calcium make the T-type channels be able to keep up to raise the heart rate and help fix the problem? Is more going in at a time,  going in faster, working more efficiently? I‚Äôve had to piece this information together because I can't find an article that explains how its working, just that calcium gluconate is indicated. That said, I might be way off on any of this. This article looks like it could have some answers but I can‚Äôt get it ""Pharmacology, pathophysiology and management of calcium channel blocker and beta-blocker toxicity"", PMID:15898828, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1589882"
506,Pad placement for transcutaneous pacing.,"I'm trying to understand the difference between the anterior-lateral and anterior-posterior pad placement in transcutaneous pacing. I see that both are talked about by Physio and Zoll but many EMS protocols I've seen recommend the anterior-posterior placement. When you look at illustrations of anterior-posterior placement it looks like the pads are very low. If I'm understanding this correctly this is to target the apex of the heart so that the depolarization wave is causing contraction from the bottom up, like the heart normally would, to maximize ejection fraction. Is this correct? It seems like this would be superior to an anterior-lateral placement that would cause a less organized contraction from the right atria then spreading cell to cell. It would also make since that capture would happen at a lower Mv dose. There must be some justification for rolling a patient over to place pads rather than just put them on the front. This would also line up with my understanding of anterior-posterior pad placement for the second set of pads in duel sequential defibrillation. The target of the second set of pads is the apex to compensate for bad initial pad placement or left ventricular hypertrophy. Is this also correct? I anyone has more information on this I would appreciate it, especially if you could site sources."

510,The Potential Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea that may be a major contributor to AFib disease progression,"Mechanical Stretch due to negative Intra-Thoracic Pressure
Obstructive Sleep Apnea is defined as a physiological event that happens when upper airway is partially or completely blocked during sleep. Mostly, as a result of collapsed soft tissue in the throat while lying on your back. This makes your diaphragm and chest muscles work harder to open the obstructed airway and pull air into the lungs. As the obstruction persists, significant negative pressure is developed in the inner space of the thorax. Breathing usually resumes when the sympathetic nerve system is activated, regaining control over the throat muscles and reopening the airways -  ending up with a loud gasp, snort, or body jerk. You may not sleep well, but you probably won't be aware that this is happening.

Since the heart is ‚Äúsitting‚Äù on the diaphragm on the lower end and attached to the aorta and pulmonary veins in the upper part, this negative intra-thoracic pressure is causing the heart muscle to stretch mechanically, potentially causing micro scarring of the left atrial tissue which in turn promotes arrhythmogenic characteristics (in particular Atrial Fibrillation).

Given that a moderate to severe sleep apnea patients experience Sleep Apnea events between 15 and 60 times an hour, or hundreds of times a night ‚Äì the accumulated damage can be significant.

 

Frequent interruptions to the sympathetic nerve system
As described above, most sleep apnea events end with a surge of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nerve system. It is also known that the heart electrical system is tightly connected and to some degree regulated by this exact same system.  Therefore, it is assumed that the load sleep apnea is imposing on the system has a profound impact on the promotion of irregular electrical activation patterns or arrhythmias.

512,Question Regarding Advancements in Cardiology + Testing,"So I can't seem to figure this out for the life of me.  My dad, healthy, active vegan who's never smoked nor consumes more than the odd glass of wine, almost had a full heart attack.  Had mild chest pains and they found a full blockage.    


Kevin Smith, who was quite heavy at one point but lost all his weight, just about died of a heart attack, full blockage.    

So I know the routine now, chest pains > stress test > results > scope > action etc.    

My question is, why in 2018 are we still waiting for symptoms to tell us there's a massive blockage.  Why isn't there some sort of 'once per year' testing that can determine what is going on in the ticker.   

I know lipid profiles can be indicators but they can also not be.  I've  recall reading somewhere about an isotope that light up your bloodstream to show any potential blockages but I have yet to read or hear about this in practice.

My question is: why does that have beneficial effects, but other things that increase your heart rate as well like -  getting scared/panicked, going on a roller coaster, taking stimulants (like coffee, cigarettes, or adderall), or being overheated; either have no beneficial effects on your heart at all, or can actually cause harm/negative effects?"

518,Had a TEE cardiologist said it was weird and asked if I had an eating disorder? What?,May I ask what that means or what she was referring too?

519,Is there an evidence-based answer for 'Would you rather have a STEMI or NSTEMI?' (answers for short term and long term may be different),"Hi everyone, UK final year medical student here.

A few months ago, on my immediate life support (ILS) course/day, the instructor asked us if we would rather have a STEMI or an NSTEMI. While the majority of the class said they'd rather have a STEMI, and this answer was deemed 'correct' by the instructor, I strongly said that I'd rather have an NSTEMI. Their logic was that a STEMI is much more easily diagnosed and treatment initiated, whereas an NSTEMI isn't. My logic was that just because something is identified and treated in an invasive way as soon as possible, that on its own is certainly not evidence of better prognosis in the long run, and I'm well aware of the psychological bias/fallacy in thinking that a condition is going to get much better just because we see that something is being done about it (which is also the driver behind the placebo effect), and our partiality for more invasive interventions (such as PCI) over medicines. In addition, my understanding is that in an NSTEMI, most likely the infarction is subendocardial, whereas for STEMIs, it's transmural and I inferred that as full thickness (STEMI) sounds like more myocardium is damaged, NSTEMI probably has a better prognosis in both the short and long term, despite the lack of emergency PCI, although this was purely theoretical. In the longer term, NSTEMI patients usually get PCI within a few days anyway, so the immediate PCI advantage to STEMI is then negated. We couldn't discuss it further as no one else really thought it was important enough to dwell on.

Having looked up some papers, I'm not too much clearer on the question 'Does STEMI or NSTEMI have a better prognosis (both short and long term)?', but would love to know what the current state of evidence on this is.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21791326
This seems to show that NSTEMI has a worse prognosis in the long term.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307524/
This seems to show that it's at least the same prognosis in the long term, but STEMI has a worse prognosis in the short term.

https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/28/12/1409/2887253
This seems to show they have the same prognosis.

However all the above only include in-hospital patients. I suppose out of hospital patients are impossible to study this question on?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardiology/comments/7ppq0w/difference_between_a_stemi_and_nstemi/
In this previous reddit thread, the conclusion seemed to be that it's basically impossible to tell and there's a lot of overlap in prognosis. However, I struggle to believe that in a field like cardiology, there's not enough evidence to answer a question like this 

Also, what I'm learning from reading the papers is that NSTEMI patients tend to be older, female and have more risk factors overall, whereas in STEMI patients, the MI is a bit more...unexpected/sudden. Is this right?

EDIT 1: Question should be 'Would you rather be a STEMI patient or an NSTEMI patient?' 
Also, are these studies I've linked reliable or are there some bigger/landmark studies I'm missing?"

522,I have a couple of questions about electrophysiology that I'm confused about.,"I'm reading a book called ""ECG Interpretation from Pathophysiology to Clinical  Application"".


1. I read that depolarization and repolarization go in opposite directions, depolarization goes from endocardial cells to Epicardial cells, and repolarization is from epi to endocardial cells due to Epicardial cells having a shorter action potential duration. If a wave of depolarization (ex. Ventricular) travels in the direction of a positive electrode we see a positive deflection (QRS complex). Going by that logic, shouldn't repolarization  (T wave) normally be inverted, not the same direction as the QRS?


2. In LV hypertrophy, why does repolarization reverse?

3. Why does the left bundle branch depolarize first, causing septal depolarization from left to right. If the left bundle branch depolarizes first, wouldn't the electrical depolarization travel to the left ventricle first?

I would like some help understanding what exactly this diagnosis means and if it really is super dangerous or not. I will be upfront and say that yes, I was diagnosed with this condition, and I am 27 years old and male, (which makes it very rare for me). I'm not seeking medical advice, moreso education on this subject because almost EVERYONE I talk to (including doctors) have never heard of it, and I get very little information on it from the place that -did- diagnose it. (Apparently it's still being studied?)

The chest pains I have are greatly impacting my life and the constant worry about having a heart attack or something has caused me to make many visits to the ER. I feel like i'm stuck in a bit of a circle here, because I can't be sure this -WONT- cause a heart attack, so when the chest pain gets bad, my options are either go get checked out, or ignore it and possibly take a risk.

So, how dangerous -IS- coronary microvascular disease? Is this something that can kill me? Are my fears for good reason or am I overstressing about this? Does it cause heart attacks? I've heard from doctors that do know what it is, the entire spectrum from ""Oh that's nothing"", to ""it's very serious and should be monitored"".

I know this isn't exactly the best place to post this, but I feel like this board probably has more people specifically into cardiology, and this is such a difficult subject."

I'm not sure if this is entirely appropriate. In 1997 at the age of 4, I had a coil occlusion done. I am trying to see if anyone could potentially name a manufacturer of coils used during this time for this particular procedure. I want to contact the cardiology team again, who told me to refer to medical records, to see if this brand or manufacturer could potentially be the one used during the procedure. 

I only want a potential manufacturer because nowhere in the medical notes is it mentioned. I am desperately trying to find out and try to give the cardiology team some sort of, ""hey is this it!?"" kind of nudge so that they can write me a letter for MRI clearance for it being safe. I know the very costly dangers of having something magnetic in an MRI machine. The cardiology team has vaguely said, ""yeah it should be MRI safe but it will cause some interference in the imaging."" But, for me and for the hospital I would like the MRI done at, and any other future hospitals, this is not enough.

From the medical records/physician's notes:
> In the right femoral vein, a #7 French sheath was placed. In the right femoral artery, a #5 French sheath was placed. From the right femoral vein, a #7 French balloon end-hold catheter was advanced and a right heart catheterization was performed. From the right femoral artery, a #5 French pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending and descending aorta. The first biplane cineangiogram was then obtained. After careful calibration, the ductus was measured to be approximately 2mm at the pulmonary end with a lumen diameter of approximately 4.2 mm at the aortic end. The pigtail catheter was then withdrawn and a #5 French Berenstein catheter was advanced with the aid of a guide wire across the ductus into the main pulmonary artery. A 5 mm, 6 cm, 0.38 coil was then deployed across the PDA. 

Any leads would be a great start. If you want me to dissect more into the notes for your cardiology pleasure, please let me know. This is definitely my medical record."

When measuring the BP changes, does it matter if you only look for the BP drop during ACTIVE INSPIRATION or can you alternatively ask the patient to take in a deep breath and hold it. 

It seems to me that taking a breath and holding it would eliminate the negative intrathoracic pressure as it would equalize. (As opposed to maintaining the negative pressure by, say, continuous inhalation against a closed glottis, like a negative Valsalva.) Further, increasing lung volume --> pooling of blood inside the lungs, but would this not too equalize with time if the patient were to hold their breath at max inspiration? 

When I have tested for paradoxus, I've just had the patient breath normally without pausing, but I've seen residents/fellows use vastly different methods (eg have patient take deep breaths, pausing at top, etc...).

570,Relative refractory period and Arrhythmias? Your response would be highly appreciated!,"Hey. As it is known the general consensus is that PSVT or SVT are generally benign and not dangerous/life threathening([1](
http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0615/p2479.html) [2](http://www.cardiovascularcentre.com.au/supraventricular-tachycardia-ablation),...). Studies have shown that PSVT or SVT(more specifically AVNRT which is the most common type of PSVT/SVT), is initiated when the heart is in the *relative refractory period* of AV node([3](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/43/5/679.full.pdf) [4](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/43/1/15.full.pdf)). From the studies:
>Atrial premature depolarizations (APD) falling within a specific portion of the *relative refractory period* of the atrioventricular (A-V) conduction system initiate SVT. 

>SVT was always and only initiated by APDs occuring during the *relative refractory period* of the A-V node.

Now to my question. It is said in many sources that if electrical stimulus falls on relative refractory period life threathening arrythmias can occur. More specifically if stimulus occurs during Atrial vulnerable period(AVP) it may trigger atrial fibrillration, if stimulus occurs during Ventricular vulnerable period(VVP) it may trigger ventricular fibrillation ([5](https://books.google.si/books?id=mWosDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=avp+relative+refractory+period&source=bl&ots=1xuX4_gNcb&sig=L27OuiUu9cqsxwdDTFjGRBQ4vHs&hl=sl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN2YjyppPXAhVNI1AKHf8xB8AQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&q=avp%20relative%20refractory%20period&f=false)). For easier viewing [here](https://ibb.co/fkBGvm) is enlarged version of the image from the previous link , which shows location of AVP and VVP in relation to relative refractory period.

I would like to ask you next things:

1.Looking at the image, period of atrial vulnerability(AVP) extends into the relative refractory period(RRP), right?

2.How is it possible that PSVT/SVT are considered generally benign and not life threathening, since we know that they originate during relative refractory period(which is also part of atrial vulnerability period), and given that any electrical impulse during AVP period can trigger atrial fibrillation, wouldnt this mean that every PSVT/SVT would also
iniate atrial fibbrilation?

3.Can PSVT/SVT also be triggered during ventricular vulnerability period(VVP) part of relative refractory period? If PSVT/SVT can be triggered during VVP, does this mean they can cause ventricular fibrillation, since any electrical impulse during VVP can initiate ventricular fibrillation."

Sometimes when I lift very heavy and push myself I can get arrhythmias but it's rare. However, a lot more often right when I get to the 12-15th rep of my pull ups my heart goes kinda funky. It's around this rep where I'm really pushing my body, I can't do anymore past 18-20 reps in a row. When I stop doing pull ups my heart returns to normal after a minute. This pretty much only happens when I do pull ups.

I never get arrhythmia's when I run and cutting pre-workout and caffeine from my diet has diminished the arrhythmia occurrence, but I'm not gonna lie I'm scared about having one of those enlarged hearts.

590,Cardiology publication weight in terms of fellowship application.,"To the program directors of cardiovascular disease medicine fellowship or those ranking applicants. First thank u for taking the time to read and respond. I have a question regarding the weight of publication affecting the rank/competitiveness of an applicant who has publication and for those who don't. I am currently a pgy-2 IM resident in a medium sized community hospital applying to cardiology fellowship in about a year. 
I understand that having a publication is better than none. I am trying to create a retrospective study at my community hospital to boost my CV. However, when spoken to my research mentor, he was explaining to me that I did not need an IRB for the specific study I am trying to achieve and can still publish but will have to write the exemption in the publication. Basically, this will be more or less of a QI/PI project within the hospital. His logic is to avoid the hassle of IRB approval and the entire process itself considering how difficult it is to get IRB approval. Additionally, my retrospective study will not be ground breaking, and I do not anticipate it to change the practice of cardiology.  
So my question to cardiology fellowship PDs or those interviewing/ranking applicants, how in depth will one analyze an applicant's publication? will it hurt if I publish my findings/study not IRB approved? "

Isn't the ekg leads representing the potential difference between two points?  For example, if you froze the heart in the middle of ventricular depolarization at the peak of a T-wave, if the EKG was allowed to run it should remain flat at the peak of the T right? Or would it go back to baseline due to no active vector? "

602,My Story 11 Years After Heart Surgery For An Atrial Septal Defect,"I lived a pretty normal childhood in terms of my health. I played in many sports leagues and was always playing in the backyard. That all changed when I got to high school. I always had trouble gaining weight, feeling tired, trouble breathing but things had become really alarming.

I ate whatever I wanted and never gained any weight. I was 5‚Äô11 and only 100 pounds. I knew that wasn‚Äôt normal. Of course, being in high school I could certainly forget about getting any girls at only 100 pounds. They always ignored me. I would literally flip a coin on many days to decide if I would stay home from school because I felt sick pretty much everyday. I had trouble going up stairs, heart palpitations, tired all the time, etc. I even told my mother that there‚Äôs no way I can feel like this and keep going. I predicted that I would be dead in the near future. She told me ‚Äúno way‚Äù or something like that.

I went to the doctor for my normal check up and my life then changed. A nurse practitioner started listening to my heart and had a puzzled look on her face. She then listened for probably half an hour. She noticed I had a very noticeable heart murmur and then I was referred to a cardiologist.

The cardiologist visit consisted of many tests such as the ultrasound, EKG, stress test, etc. I remember running on a treadmill at an incline to test my cardio. I got so tired and out of breath, my vision pretty much faded to black. The cardiologist confirmed I had a very large heart murmur and a large Atrial Septal Defect. It turned out my prediction of dying in the near future was probably right. The doctor told me my hole was so large that it needed surgery in the next few weeks. He told me the risk of stroke or other problems was high enough to where they told me I might not live another few years if I did not have surgery. The plan was to have my hole closed with a septal occluder device.

The time for surgery came and my family was there for me. I remember we had to go through a bad neighborhood to get to the hospital and my parents told me to lock my doors and roll up my windows. I remember my parents waiting in the hospital room with me until a nurse came. She was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. She told me she was going to inject something into my arm. She tried a few times but kept missing the vein or something. Of course me being a young teenaged boy, I saw this beautiful woman and didn‚Äôt care one bit. It was just more time to look at her. She injected me with probably the same thing Walter White got injected with before his cancer surgery on Breaking Bad. I know this because my mother said it made me very loopy, giggly, etc. I think it‚Äôs just something to relax you before surgery so you don‚Äôt panic.

Next thing I remember is waking up and having the doctors tell me things about the surgery. It was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life. The tubes they used to go down my throat were too big and it scratched up my throat. It hurt so much, I couldn‚Äôt even breath through my mouth without feeling terrible pain. I couldn‚Äôt talk either because of it. I‚Äôm sure my family was worried but I couldn‚Äôt tell them anything to comfort them. I remember my cousin stopping by to see how I was feeling. I think I remember writing down on a note that I couldn‚Äôt talk. I then remember not being able to eat anything because of my throat.

I was watching TV that night for my hospital stay and saw the Red Sox were on. It was an exciting game that came down to the bitter end. Jason Varitek ended up hitting a walk off game winner. It brought some light to a very trying day.

My mother decided to sleep on the chair next to me for my overnight stay. She has always been a very loving and supportive mother. We walked out the next morning on her birthday. It was probably the best birthday gift a mother could receive.

I had to refrain from any strenuous exercise for about a month before going back to the gym or doing sports. I did web and graphic design for money in high school, so I really went hardcore into that while I recovered. I was very talented at such a young age of only 15.

I made sure to tell my shop teachers in school about it as well. I would pretty much sit around talking to other guys in shop class and not really lift anything. When it came time to get back into things, I noticed a big change. I was able to lift about an extra 20 pounds on any exercise machine and run for longer without losing my breath. I pretty much felt like a new person. I‚Äôm sure some of that was mental but it certainly felt real.

The head of the vocational part of my high school had me meet with him in his office and told me he had heard about my surgery. He told me I could no longer be in shop class anymore and he was mad that I didn‚Äôt tell him. I did tell my teachers but I did not tell him. I basically never saw the guy so I didn‚Äôt even think of telling him. Rather than spending almost half the day in shop class, I returned to taking regular classes.

Another thing I missed out on besides girls or shop class was sports. I was always a great athlete but could not pass a physical because of the heart murmur I still had. I thought I could have had a chance at a scholarship if I ran track but couldn‚Äôt pursue it.

Sadly, I graduated into the great recession in 2008. There was no work for my brother in construction. The freelance web and graphic design work I was doing also dried up. My family pretty much pressured my brother into joining the military. I had always been close with my brother and did a lot of thinking about joining the military as well. We both decided on the Air Force.

My brother being the always healthy guy he is, got accepted pretty easily. Me, on the other hand certainly did not. I had a lot of trouble making the weigh ins because of my trouble gaining weight. I finally passed the weigh ins and had my physical. The doctor noticed my spine seemed to be curved too much and had me get an X-Ray. The X-Ray tech told me my heart glowed like a light bulb.

I met with the doctor and he told me they found my device and I could feel my face turn beat red and my heart beating. I told him about my heart and he said they couldn‚Äôt accept me.

I felt pretty hopeless for quite a while. I wanted to go in with my brother and start a new life. Here was another thing my defect had held me back from. First it was girls, then shop class, then athletics, and now the Air Force.

I spent much of my time playing basketball to help with my depression and anxiety. Every time I played, I had an escape from my troubles. I ended up breaking my ankle from having someone fall on me and needed surgery to repair it.

The anesthesiologist before surgery told me ‚Äúyou know you have a really big heart murmur right?‚Äù. That pretty much made my mind even worse. I was unable to walk for months and months without crutches. I felt terrible pain every day.

I saw my cardiologist and they ran a bunch of tests and told me my heart was fine. The chest pains were not from my heart. They said that I seemed depressed and the chest pain was most likely in my head. They had me talk to a psychiatrist right after seeing my cardiologist. I spoke to him about my situation and he knew that I had depression and anxiety. The chest pains I was having were from anxiety. He told me I could start seeing him if I had anymore problems.

My days consisted of taking pain killers, watching TV, going to the library with my mother and playing games. I had just moved to a different town and did not have any friends besides people I played basketball with. I obviously couldn‚Äôt do that anymore so I basically didn‚Äôt see anyone but my mother and my Aunt that I lived with.

My addiction the the Vicodin I was taking soon spun out of control. It basically fixed all my problems with pain, depression anxiety, eating, sleeping, you name it. I felt as if it made me a better person. I soon started taking 8-12 a day instead of the 4 or 5 I should have been taking. It was a lot for someone only weighing about 115 lbs.

As soon as my supply ran out and no longer had refills, my life completely changed. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt eat, and was in a lot of pain. It spiraled out of control in the coming days and didn‚Äôt sleep for 4 straight days. I was vomiting for 4 straight days as well. I was overwhelmed with anxiety and vomited for 4 straight days. I had constant chest pain all the time. It was so bad, I thought I was dying. I wanted nothing else but to kill myself but I know I couldn‚Äôt do that to my family. I lost about 25-30 pounds from all the vomiting and decided it was time to face the facts that it was not my heart and it was in fact depression and anxiety.

I spent almost 2 weeks in a mental hospital for depression and anxiety. I found a combination of medication that worked well for me and I felt like a new person. My Aunt that I lived with told me it was the first time she had seen me smile in a long time.

As you can tell, my life has been one long struggle. I have had to fight through a lot in my life including my ASD, heart surgery, Lyme Disease, Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, a broken elbow, broken ankle, ankle surgery, constant back pain from Kyphosis, panic attacks, drug addiction, insomnia, the list goes on and on. I know this is not a cheerful story, but I consider it a success to get through everything I‚Äôve been through in my somewhat short life so far."

I've read several articles on how music, lovers and pets can affect resting heart rate which makes me think there may be some grain of truth to it.

Also, if there is any truth to this, has anyone ever tried making a watch which ticks say, 50 times a minute in order to reduce their resting heart rate? Thanks!

613,Do cardiologists and other professionals find remote ECG monitoring in telehealth useful?,"There are several portable wireless ECG sensors available that enable continuous remote patient monitoring, i.e. the patients are supposed to wear the sensor at home for e.g. multiple days. Usually, the sensor sends ECG data to a cell phone and cloud storage for later processing/analytics and professional evaluation. At least, that's the idea that some researchers in the field have.

Assuming that these devices produce data of good enough quality, do medical professionals find such devices clinically important, enabling better care and easier diagnosis; or are they seen primarily as gimmicks and hype? Do you expect them to be important in the future but are not there yet? I'm asking this as a computer scientist with a potential interest in telehealth research, but am wondering how medical professionals see the field and research papers like [this](http://www.cloudbus.org/reports/HeartBeatAnalysisOnCloud2010.pdf)."

In the event of a poor result (IMT measurement higher than the norm), he suggests yearly follow up scans as well.

The more I research and read up on this test, it seems like a no-brainer to do this early on.  Why is this not standard practice?  Research that I've gathered:

1.  The scan is a better predictor of heart disease susceptibility than blood tests / blood pressure
2. Non invasive
3. Low cost
4. Readily available

EDIT: added explanation of IMT
EDIT: Reworded to better convey meaning

Am I missing something?  Is there data that perhaps this easy test is not as good as a predictor as what it seems?
