1,3.5f with mystery illness 4 children’s hospitals and 14 specialists can’t diagnose,"This is going to be so, so, so long and I’m so sorry. But we don’t know what else to do. I’ve tried to compress it the best I could. 3f with medical mystery. 

First year of life: 
-couldn’t latch until 2 months old 
-refused all food, in all forms. 
-up every 20 minutes every single night, wouldn’t nap longer than 30. 
-had newborn “shakes” that stuck around a year old.
-consistently has BM 60-70% mucus, and majority of time was green. 

February 2017(1 year old): 
-staring spells began 
-CT at hospital was clean, sent us to neuro. 
-EEG performed, no episodes happened, clean. 
-lost all of the words she had and remained non verbal, despite starting speech therapy at 18 months, until over 2. 

Eventually they went away after a few months. Doc said absence seizures are harmless and not to be concerned. Released us from his care. 

June 2017: 16 months old.
-woke up and couldn’t walk. Screamed when weight put on leg. Took to urgent care. Urgent care ran labs and found a sed rate of 44. Referred us to an orthopedic surgeon. Orthopedic surgeon did treatment for transient synovitis. When it became clear that wasn’t the cause, sent us to rheumatology. 

August 2017: 
-diagnosed with Oligoarticular JIA (right knee only at this point).
-started on naproxen.

November 2017: 
-first steroid injection. Kenalog into right knee. 
-two days later, woke up screaming and manically itching legs. Hives sprouted. Face swelled, eyes became black, hives all over neck and face. Started wheezing and gagging, rushed her to the ER. ER said it was an anxiety attack from the itching, not anaphylaxis. 
-steroid injection worked for about two months.

Spring 2018 (2 years old):
-staring spells started creeping back.
-swelling in both knees was coming and going. She was in extreme pain and couldn’t walk more than a few feet. Rheumatologist said it wasn’t arthritis, it was growing pains. Referred to PT. 
-we weren’t super worried about the staring spells, and wanted to wait until the arthritis was sorted out to see neuro. The staring spells were coming more frequently. Her speech therapist asked us if we’d ever had her evaluated for epilepsy, as she sees several kids with it, and our daughters episodes were scaring her. 
-We decided to get her in with neuro. It would be a two month wait.

May 2018:
-second opinion rheumatologist said there was obvious arthritis and sent her for a second round of steroid injections. Allergy had deemed the first reaction as a coincidence, not from the injections. 
-had an allergic reaction to the injections again. 
-she begins collapsing and falling pretty much non stop. To the point where PT and Speech therapists were suggesting a helmet because she wasn’t catching herself when she fell.

June 2018:
-steroid injections failed
-our first appointment with PT. PT noticed several left side deficits, severe balance issues (that were worsening), and wrote a letter to neuro suggesting an MRI be done.
-woke up soaking wet, dripping in urine, and her urine was brown. Took her to the ER, ER noted it was brown but testing was normal, and she was well hydrated.
-had an episode where myself and her speech therapist were present. Eyes glazed over and she started walking around like she was drunk. She became delirious. Then that turned into manic aggression (totally out of character). It lasted 20 minutes start to finish, ended with several staring spells. Speech therapist wanted to call an ambulance. 4-5 minutes later, she was completely back to normal. Took her to the ER where they said it was behavioral. I insisted they call neuro, who said it sounded like worsening seizure activity and scheduled an EEG for the next month. 
-pediatrician urged us to go to a different children’s hospital and demand an MRI. CT showed a small arachnoid cyst, MRI was clean. Her left side reflexes were slow, and she had a positive babinski reflex on left foot. 
-lost gross motor skills like squatting or standing up without using hands. Could no longer identify letters, though she had been able to since before 2. 
-discharged after a negative EEG, but nothing happened while she was hooked up. Told us to get video. 
-balance continued to deteriorate, along with left side deficits. 
-got videos of staring spells, neurologist said that it could be seizures or it could be sensory. She passed sensory tests with flying colors, OT said it was highly unlikely to be sensory. Neuro told us to go to a different hospital. 
-things calmed down for about 3 weeks.

July 2018: 
-PT started noticing balance issues worsening again, she wouldn’t catch herself when she fell or even try to. Began falling 2-3 dozen times a day. 
-she began dropping. Like a robot running and then it’s power source dying. My husband and I would have to sprint and throw pillows or our hands under her head to keep it from hitting the floor. We couldn’t be more than a few feet from her. She would collapse, lay there for 10-20 seconds in a haze, and then sit up. 
-July 19th she told us her head hurt. A few minutes later, she looked out of it. I pulled out my phone because it mimicked the look when she had the episode of delirium. She began stumbling, so I pulled her onto my lap. She began aggressively rubbing her face and making weird faces. Her body then began to jerk/shake. Lasted 20 seconds. When it stopped, she continued to lay down, still, with her eyes glossed over. Her urine was brown again. 
-pediatrician sent us to ER. Admitting doctor said it was a tonic clonic seizure based on the video. Was attached to a vEEG for 9 hours, nothing happened. EEG was clear. Doctors said it was behavioral and “released her from further neurological care.” said there was nothing wrong with her. They called her speech therapist who was livid, as she had been watching her deteriorate right along with us. I needed backup since the doctors were blowing me off. Doctors told speech therapist it was behavioral and from sleep deprivation. But she slept 14 hours a night. 
-as month goes on, she’s dropping and having staring spells non stop. 
-PT says nothing about daughters exam makes sense. Her balance is awful and deteriorating when walking, standing, crawling, kneeling, but she can jump. She’s developmentally advanced so it doesn’t seem lime it could be a developmental issue. She’s also watching my daughter turn into a shell of herself and is begging doctors to do something.
-MRI of knees and hips was ordered by new rheumy after worsening gait issues. MRI showed a healing stress fracture in the knee, along with bone marrow edema (with no trauma to explain it) 
-went limp on a ride at six flags and her eyes rolled to the back of her head for a full 2 minutes. 
-went to playground and she was climbing one of those coils. Body went limp and she fell 5 feet. I caught her and set her down while her arms twitched and she was unresponsive. Slept for several hours after, and took several minutes of shaking to wake up.

August 2018:
-basically everything continued with no answers from anyone. 

October 2018: 
-a 3 day inpatient EEG was scheduled and nothing happened. I mentioned to the doctors that it looked like a mass was growing on her legs and they didn’t look. Sent us home.
-pediatrician saw the masses and sent us to orthopedic surgeon.
-the muscles in her left knee began to atrophy, despite her being crazy 24/7. She never sits still and is always jumping/climbing/running. Orthopedic surgeon said it was definitely neurological, sent us to a new neuro. The atrophy was so bad we were approaching loss of mobility. She still can’t walk for more than 1-2 minutes at this point. 
-atrophy worsens until November. Other symptoms start to go away. 

November 2018: 
-started methotrexate injections for the JIA. 

January 2019: 3 years old.
-urine began to darken again. 
-symptoms started popping up mildly. 
-had episodes where she’d scream and rub her legs manically saying “bees were attacking her.” She did it both while we were there, and when we weren’t. I watched her do it on the baby monitor in the middle of the night.
-neuro ordered MRI of spine. Normal. 
-on jan 16th, I heard noises in her room. I looked on monitor and she was sitting and swaying in her bed. I got to her bed to put her back down and by then, she was jerking. I tried to get her attention but she was unresponsive and eyes were glazed over. 
-I pulled her onto my lap, where she remained out of it. Her body was jerking, and her right leg started convulsing like it was on a washing machine. Once the jerking slowed, I asked her to point out her nose and mouth. She failed but thought she did it. I put her back to sleep, where she remained restless. Her urine was normal again 2 days later. 
-urine brown again on Jan 25th. Had a staring spell at a birthday party and was unresponsive for 30 seconds. Fell asleep in the car 10 minutes later, slept for 45 minutes, and then woke up screaming. Continued to scream for almost an hour. Urine was clear again a few days later. 
-Neuro tested for porphyria. Corproporphyria level was 2.5x adults “high normal” but said it wasn’t high enough to be porphyria. No pediatric reference ranges exist. 

February 2019: 
-fingers started severely pruning and turning white in just a few minutes, while her sisters hands (who was 1.5) were completely normal. 
-throughout all of this, little bite/pimple like bumps showed up on face/neck/joints. They come and go. In February, they got bad. No fleas, no bugs, always accompanied other symptoms. 

March 2019:
-GI said that while she’s tall, she’s short based on how tall she should be since I’m 5’10 and husband is 6’4. Wanted to run tests. Thinks there’s a larger autoimmune disease at play. 
-genetics said that something is definitely wrong, doctors needs to coordinate. Said porphyria test could have been deteriorated because it sample taken at home and exposed to light in the car. Said he’s concerned by the progression and created a team of doctors to evaluate her case. Was afraid it was possibly life threatening. 
-testing was planned for summer when she began showing symptoms again. She remained asymptomatic. 

September 2019: 
-things remained calm, arthritis was under control. 
-began flaring in both knees and both ankles.
-staring spells, balance issues, and not catching herself came back. 

October 2019:
-things are worsening again. 
-left ankle is atrophying. Neuro won’t call me back.
-PT is concerned she won’t be able to walk soon because the stuff that atrophied last year has never come back. She still can’t walk more than a few minutes without collapsing. Sleeping 13 hours a night. Is complaining of pain and isn’t eating. 
-preschool teachers reporting odd behavior and lots of collapsing. 
-most recently broke her wrist because she fell down the stairs and didn’t try to catch herself. She landed on face and chest, with her arm against her chest.
-ETA: her urine was brown again this morning for the first time since spring.

Any ideas? We’ve been to four children’s hospitals and will be pursuing new ones when we move in February. I’m so scared for my daughter and still can’t understand the lack of concern by the doctors we’ve seen. I don’t want my daughter to suffer anymore and I don’t know what else I can do.

Thank you so much."
2,I was bitten by a venomous snake. (I did go to ER) What should I expect for healing? And what should I make sure to do or not do?,"36yo F. 5’2”. 170lbs. Prescribed Percocet but have only taken maybe a total of 4-5 pills since the bite.

On 10/31 I was bitten by a venomous copperhead snake. I was bitten right below the ankle. I was taken to the hospital and observed for 10 hrs, no antivenom was administered. I was given little guidance about the healing process and what to do. 

So my question is what should I expect for healing time? As of today I have better range of motion in the limb. Initially during hospital observation I did not swell past the knee. After coming home I did get swelling into my thigh (the papers I got from ER said this is normal as fluid shifts). I still can not bear weight on my foot at all. And standing and the gravity that comes from standing causes intense pain in the lower leg. 

I have a question about rehabbing the leg. I know with some injuries moving through the pain promotes better healing but I’m not sure what to do in this instance I don’t know if forcing myself to use the crutches even though it causes pretty intense pain is the right thing or if I should just keep resting, elevating, and exercising it while laying down as I have been doing this far is best until standing causes less pain. 

I have a follow up with my gp on Thursday 11/7. But because there seemed to be such minimal knowledge from the ER docs I saw I am worried that my gp may not have much experience with snake bites and so I want to go in prepared to ask or advocate for anything that might need to be done. Any guidance you guys can provide would be appreciated!"
3,Shoulder pain is just getting worse and worse and I'm at the end of my rope,"23 year old, Female, 5'4 140~ pounds

October 2018, I started feeling a dull ache in my left shoulder. It was bothersome but manageable and it felt like I just slept on it wrong.

In March 2019 it was getting worse. I could no longer lift my left arm over my head. I went to my local urgent care, paid $300 out of pocket, she poked my shoulder and said it was a muscle spasm. She gave me medication and sent me on my way.

May 2019, I downed the entire bottle and nothing improved. So I went back to the same clinic but a different practitioner. He did an xray which was clear. He shrugged his shoulders, I paid $500, and was sent on my way.

July 2019 I couldnt take it anymore. My grip strength was weakening and I couldnt dress myself anymore. I went to an orthopedic hospital. Once again, clear xrays, he poked my shoulder, said it was tendonitis, gave me medication and a list of home exercises to do and sent me on my way. Over $2000 is now owed to the hospital.

At the end of July I was robbed and my medication was stolen, I also was laid off from my job, so I havent been able to afford going back to any doctor. I still did the home exercises.

Now, here we are, November 2019. My shoulder pain is quickly worsening and has spread to my outer arm and the left side of my neck. I finally got a job but work overnights and can no longer sleep because of it so I feel awful. I stopped eating as well.
I need to go back to the doctor, but I have no money, no insurance, and I'm terrified of being told they dont know again or that its nothing.

I'm at the end of my rope. I dont know what to do or what this could be. Please anything I could suggest to the doctor helps. Or any test I should ask about. I know it sounds dramatic, but I cant live like this anymore."
4,[SERIOUS] NSFW - 31m. Adderall makes me have gay thoughts and is the only time I masterbate to gay porn. Is this normal?,"Umm, so yeah, this is weird.

I live with my gf.  Have never had a gay experience, and while I can acknowledge if a guy is good looking or no, I've never had any gay, urges, thoughts, or desires.  I never saw a penis and wanted to see more.

For the last few weeks, i've been taking adderall (with a prescription) and i've had gay fantasies and have been jerking off to gay porn.  I still have sex with my gf and she still turns me on, but whenever I go to masturbate, my desire is for gay stuff.

After its worn off, I feel really weird about what's gone down, and I've even watched the same videos, but it does nothing for me, except weirds me out.

When I searched reddit, somebody else had posted something similar and everyone was making fun of them.  


Is is a normal side affect?  Does it happen to anyone else?"
5,17M Pain in my lower left rib,"This is most likely related to getting hit in the area mentioned during boxing but I don´t have any experience so I would just appreciate an opinion from someone who knows what they´re talking about. My lowest left rib hurts when I touch it or move any muscles in the area. This has been ongoing for about three weeks and I would like to avoid visiting a doctor for something minor if possible

I don´t drink, smoke or have ever taken any drugs or experienced anything similiarly before."
6,I have been struggling with HORRIFIC Bad Breath for years - Please help!,"I am 25M, 6’0 215lbs. I do not take any medications. No smoking or vaping



I have had very bad breath since 2011 and it is constantly getting worse.   It is to the point where I avoid as many people as I possibly can to avoid the embarrassment that is sure to come as soon as they smell my breath. I have been told I have the worst breath people have ever smelled and I have no idea what causes it or what to do about it. Its messing up my life, my relationships, friendships, and hinders my career. I don’t know what kind of medical professional I need to see to get this diagnosed. 



-Brushing my teeth and mouthwash do absolutely nothing to the smell of my breath, which leads me to believe it is not in my mouth.

-I have to  literally hold my breath around people.

-I can’t have conversation with anyone face to face

-I can’t laugh around anyone because the smell will clear the room. 

-I have to avoid group settings because my breath smells so bad people immediately move away from me and the embarrassment is unbearable.

-I have to hold my breath when I’m within 5 feet of another person 

-Even regular breathing through my nose smells so bad I cannot even breath around anyone else. 

-The second someone smells a hint of my breath they will hand me gum or ask if someone farted or shit their pants.


-Symptoms:

-Horrific Breath - Smells like poop to me. 

-I can taste how rancid my breath is when it moves over my taste buds, which causes a constant bad taste in my mouth - Tastes bitter or like you ate a really burned (black) cookie.

-I have a deviated septum and do have post nasal drip

-Sense of Smell is very bad - I have to be right next to something to be able to smell it

-Sense of Taste seems off - Many foods don’t hold a lot of flavors to me. The primary things I taste are salt and sugar. 

-Alcohol and energy drinks makes it worse



-What I have Tried:

-I have seen my Primary Care Physician, an ENT, Dentist, and a Gastroenterologist 

-My PCP checked for tonsil stones but didn’t find any and then referred me to an ENT. The ENT basically dismissed my concerns, took a quick look in my mouth and said “its probably acid reflux” and after I explained I don’t have any symptoms of acid reflux, she said “well, its probably just the silent kind then. Take some Prevacid” - Which I did for a month and had no change in my breath whatsoever. 

-I then had my PCP refer me to a gastroenterologist. They saw nothing wrong and recommended I see an ENT for further diagnosis. — I have not resisted an ENT yet as this whole process has been embarrassing and feels like I am getting no where.

-I went to my dentist who said everything was perfect in my mouth. 

-I make sure to always brush my teeth 2 times per day and use mouthwash. I have never had a cavity in my entire life. 

-Changed my diet - No improvement 

-Drank more water - no improvement 

-Took probiotics - I think I saw a very minor improvement with this but almost unnoticeable

-Tried a nasal irrigation machine - No improvement 


I have no idea what to do. This is ruining my life and it only seems to get worse. If anyone has any ideas, possible explanations, or even just directing me to the right medical professional to get this diagnosed would be extremely appreciated."
7,Hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces,"I am a 32M and I guess I have been having this issue for a while but this last weekend I really took notice of it.

Last weekend I attended a first aid certification class and I felt like I recognized most of the people in it. It was an uneasy feeling as my mind was racing trying to put together how I may had known them. With a couple of people I genuinely felt I needed to walk up to and say ""hello, good to see you again"". The course was three days and some people I definitely thought I had met before on the first day were total strangers the next, ect. I would estimate throughout the weekend I was determined I had met 75 percent of the 28 people in the class.

The problem is I recently moved 2000 miles away and the city I was taking the course was 4 hours away from where I live now. It was a slim chance that I would even know one person. The feeling was vaguely similar to déjà vu in the way you can't quite wrap your head around it, but very different otherwise. This is also not the first time I have had this happen and it mostly happens in public situations. I really had just passed it off in the past and was not worried about it. But it was so strong this last time I took a mental note to research this feeling. I thought it was probably a weird common thing that the brain does on occasion just like déjà vu, and I wanted to put a name to it and read up on it out of curiosity mostly. Unfortunately I found very little which was disconcerting. I found a few papers calling it Hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces and describes what I was experiencing but with little explanation. Most of these cases were associated with seizures. As far as I know I am in good health and am not currently worried about having these feelings even though it does make social situations tricky.

I am mostly just wanting to further understand what I am experiencing and decided to reach out to see if anyone else has any experience with this and maybe what path I need to take to find out some answers. Hopefully someone can help."
8,"Toxoplasmosis of the Eye, and Brain-Pains.","[Male][Caucasian][20 Y/O][6'3''][396 Ibs]

About to turn 21 but i'm a unique case when it comes to the disease Toxoplasmosis. I contracted it in middle school and the only noticeable symptom is that out of the blue I had lost central vision in my right eye. My mom did what any mother could do and took me to a specialist on this kind of thing. I don't remember much other than constant dilation of my eyes, dieing of my urine, and a Chemo injection into the eye. This was to ensure the parasite that had made itself at home was dead and would stay like that. 

I've attached a link to [Retinal Photography](https://postimg.cc/gallery/l9cl65mq/) of both my retinas for reference. 

Now to the point that's the background have been covered. My bad eye experiences light sensitivity in bright lighting such as being outside or a very well lit room; to the point I have to keep it closed and this has cause my eyelids to begin slouching

I also experience frequent headaches/migraines. Ranging from mild all around to a drill going through my right eye to the back of my skull. And the eye often feels almost sore, where any movements cause pain to the eye. 

These have begun to become debilitating and they have persisted since I was first diagnosed in 08'. So I ask for opinions. Are all these related to my condition and how should I consult my doctors about treating them. As of right now he does not take it nearly as seriously as it is. 

Another note was my mom mentioned something vague about the grey matter of my brain being unusual. appearing that of an elderly person but I don't know how true this statement is. 

Thank you in advance."
9,Can you imagine pain?,"Hey, as someone (20M) who worries and overthinks wayyy too much, is it possible to imagine pains if youre focusing too much on a given area?

Like for example last night while laying in bed i was having a dull ache in my head and then i started focusing on it and thought to make my body sorta ""send help"" in a way i guess to that area, and then 2 seconds later i got a weirs stabbing pain in that exact area. Im really worried about extreme conditions to do with the brain and i dont want a definitive answer, id just like something to put me at ease for now, or told if i should rlly go to the doctor which ill probably do anyways but another opinion is always nice. Thanks for any response"

12,Are white superficial onychomycosis dangerous?,"Hello,
My toenail is getting completely white. No pain, no difficulty to walk or anything. Only one nail (middle one left foot) is affected, no others. I suppose this is a white superficial onychomycosis. 

Is it necessary to visit or doctor?  I'd rather not as it is expensive here.

Thanks!!"

When I stand up my muscle covers over it and coughing doesn’t make a difference because the muscle covers over it. I’m scared this is a tumor/cancer? Any help?"

My grandpa who is 72 had a widowmaker heart attack a week ago and thankfully lived but only because he recently started eating heathier and going to the gym, he used to be heavy set and not do much at all. He would’ve died from it if he didn’t start getting healthier. Anyway I eat like shit and I never exercise and all i do is lay around on a couch or in bed on my phone watching youtube videos or playing video games and now im starting to get scared that im gonna end up getting a heart attack soon because of this. I’ve been like this since I was 12 and its only recently that the food ive been eating is making me out of shape and fatter than I was a year agp. A year ago I could walk up the stairs without having to catch my breath but now its a struggle. 

Anyway im just scared of getting a heart attack and dying. Or even getting healthy, and still getting a heart attack. Cause im going to college in august and i dont wanna die before then. I take asprin, clonidine, toperimate and sertilene, (im pretty sure those are right)."
18,Gastroenterologyst prescribed Levofloxacin for h. plyori. After reading side effects online I am scared to take it. Is it justified?,"Male 32 years old, 180cm, 71kg, white race.   
Current medications: Ranitidine 150mg/day.  
Current conditions:  Polyneuropathy in legs.  

Backstory: I went to a private clinic and paid for the endoscopy because of the constant heartburn and bloating. 
H.plyori test was positive.  
Because I’m allergic to Penicillin, doctor prescribed antibiotics Levofloxacin 1x500 and tetracycline 4x500 + PPI, probiotics and bismuth for 10 days.  

After researching Levofloxacin online I’ve stumbled upon numerous bad side effects such as tendon rupture and permanent peripheal nerve damage. I’m aware occurence of those side effects is low but I tend to have bad luck when it comes to health so I’m paranoid. 

As someone who has diagnosed unknown source polyneuropathia I am truly scared to take this drug. 

Problem is, as this was a private clinic there is no way to contact the doctor and ask him to prescribe something else. He mentioned that those drugs he prescribed don’t have side effects usually. That seemed weird so I started to google it!

Am I being overly cautious about this?
I am aware you can find almost anything you want on google but still I wanted to ask here.   You guys are prescribing antibiotics on a daily basis and I believe you could address my concerns."

It seems to be a very tense muscle. It could be a lymph node maybe? I have also experience ear infection-like symptoms on that same side. I hurts to move my lower jaw to the right. Yesterday I woke up with an extremely painful cramp on my left should/neck, I assume its unrelated. Just want to make sure there isnt some weird disease or something thats going to kill me in my sleep tonight if I dont go to a doctor."
20,Permanent or semi-permanent low cost sweaty hand treatment?,"Age: 26

Sex: F

Height: 5""4'

Weight: 122

Race: Caucasian

Duration of complaint: For as long as I can remember which is about since 10 years old

Location: Canada, Quebec

Any existing relevant medical issues: Severe Anxiety, Social Phobia, ADHD

Current medications: 36mg Concerta, 20mg Paroxetine



For as long as I can remember I have always had extremely sweaty hands and feet, arm pits, groin area and butt. My feet and hands become extremely cold at seemingly random and they sweat at the same time, to the point that even if I'm wearing 3 layers of socks and wool socks the wool socks become humid. The rest of my body feels warm however it's only the extremities that become really cold and sweat. One thing to note is my forehead doesn't sweat nearly at all, even when I'm doing exercise it remains relatively dry, maybe a little bit damp but that's it.

I've asked my doctor about this and she doesn't really have an answer for me, I asked to be recommended to a dermatologist and she doesn't know any nearby, I asked a few family members and they don't either so I am kind of out of luck in that department.

I've seen products like SweatBlock and even Iontophoresis, problem is, I'm not super wealthy.

I'm on social assistance due to not being able to do any job in my region so I don't really have any money to spend on experiments. I do get free prescriptions however which is the main reason I am posting this.

If anyone can recommend any medication that I can then pass onto my doctor I would appreciate it.

I could try a product like SweatBlock but the problem I have with it is, if it works, I now have to buy them on a regular basis. A single box contains 8 towelettes, so say I'm applying them on both hands, both feet, both sides of my groin and both armpits. That's the entire box gone at once, and they claim it lasts 7 days, do I would have to spend 25$ every week...... 

A Iontophoresis device is 500$, sure it's a one time fee and if it works it's a thing I could keep forever. If it works. If it doesn't I'm sitting on a 500$ paperweight. I also can hardly save 500$.

Most of what I do and are good at require my hands to do, mainly building computers and playing video games. I earn a little bit of money on the side fixing computers in my local area. But I've just had it at this point, it's a daily problem and it's extremely uncomfortable.

When I'm assembling computers I have to have a space heater blowing hot air, directly at my hands so they don't become so cold that the joints start to hurt. But they still sweat like crazy and they become very sticky too.

Please help."
21,My doc told me he doesn’t know why I feel the way I do and that’d he see my in a year for my annual physical and I don’t know what to do.,"20, male, 6’, 160lbs, white. I went to my doctor about 6 months ago due to excessive sleepiness, general fatigue, weight loss, and a lack of appetite. 

He ordered blood work, CBC, CMP, and a handful of STD and other infection checks. Everything came back either negative or within normal ranges except H. Pylori which I tested positive for. I wasn’t having any digestive issues but the lack of appetite and weight loss caused my doc to want to treat me. I went on antibiotics and then have a stool sample taken to insure the h. Pylori had been taken care of. 

I met with my doc a few weeks later for a follow up. H. Pylori has been dealt with but I’m still having the same symptoms. I started to gain some weight back though so he took that as a good sign. I also developed a rash of the under side of both my arms. Very small pinpoint red dots. I’ve developed this rash before and it usually goes away completely after about a week. He told me if it persisted to see a dermatologist, as he didn’t know what it was. He told me to see him back in 2 months to see if I had improved. 

Went back, some improvement, mainly in the fact that I had gotten some of my appetite back and gained some weight back. I still felt tired a lot and was sleeping 8+ hours. No motivation and low libido. He told me he doesn’t know why I feel like this and sent me on my way. Last thing he told me was to schedule a annual physical. 

Well after 6 months I don’t feel any better. I’ve began to lose weight again, totally about 10-15 lbs since I saw him at the start. I have 3 very odd chronic symptoms as well. 1. Red pinpoint rash that occurs on underside of arms. Appears maybe every 6 months for the past 3 years and goes away within a week or two. 2. Pain in right testicle that appeared around 3 years ago. Ultrasound showed nothing and I was given antibiotics. Pain reoccurs every 4 months or so. Last a week or two then goes away. Sometimes the pain is more intense and last longer. 3. Pain in right armpit that appeared about 3 years ago. A painful red dot in right armpit appears causing my entire armpit to be sore. Again last about a week then completely disappears. The most concerning of those 3 is the pain in right testicle. My doc knows about the testicle pain and arm rash. A dermatologist I went to for acne took a look at my armpit but because the red painful lump had completely disappeared at that point, she felt nothing. 

At this point I do not know what to do. My symptom list currently is, fatigue/sleepiness, lack of motivation, low sexual desire, the 3 chronic intermittent issues, weight loss, lack of appetite, issues with erections and 0 morning erections. 

Should I get another GP? How do I even began to explain this all to a new doctor? I do believe most of my symptoms could be connected with a mood disorder besides 3 chronic intermittent issues. Any idea of what this could be? And what my doctor should be testing or looking for?"

24,potential cyst near genitalia — treatment options?

all that said — i have a cyst (?) near my genitals, like the title says. it is on my left side, and between my ass and my genitalia— it is not inside of my genitals either, but outside and slightly skewed (leaning more towards the thigh/leg). it is still in an area where pubic hair grows. 

i have had the lump come and go for maybe four years now? it usually just comes once or twice a year, inflates to a 1x1 or 2x2 orb like thing under the skin, and then once it is even painful to sit down (due to the location of it), i can simply apply pressure, and it pops like a pimple, and it’ll go away. i honestly just want to know what this is, if it’s normal (or, rather, not life threatening or something), and what i can do to remove it in a more permanent manner. is this something i could go to an urgent care clinic for? do i need to see a specialist (and if so, what kind)? or it something i just have to deal with forever and if so — how do i treat it myself? 

i have it right now and it’s bugging me a lot — i tried popping it to no avail, even with a sterilised sowing needle, and nothing."

27,When is Low Blood Pressure worthy of an ER visit?,"**Required Info:**
Female. 31 years old. 120 lbs. Caucasian. USA.   


**Diagnosis:** Addisons and ADHD   
**Medication:** Hydrocortisone 3x a day and Adderall 1x a day.   


My BP is almost always 105/68.   


Right now it’s 86/52.   


Yesterday and today the top number has been between 84 and 90.  And the bottom number has been between 50-62.    


I also have a horrible headache, nauseous, and I’m not able to stand for more than 45 seconds without fainting. I also can’t walk more than about 30 steps without fainting. Fainting is no big deal for me. It used to happen all the time before I started taking HC but I rarely faint these days; so this is weird.   



I took an extra dose of HC at 6pm just in case this was cortisol related but it didn’t seem to make a difference. I take my other doses at 7am, 11am, and 2pm if it’s relevant.   


**TLDR** - when is low BP worthy of an ER visit? I feel dumb going to the er because I know the ER is mostly for heart attacks and broken bones. But the low BP combined with feeling absolutely horrible has me a little concerned.  Thanks in advance!

Friends walked me home safely, I fall asleep. Woke up at a normal time with a massive headache and the room still spinning. Ate breakfast (since you're supposed to take the antibiotics with a meal). About 2 hours later I feel something coming up and... come up it did. 

**So with my breakfast in the toilet, I'm just wondering if it was enough time for the antibiotic to get absorbed or if I should take another one?**

I was prescribed Cefuroxime for a throat infection (500mg 2x a day). My doctor prescribed me enough for 5 days (she's out of town until Thursday). So if I take another one eventually I'm going to have to travel to the hospital, wait in line, and pay consultation fees for only ONE PILL.

During our hang outs I'll be hard at times and soft at others, we hang out for a pretty long time too, but I'm never hard the entire time. Anyways, since she came over saturday (4 days ago, our first make out sesh) I had groin pain after a good portion into the hang out. It feels sort of like the aching pain after being kicked in the balls, but I feel it in my dick, particularly in the base, and at a point within my crotch above the base of my dick. I'm not doubling over in pain or anything, but it's definitely quite noticeable and uncomfortable to the point where putting any weight on my dick hurts considerably enough that I have to change positions. It went away a bit after she left and then she came over monday and left just a moment ago (it's 3am tuesday rn for me). The pain returned again this time and she's been gone for half an hour, I am not erect and have not been erect for this time, and the pain is still here. I tried to take a shit and felt a pretty noticeable pain above the base of my dick and closer to my left thigh than my right. I haven't jerked off since saturday and I definitely don't want to touch my dick at all right now, but I don't think this is a case of blue balls or anything. It aches near the base and within my groin, not in my balls or the tip of my dick.

39,"Do ""Asian glow"" supplements reduce the associated cancer risk of drinking?","Bear with me; I tried to do my research here.

My understanding of ""Asian flush"" is that many East Asians have a mutated gene (ALDH2) preventing them from breaking down acetaldehyde, a carcinogenic byproduct of ethanol. This leads to uncomfortable redness/heat in the face and a 6-10x increase in risk for deadly esophageal cancer.

It seems that some supplements such as [Sunset Alcohol Flush Support](https://getsunset.com/) and [Delta Essential AD2](https://www.deltanutra.com/pages/why-essential-ad-2) actually do help with Asian glow, but I worry that they only mask the symptoms while not affecting the increased cancer risk. Sunset appears to claim that they [do decrease the risk of cancer](https://getsunset.com/blogs/news/debunking-the-asian-flush-cancer-risk) with their ""\[precise\] cocktail of \[NAC and\] other complementary compounds,"" while Essential AD2 appears to be [clinically proven](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29509552) to actually reduce acetaldehyde levels.

One author of the clinical study above, Spencer Gordon, is a cofounder of Delta Nutrassentials - I guess this could be taken as either evidence for expertise or bias.

It also looks like antihistamine blockers such as Pepsin can be used to increase the effects of alcohol. Is this a partial solution? (i.e. - if you can get the same amt of drunk w less alcohol, less cancer...?)

So, back to the title: do ""Asian glow"" supplements actually reduce the associated cancer risk of drinking? I'm a 21yo male just starting to drink, and based on family history, I'm almost certain that I'm heterozygous for the ALDH2 gene mutation."

Hey Docs and others!

So on the 13th on August I had a spontaneous pneumothorax. Went to the hospital and got treated with a drain and after 3 days I was good to go. Went for photos again, all good. Got back in the hospital wing and it collapsed again. So got the drain again, and surely enough after 5 days I was good to go. A week goes by and suddenly I get the same pain again, back to the hospital and yes, collapsed again. Got surgery this time and after 3 days it looked perfectly fine again, but boy were they wrong. Got back to the wing again, and AGAIN it collapsed. After 7 days I was good to go, and have been out of the hospital from 7 September until now. In total my left lung collapsed 4 times. So I am feeling good again, but ofcourse scared. I haven't done football again, which is my sport and neither have I done weightlifting. (Skinny obviously, was going to change that.) I was perfectly fit and had great endurance for example. So I can perfectly ride my bike again without any problems, and I have been working again for 3 days a week, 2-3 hours a day in cleaning. (Light work where I can help, no heavy stuff.) I get tired quickly, but no pain. I just feel different, and I don't know if that's just me now forever, or if it goes away etc. Which makes me scared to do something sports related, but I really really badly want to do so. Any suggestions? For example should I see a physicist and do exercises with him to build my stamina up again? Or is it safe for me to go back to footy practice and do some running for example and kick some balls here and there?

Anyone have had experience with pneumathorax recoveries? Just want to do my thing again and not be scared.

Thanks a lot in advance!"
42,Inquiring about ketamine for depression,"Canadian (22m) ~6 ft 135lbs, mixed race (southeast Asian/caucasian). I've suffered lifelong depression. Medication includes cannabis as a sleep aid, I'm on the nicotine patch for smoking and will drink no more than 6 beers over the span of a week.

 I've been diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar although I believe I have severe PTSD and depression (not bipolar). In the past I have been prescribed prozac, sertraline (idk the spelling), Wellbutrin, lamictal, Seroquel, Dexedrine, Ativan, clonazepam, and a few more antidepressants that I cannot remember. None of which have helped - mostly worsened my suffering. Is it possible in Canada to be clinically treated with ketamine and if so, would somebody like me have a chance at trying? My doctors seem stumped and leave me with no other options other than trying Latuda and lithium which I am extremely skeptical about and financially incapable of taking.

If ketamine is an option for treatment does anybody know an estimated cost or have any advice on how to access treatment?"
43,Why do I feel like I am being stereotyped due to trying to refill my controlled substance medication?,"Age:30

Height: 6'0""

Sex:Male

Weight:156

Medications: Clonazepam .5mg daily (for seven years so far) Adderall XR 20MG (clinically diagnosed by Psychologist as ADHD Combined Type.)

&#x200B;

I hope some physicians can chime in and help provide some insight as to what to do and why I feel I am being stereotyped. Let me get this out of the way: I do not have a history of abuse, nor do I abuse my prescription drugs. I'm well aware of the  monitoring programs, and I have consistently visited the same doctor and gotten the medication filled at the same pharmacy.

&#x200B;

My doctor that I had been seeing for management of my clonazepam suddenly retired. I made an appointment to see another physician at the student health center of my university (the first one practiced there until she retired.)  This physician I have never seen before, she informed me she would write my script, but would like psychiatry to handle it afterwards, fine by me, new doctor she hasn't treated me before.

&#x200B;

Psychiatry makes me an appointment with a fellow, scheduling social worker calls a week and a half later (so I am down 1 1/2 weeks of my medication at this point.) saying they had to cancel appt, and she talked to the psychiatrist I used there previously (I did not have a good patient relationship with him, I just did not feel comfortable with him, so I started seeing the doctor that had managed my meds before she retired.)  He recommended off campus psychiatry. I requested another psychiatrist, because the school has more than one. She said first step is to talk to him, so I said okay, and she said he would contact me.

&#x200B;

Fast forward another week, I hear nothing. I attempt to contact the replacement doctor I saw because my original physician at student health retired. This new doctor, has now left. I leave a message for the medical director about the situation. I get a secure message saying I need to reach out to my ""new provider"" as student health can't manage my medication (which is strange, because my original physician was doing it just fine.)

&#x200B;

I write back, informing I have no provider, and was told to seek off campus psychiatry, and every attempt I had made I was told I'd be considered a new patient, and the wait time is significantly longer than medicine I have left, and I do not want to go through benzodiazepine withdrawal due to the dangers involved.

&#x200B;

Physician calls me back, and essentially says none of the doctors feel ""comfortable"" writing for it, recommended I call a Crisis line or go to the Emergency Department. I have no idea why she suggested a crisis line? Last I checked, they do not help with medication management, that is for individuals in severe mental crisis. I explained to her (which I felt like I shouldn't have to do) that I am not in mental crisis, and that with my medication being a controlled substance, myself walking into the Emergency Department and asking for a prescription of clonazepam is, blatantly, going to look like I'm an addict that is pill seeking. They are going to want to ask why I don't just get it where I've been getting it before.

&#x200B;

I'm aware prescription monitoring programs exist. I have zero discrepancies with my medications, like I stated above. In fact, my last physician even went over the whole system with me and showed me how it worked. I'd rather not waste an attending physicians time in the emergency department, as well as pay hundreds of dollars, the idea of that just seems like a very inefficient way to go about things.  When I asked the medical director what do I do about the side effects of abrupt benzodiazepine discontinuation, she didn't have an answer for me.  I honestly couldn't believe a physician could say that. She offered to try calling and speaking to the scheduling person upstairs in psychiatry, but I have no idea what that will yield, hopefully a physician willing to continue my medication management that I have been on for years.  I cannot afford to be without these medications, and I feel that by knowing the drug class, etc, that I'm being stereotyped as a result of it.  I research everything that is prescribed to me. I honestly cannot see why they will not even write me a temporary supply of my medication until I can get either with a psychiatrist upstairs, or find one off site.

&#x200B;

So, in closing, What would you, medical professionals recommend? I've been told by my original prescribing physician that for as long as I have been on it do not discontinue abruptly (she actually mentioned a patient that died from convulsions when she was a medical school student as a result of it, which scared me.)

&#x200B;

I am at a loss as to what to do, I feel any physician I would reach out to would wonder why I am not staying with where I have been for years (which, I would, if they would write for it.)

&#x200B;

Edit: I know this is completely irrelevant, but they would still write for my Adderall, but not my clonazepam...To me that seems backwards, because of how dangerous benzodiazepine discontinuation is, but I'm not a physician."
44,17M - unable to taste,"Hello, so for some reason I’m unable to taste anything. I am not sick with a cold or anything, but have a canker sore on my gum.

45,My lower back suddenly gave out on Sunday and I've been in extreme pain since. Think it's a herniated disc. What do I do?,"I'm 24, Female, 5'9, 140lbs, non-smoker, athletic (I surf 4-5 times per week and try to do 20 mins of basic stretching every other day), with no serious health conditions. 

On Sunday morning I was standing in my backyard pouring out a tub of water (maybe 5-6 kilos?), which I've done a million times before. Note I hadn't done any stretches or exercising or anything unusual that morning. I was vaguely straddling a puddle of water, with my right leg slightly behind me and my arms/tub extended in front of me as I reached to pour the water into a pot, when all of a sudden I was hit with this insane pain in my lower back which made me almost fall down and immediately dropped the tub of water. 

I can only describe the pain as a sudden, immense shooting pain in my lower right back, and the sensation felt like something in my lower back slipped/gave way. It was like I lost all control of the right side of my body.

It's now Tuesday morning. The pain is significantly worse in the mornings - so bad it makes it difficult to sit down, to stand up (I need to basically pull myself up or put full weight on my left thigh to push myself up), to touch my chin to my chest, to sit still in certain positions. My back is cracking quite a bit as well and I can feel a kind of clicking sensation when I walk. The pain itself is radiating constantly, but when I do something to aggravate it, it feels like sharp, sudden, twinging waves of concentrated pain from my lower right back.

In the late afternoon / evening there is noticeably more relief. I even managed to go for a small walk yesterday afternoon and felt sore but generally ok / better than I expected. But I woke up this morning already with pain even though I hadn't even gotten out of bed yet, and it started all over again (seriously painful to just sit down, reach forward, bend forward, etc).

During the day my main relief is laying in bed on my back (my legs have to be positioned carefully so as to not aggravate it), and ice on the lower right side of my back. Or when I'm sitting on the toilet, I can push past a certain point where I can bend forward and sort of stretch my spine in a curve (as if I'm pulling my chin toward my knees), and that feels good / ok.

Here's the problem: I'd already have gone to the doctor if I could, but I live in a remote town in a developing country with no doctors or hospitals around. If this is really serious I'll have to pay out of pocket $500 for a flight to another country where there's legitimate hospitals & doctors. But I don't know how serious this is.

Any insight or advice would be much appreciated. Should I wait it out? Does this sound like anything familiar? Is there anything I can do to help this injury, whatever it is, or do I definitely need to see a medical professional?"

I had posted something similar here the other day, but deleted it, and now have a different thought.

For some time now, occasionally, I would notice an odd floating 'object 'in my stool. Just some roundish ball-like figure. As far as I know, I would only notice this when I had an upset stomach (loose stool) (perhaps because it's able to break away easily). It definitely isn't feces itself, which is why it stands out to me when I do see it. I said fuck it and got some gloves and what not to check it out. It's like it's covered by a thin layer of (gross) mucus or something. However, I poked it with a q-tip (lmao), and I noticed the insides actually were a powder white substance, much like my medication inside the capsule. It's seriously exactly the same, so strange.

48,My mom was diagnosed with meningioma and ventricular subependymoma.Need advice,"Hello, sorry for any mistakes. So my mother did go to the doctor for cervical spondylosis but the MRI showed these as benign tumors. The doctor said she needed also a CT scan to verify these are indeed benign and said it will not require a surgery. My mom is 58 years old and the recovery for a brain surgery will be slower, but if this will help her get rid of the head aches I think it's the better choice. I alse heard about the radio surgery for these types of cases, can it be used without partial removal of the tumor? How dangerous are these types of tumors?

Seasonal things that generally cause itchy eyes and runny nose

I have been breaking out in hives almost every night for about 5-6 weeks. I have eliminated every product I use, as well as my husband’s products, rewashed our laundry several times, our sofa covers, everything. We’ve reverted back to old things we used for several years. I’ve eaten an incredibly bland diet. I have checked my house for bugs of any kind every day for weeks. I simply cannot figure out what is causing this. It seems to be more common at night, around the same time, but has happened during the day as well. 

Now I’m noticing that if I pinch my skin anywhere on my body I develop an itchy hive looking spot. It looks just like a mosquito bite (image of pinched leg shown in link, first two images) I have also included some [images](https://imgur.com/gallery/lGtYxkb) of my leg broken out in hives one night randomly. These spread so quickly and looked odd to me so I went to the ER. They said they couldn’t figure it out, and since I didn’t have any lesions or respiratory problems it was probably fine and that I could just take some Benadryl. The skin pinching thing is very odd to me, I have never experienced this. I have rarely broken out in hives in the past, and never to this extent. I have 2 tattoos on my body, if this matters. One of them has been affected by hives twice since this started, but it isn’t a common occurrence. 

What tests do I need to ask for? What do I look for? Is this a sign of something more serious? I’m becoming more alarmed as time goes on. Rewashing everything I own in fragrance free detergent seemed to lessen the severity of the hives, but not the frequency. Nothing I was using before eliminating things is new to me. However, I have just moved from NY to NC. I’m not sure if this is relevant, but I experienced hemorrhoids for the first time in my life right before this started, and they have been gone since. I believe they were hemorrhoids because I had some pain and bright red blood in my stool, and then a lump around my anus, but they have since gone away. I attributed this to stress."

52,"Can retinal detachment occur for no reason, or does this sound like something else?","20F

Starting a few days ago, I began experiencing: Shadows in the form of horizontal bands traveling up or down the peripheral vision of one eye, floaters, bright spots in vision, and random blurry points in the center of one eye's vision. These usually occur over five times a day, and happen especially when I'm lying down or sitting in bed. It is dramatic enough that I noticed immediately the day it started, but it's not so dramatic it affects my life in any way.

I thought it would just go away on its own, but it has been persistent and the frequency of these hallucinations hasn't gone down. From my searching, what seems most likely to me is retinal detachment, and I have an eye doctor appointment in about a week to see if this is the case. However, I have no idea why this would be happening and from my medical history it seems extremely unlikely.

I wear glasses, like half the people in my family, but none of my extended relatives have ever experienced retinal detachment, I am very young and generally healthy, I have never had any eye surgery or injury, and I can't recall any event that could have triggered this. As far as I know, retinal detachment isn't that common, either, so it seems really unlikely it would be happening to me.

The only two possible causes I can think of are that I'm under a very intense amount of stress and that my neck got stuck a couple days ago when I turned my head and it hurt so bad I couldn't move for a few seconds. However, that happened after it started so I don't think it's related at all. I also woke up with random red circles around my eyes close to the day it started, but I don't know if that's connected and I think it's just from stress/crying. I'm very confused, to sum it up.

Is it possible I could actually be experiencing retinal detachment? Do these symptoms sound like anything else? Sorry, I know this is probably confusing, but I'm stressed about this and I don't know what else to do until I wait for my appointment. Thanks for the help."

Okay. I'm a (supposedly) healthy 16 year old. I workout at the gym a few days a week for about an hour and half, and eat healthy. Yesterday I noticed that I have a bit of fat on me belly, so I decided to fast the day after (today), in addition to going to the gym to burn as much as I can. As I was in my Biology class, however, I noticed a bit of pain on the right side of my mouth, specifically where the lips meet. I thought it was just a small cut, so I ignored it. However, today, as I was getting ready to go sleep, I looked in the mirror one last time and saw this strange, bubbly, reddish sore in the area that was aching earlier. I'm a virgin, never kissed anyone besides my parents, sisters, uncles and aunts (forehead, hands, and cheeks. Never anywhere else), and none of us have any STDs to my knowledge. However, when I searched on google, nearly every result pointed to Herpes, and I'm freaking out. I don't know if it's just Google being google or if I actually contracted something.

55,Weird head pains?,"Hey 20M here, ive been having some issues with head and neck pain for a bit that im just driving myself crazy googling what they might be.

Month or so ago i got a shitty habbit for a week and a bit of having the need to turn and manipulate my neck cuz it just felt like somethings out of place and ended up making things pretty sore and even worse. From this, but even before this, ive been having weird head pains like stabbing pains and dull aches and pain in the back of my head when bending over or excerting myself sometimes. Also prone to migraines, just got 2 in a row a couple days ago, and some other weird head pains, but some are weirder than others and ive been able to tell what kind of pains the other ones are.

Another thing that i dont know what to make of it that happened just last night. Think i was/still am sti recovering from the migraines, but i was laying in bed and was feeling some light ache in the middle of my head a few inches above my right temple and idk why but i thought to sort of FEEL like i was getting my body to like, send help to that area (no judging, people do things late at night😅) and its not like i flexed anything or actually did anything, i just thought it, but literally 2 secs later i get some weird stabbing pain in that area. Lasted not even a second, but it was there and it made me flinch and it was weird. Now im all paranoid if its a tumor or unburst aneurysm or something, and wondering if it can legit just be how concentrated my worrying is, if you can make yourself feel pain just by thinking you will

Just alot of weird things going on and was wondering if someone has any input as to why. Ik some aching in the head if its a sort of pressure around the head can be from anxiety but idk about the others. I know this is a long post but any help would be appreciated. Thanks a ton"

Mid 2018- laparoscopy to remove dermoid cyst

Dec 2018-post m/C u/s detects suspected polyp. Told to monitor. Monitored for 5-6months. Over this time I experienced 1+week of spotting each month before period arrived.

July 2019- polyp removed. Benign. 

Since July I'm still experiencing atleast a week of spotting before my period. The gyno said to go on progesterone only pill for a few months to see if it fixes it. It has not. What the hell is going on with my body. I'm sick of bleeding for half a month but also want to fix the cause and not just treat the symptoms (I've been recommended b/C shot to eradicate periods).

However over the past 2 weeks i have noticed a sharp pain in that area whenever i go out and drink on an empty stomach which i usually do, and when i excercise.

I use estrogen patches for hormone replacement therapy (just estrogen, no progesterone).  I would like to wean myself off of HRT, or at least find the minimum dose that will alleviate my symptoms. 

I want to do this by cutting pieces off of the patches to reduce the dose.  For example, I’d cut about 10% off of each patch I use in the next month.  If that goes OK then in two months, I’d cut 20% off, etc. 

These patches are sold in little air-tight foil pouches.  I would cut the patches immediately after removing them from the pouch, just before I apply them to my skin. But I don’t want to throw away the cut pieces unless I must.  I would like to store them in a sealed bag and use them eventually – yes, I’m frugal!

My question is, how does air affect these patches?  Would refrigerating them help?

I asked my doc and he wasn't sure.

65,M25 has sores on his feet that will not heal,"My boyfriend is M25, 5'11"", 280 lbs. He has a sedentary lifestyle at home but at work he's on his feet all day (food service). His diet consists of fast food, soda, and candy.

He has suffered from psoriasis for almost two years and is currently receiving treatment in the form of monthly shots. His psoriasis is clear, we don't believe the sores are related. He also sleeps excessively and snores very loudly, possibly because of his weight. This has not been checked by a doctor.

He has had sores on his feet for several weeks, maybe a few months at this point. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/6hk2wdy.jpg) is a picture.

He initially went to CareNow and they diagnosed him with athlete's foot. They gave him an oral antibiotic and prescription strength fungal cream. That was a while ago and it never got better. He just lost his second job so he can't afford to go back. He's been using over the counter fungal cream since the prescription ran out but the sores are still the same, possibly worse.

I was worried about diabetes due to his diet and weight so I asked him to get an A1C test. The test didn't show any signs of diabetes or pre-diabetes, just a couple concerning spikes over the past 6 months.

Does this still sound like athlete's foot that needs stronger treatment? Or something else?"

68,16M Nephew recently kinshipped into Grandmas house. He has serious mental health issues they are unwilling to address but I want to help. Please advise.,"My nephew has had a pretty unfortunate history that includes neglect and abuse. I have been tactfully instrumental in getting him moved in with his grand parents and getting him the support he needs.

In doing so, he has told me he hears constant voices and they tell him to do things. When he describes them, they tell him to do violent things. 

He says they get louder the more stressed out he gets. He has a history of cutting and says that on the occasions he has cut, the voices kind of take over and he loses touch with reality and comes back to with cuts on his wrist and blood everywhere. 

He has said he has been hospitalized for it and diagnosed by two different doctors with ""schizophrenia minora"" if I remember correctly. 

Where do I take him to get a complete and accurate diagnosis? He tells me his symptoms are better since moving and his depression and suicide issues are not even a problem any more but his voices are still there and may be getting worse. 

He does not feel comfortable talking to his grandparents who he lives with about this issue at all and every time I have tried to talk to them about it they say they think he is a liar and making it up. So they have their heads in the sand but I want to help him since he feels comfortable with me enough to talk about it.

I was having diarrhea at least 10 and sometimes 20 or more times a day for 5 days, accompanied with stomach cramps and muscular pain when I was on the toilet. Three days ago it stopped, but I haven't had a single bowel movment since. I've lost 5lbs in just the last 3 days (I'm assuming it's not normal to lost weight while constipated?).

Eating and drinking and peeing are normal, some abdominal discomfort and bloating but no pain. I just haven't pooped in 3 days.

It's kind of freaking me out that I keep eating and drinking a normal amount, not pooping, and losing weight...

Starting yesterday, I have tried: fiber supplements, stool softener, stimulant laxative, enema. No luck."
74,"Episodes similar to sleep paralysis, but not quite","15M, 5'10, 59 kg

On 3 occasions from the age of 11-13, I experienced intense panic attacks in the middle of the night. From my brief research, they seem to be similar to many sleep related/anxiety conditions, however it didn't quite fit in to any one category. They involved waking up at night for no apparent reason, followed by intense fear. The fear seemed like it was even worse than if I were about to die. There was a source of the fear (in my head at least) but it was often fuzzy, nonsensical, and not something really worth being afraid of. At first it was paralysing, but after a while (maybe 1 minute, maybe 10?) it would ease off. Although it did ease, I was still in a state of major anxiety, and it only eased enough for me to move around. The first time this happened I then proceeded to walk around the house in panic, maybe even outside and to the shed for no apparent reason. Several times, the fear would increase, leaving me basically in a crying mess on the ground, before slightly easing off. I believe the whole event lasted about half an hour, however I can't really be sure. The same thing happened twice more, however the last time it only lasted maybe 5-10 minutes. Through the event my senses worked fine (most things were clear) but i felt like i was still dreaming, as I couldn't think the way I normally did (though this may just be from the anxiety).

At this time I wasn't on any medication, I had a fairly consistent sleep schedule, and had no traumatic events in my past. There was nothing different happening in my life leading up to the events. I haven't been diagnosed with any mental conditions, however I haven't really talked to any experts about what happened. Considering I haven't had any episodes for 2-3 years I don't think it will happen again, but I'm still curious about it.

Any information/advice is appreciated! thanks"
75,Dull pain when breathing in deep and high heartbeat after running short distances. Medical issue or just fat?,"14M 120lbs. For as long as I can remember I've had this weird, dull pain in my chest when I breathe in deep. It isnt really painful but it is annoying and is worse with very hot or cold air. I've asked some other people and the answers range from walking pneumonia to asthma to just out of shape. Another possibly related issue is when running. I can't run a short distance or go up stairs without feeling my heart beating through my head. If I run for a long time or too fast I get this bad pain under my right rib area. Not unlike a ""side stitch"" but more severe and goes away only after getting water. My mom wants me to go to doctor but I think I'm fine. Any answers are greatly appreciated!"

For almost an entire year,  I’ve been feeling like I have constantly had a UTI. Slight burning sensation while I urinate, difficulty getting it all out, urinating more than normal throughout the day etc. Until now I’ve just been going back and forth and back and forth to my PCP and a urologist. A couple of times they said it was ureaplasma. This whole time I’ve had the same sexual partner \[F\], and she’s not been having symptoms. At one time my PCP mentioned a mental condition that feels like you constantly have to urinate without actually having to. I can't really afford visits back and forth to the doctor because I don't have insurance and lab bills get really expensive. Neither my PCP or the urologist Ive been to has seemed very concerned that it's gone on this long. At this point I'm thinking it may be a symptom of anxiety or something. Should I just keep setting up appointments with a urologist? Or should I just go back to a psychiatrist and tell them about this stuff? I have already been to plenty and can't really particularly keep paying off bills from a psychiatrist or counselor and these symptoms make me pretty uncomfortable, especially when I'm at work where I get scolded by my boss for having too many bathroom trips."

78,ear infection misdiagnosis?,"hi! I'm 24f, 110lbs. - I started to get what I thought was an ear infection at the end of August. Thought it would go away on it's own but it seemed to get worse - went to the doctor on Sept. 5th and my primary said it was fine and it would go away (he drained my ears although at the time it was only my left ear that was the issue). He also suggested diluting rubbing alcohol and putting a few drops into my ears to dry them up to stop the leaking. Worked temporarily. 

Fast forward to a week ago I went to an ENT, explained the frequent pain and how my ears leak (usually by night this is heightened which SUCKS). She then drains my ears and says it has to do with my sinuses and recommended I take allergy medication (Claritin). Well I haven't, and I have been using the ear drops I was prescribed, but I feel as though they're not doing much. The insides of my ears are itchy and hurt and I really can't do anything about it. 

I shouldn't have waited to long to get checked out. I have temporarily lost some hearing which my ENT doctor said should go back to normal once the infection goes away. I don't know what to do other than just keep using these ear drops and hope for the best, but it sucks not being able to really hear as well as have a hard time going to sleep. Any help, helps.

79,29/F ankle still hurts a month after a minor crash on a kid’s Segway,"Basically just wondering if I need to go to a doctor or get X-rays? I’m not one to go to the doctor, usually if I wait an injury out it just goes away. I was (drunk) riding my friend’s kid’s Segway thing and went to jump a curb and hit it wrong, ended up falling and the Segway auto ran itself over my ankle. I skinned the left one on the outside, just got a scab and it was fine. But my right ankle (the one that got ran over) swelled at the time and was a bit tender to walk on but not overly painful. Now, a month later, no pain at all walking or moving it around, and no longer swollen, but if I touch it on the inside it hurts a surprising amount. It almost feels as if something is moving around under the skin but could just be tendons. Only hurts if I touch it. Would you recommend waiting it out or going to the doctor? Thanks in advance!

80,Should I go to the ER for chronic diarrhea?,"Age: 22

Sex: female

Height: 5' 5""

Weight: 125lbs

Duration of complaint: it's been happening for years, feeling WAY worse lately

Medication: I take probiotics, imodium, and peptol bismol 

Diagnoses: IBS (hear me out please)

Symptoms: longterm and DAILY diarrhea, DAILY nausea,  DAILY dizziness, DAILY dehydration, DAILY confusion, DAILY gas, DAILY weakness, DAILY stomach pain. Stomach flu and parasitic infection has been ruled out.

I've been having daily diarrhea for a while now. My doctor doesnt seem to take me seriously or believe me. She said I wouldnt be even able to make it out of the house if it were as bad as I mentioned. I can see why she thinks I sound like I'm exaggerating because having diarrhea this often would cause weight loss, nutrient deficiencies and much more. But Im telling it how it is. I feel absolutely awful. That was about two years ago when I saw a doctor and got the IBS diagnosis and I feel way worse. I've have very loose stools and occasionally tarry, slightly firmer stools on a rare day. I feel constantly dehydrated and I have this feeling everyday that I am very hungover. Even though I dont drink alcohol. I feel so dizzy it's even difficult to write this as I'm laying down. It's hard to socialize or even walk. I wanna put a big emphasis of the dizziness symptom. It's pretty rough and I feels exactly like a hangover mixed with weakness and dizziness. I do drink lots of water. Also I get nauseous mostly in the mornings and I have very little appetite throughout the day. I'm having a very hard time excepting the diagnosis for IBS. I find it hard to believe my body is doing this to itself because of a disease that is not yet well understood. It's hard to go to social events or do anything. I feel very weak and work is a daily struggle. I feel like something else could be happening. I've tried probiotics, eliminating certain foods, eating healthy is something I always do. I got tested for lactose intolerance which came out positive so I avoid dairy with no relief. No celiac disease, blood work seems okay yet that was done a while back. I take vitamins daily as well. I tried researching ways to get better but everybody makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. Like it's my fault that I suffer from these symptoms.  Everyone always jumps to a stomach flu or something. Nobody seems to believe when I say daily and longterm. It's also embarrassing so I have to make up excuses to avoid hanging out with people. I makes me frustrated. I really want to feel better and live a normal life. I dont see how I can live the rest of my life like this.  It's just awful. Question is should I go to the ER? I feel terrible and I'm wondering if they would be more proactive with a diagnosis. Would they take me seriously? I tend to be very introverted and non assertive. I tend to be talked over and the appointments are always rushed so they never hear me out. I'm honestly so afraid of getting the IBS diagnosis again. I'd rather die than feel like this for the rest of my life."

In 2015 I developed pain in my thoracic spine that was severe when doing high impact exercise and was only relieved a little by self adjustments. Fast forward to 2016 and it got so severe and i developed winging of my left scapula. I withdrew from college lacrosse and was sent around from specialist to specialist with normal thoracic, cervical and shoulder MRIs along with normal EMG. I was later referred to another physician who diagnosed me with scapula muscle detachment and I had reattachemnt surgery for my left side in January 2017. This diagnosis was made despite normal MRI off of tests based on strength, wall push up, etc. I felt better for about 5 months after surgery  but again now am back where I started.  Not only do I have severe thoracic spine pain but I had also developed a lateral curve in my thoracic spine that wasn’t there years ago. I was diagnosed with hEDS during this time. I also now have nerve like burning pain across the top of my left shoulder, worse where my shoulder and neck meet and neck pain as well. I have been in PT for years with no improvement. Grade 1 spondylithesis was seen at c5 in a flexion extension X-ray but i was told this may only explain the development of the nerve pain across my shoulder and having nothing to do with the pain in my mid back.

83,[28F] Vision loss in one eye near menstruation,"Hi! I'm 28yo, female, Asian, 1.63m and 70 kg (154 lbs). I don't take any medications and does not have any known illness. I just stopped smoking and drinking a month ago. English is not my first language, I'm sorry if it's not grammatically correct.

So, there have already been three consecutive episodes (3 months) where I lost my vision in my left eye. It gradually goes black (sometimes gray) until I lost about 95% of my left eye's vision. I gain back my vision after a minute or so. And on those three episodes, I am not doing any strenuous activity, no headaches or any pain felt before and after.

I went to my opthalmologist the first time it occured, the diagnosis was Amaurosis Fugax. Eye tests came out good. My eyes are good except only for a slight astigmatism but I don't need any glasses for it and it doesn't bother me at all. So my doctor told me to come back if it happens again. 

But I didn't went back yet because I think it isn't a cause of alarm. It worried me though after the third episode, so here I am asking if it should be a cause of alarm, and if I should do another test, or what specific doctor should I go to.

BTW, every time it happens, I get unusually sleepy and tired the day before. Also, it happens days before my menstruation. So, I'm thinking it might be a hormonal thing.

II went through a benzo withdrawal years ago and battled clostridium difficile until this past September. Don’t know if they play a role. C diff seems to have cleared up besides greasy stool. I went in for the fatigue, burning around my mouth, and burning around my rectum. It started while on oral vancomycin. 

Below is a link to my bloodwork but some samples were hemotyzed so I don’t know how accurate they are. I’m waiting for the re-draw results but low sodium, high potassium, and bilateral variococeles on my testicles have me worried about my kidneys. Especially since I frequently wake up feeling dehydrated despite by consuming normal amounts of water. 

The issues that popped up are:

* High immature granulocyte automated 3.6% on scale of 0 -  1.0
* High MCHC 35.9 on scale of 30.4 - 34.8
* Low sodium of 131 on scale of 135 - 145
* Potassium 10+ ( says hemolyzed and asks for re-draw)

200mg Wellbutrin per day. Phentermine daily (unsure of dosage)

On Wednesday my Wife woke up feeling very nauseous, fatigued, and dizzy (she said when she moves her head her vision feels like it’s lagging behind. It’s the only way she’s been able to describe it). She made herself vomit thinking it would make her feel better but it didn’t. She went to the Doctor to get an excuse note for work.

She asked if this could be the result of upping her Wellbutrin dosage about 6 days prior (from 300mg a day to 400mg) and get said that was unlikely. He said it was likely viral and wrote her a script for Zofran. This didn’t seem like any stomach virus we’d ever seen or experienced. She felt lousy but was still able to function, unlike whenever she’s had a stomach virus where she’d be asleep if she wasn’t vomiting. Over the last several days, she’s had these symptoms on and off with little appetite. The zofran isn’t helping. 

She went back to the doctor today and he still seemed unconvinced it had to do with the increased Wellbutrin dosage but decreased it to 200mg per day. He said it may have to do with the constipation she’s been experiencing from the Phentermine and prescribed her an enema which hasn’t seemed to help her symptoms. She’s in the military so she’s checked very regularly in regards to her health. The only thing that has been different in the last month or so is her Wellbutrin dosage. 

The only other thing I can think of is that this is anxiety or stress related. She lost her mom very unexpectedly in April, we then lost another relative very unexpectedly shortly after, she then went away for training for 3 weeks and then we moved halfway across the country. This is the reason for the Wellbutrin in the first place.

Does anyone have any idea as to what would cause her to feel this way?"
88,Sliced off fingertip. How to best encourage regrowth?,"Hi AskDocs! I shaved off  a 1/8 inch thick, \~1 square cm surface area slice from the fleshy pad of my middle finger when slicing potatoes with a mandolin. The slice was not down to the muscle, but completely through the dermis to the point where you could see some fat. I am an amateur pianist, so I want to do everything possible to make sure that the wound heals completely, and furthermore that the pad grows back to the greatest extent possible (never fear, I have some left-hand-only repertoire to work on until then!). The PA at urgent care sort of casually said that it would never really grow back. Is that true? Is there a way to encourage the regrowth of the flesh beyond just proper wound care? Do there exist topical anabolics for this kind of thing?

Im pale as casper on my right hand but have a faint green tint on my left. When I looked it up it said that IV bruises generally go away after 2 weeks. I'm no mathematician but its been like double that. Awfully odd if I do say so myself. 🤔 

It doesnt really hurt anymore but it does feel weird when I mess or poke at it, but that could just be my imagination.

Also my left vein (the one that got the IV) is bulging out more than my other vein. So that's cool too.."
90,Will sleeping with O2 at altitude (for anxiety/recovery) cause me to lose acclimatization? (24M),"Hey all,

I live in Breckenridge, CO at nearly 3,000m/10,000ft - and have for the past 18 months. I recently acquired an O2 concentrator that I would like to sleep with, but am concerned that I will lose my acclimatization. 

I’m a big fan of outdoor activities like mountain biking, climbing, and hiking and would hate to lose my ability to do those things well. 

My main reason for trying the O2 concentrator is to improve quality of sleep and to see if it helps with my diagnosed anxiety disorders and associated muscle pains. My sleep quality is currently atrocious and has been for some time. I’m giving this a shot because many recent studies point to living at high altitudes as potentially major risk factors for developing mental disorders.

95,[30F] Diuretics and UTIs,"White, 5'6, 180 pounds. I was diagnosed with primary hypertension a month ago after a few elevated readings (last office reading: 120/91). My NP wants to put me on HCTZ. My issue is that I have had several (eight) UTIs in the past six months, two of which went to my kidneys, and all of which required antibiotics. I know that they're unlikely related to the rise in BP, but one doctor did note that I was showing signs of dehydration in my urine, which they thought was likely a factor for the UTIs (that I don't drink enough water, although I generally get over 2L per day). I'm worried that the diuretics will damage my kidneys further. My NP pretty much laughed at my theory, but I'd appreciate getting to the bottom of my UTI problem before I start the HCTZ. FWIW, my BP readings at home are almost normal on days I exercise, which are most days, and I'm keeping an eye on it. Is it worth it to go to another provider and get a second opinion?

96,"Tore my calf muscle, it felt better now but 6 weeks later is is swollen again! :-(","Female, 37

I tore my calf while exercising about 6 weeks ago. I didn’t get it seen by anyone, but talked to a doctor over email.

It was pretty badly bruised.  I walked carefully for about a week. Then slowly got back into exercising, being careful with that leg.  It was swollen for weeks but slowly went down.

Then the last few days I have been exercising more vigorously, including doing some jump roping which I had avoided before. It seemed ok. Then today I walked about 2 miles, fairly quickly, after already going to an hr long exercise class.  

Now the leg is a little bit achy in one spot where I feel tightness when I palpate, almost as though there is a bit of a knot in the muscle. The calf is also visibly swollen again. :-(

Questions: did I re-injure something? What should I do? Do I need to go actually see a doctor?  I googled and of course turned up a cancer forum in the replies... is there some chance the muscle tore because I had some growth in my calf and I need to get an MRI?  

And, lastly, I really really don’t want to stop exercising.  I feel crappy when I do.  How do I keep doing my current workouts without hurting my leg?

The pain made it difficult to breath deeply, but I wasnt in danger of passing out. That was an hour ago. Just now I experimenced a second severe bout of pain on my right ribs just below my breast for roughly 2 minutes while I was laying in my bed and turned over. After probing, the part of the ribs there near my sternum are tender. I've had rib pains since about two years ago, locations ranging from upper sternum to lower left and right sides, but it seems to have become more common recently. It also might be helpful to note that I was in a 25 mph motorcycle accident 4 weeks ago that broke my finger. It was a standing, head on accident, so I'm afraid my chest might have hit the dash/handlebars and accelerated the pain. I didn't notice this increase until 2 days ago though.

104,Are cold sores contagious days before a blister?,"Female, 19, 5’3, 112lbs, white, possibly have cold sore, 2 hours ago, no medical conditions, no medications, but I recently went off of birth control, smoke weed, no smoking cigarettes, no drinking 

Yesterday I noticed a dark area on my moms lower lip not a bump it just looked dark and I said are you getting a cold sore? And she told me no. Then today I see she has a cold sore. & I just noticed when I was rubbing my lips together I feel 4 tiny bumps I can only see them in certain light and when I lick it it tastes like a metal a little. 
We don’t ever kiss each other on the cheek or lips or use any of the same utensils, just side one armed hugs. But like 2 or 3 days ago she kissed my cheek near my ear, and I don’t know if maybe she didn’t feel the early signs of it and maybe she could have transferred it to me because I read it can take a couple days from when a blister first appears but it can still be contagious.


To sum up it up can I get a cold sore before there was any blister or symptoms (from what she said) and from a kiss on the cheek? She kissed my cheek 2 or 3 days before I saw the dark area on her lip and the next day (today) she got a cold sore."
105,Any advice from a Neurologist or Radiologist on my test results?,"-	Male
-	29
-	USA

Before I get started, I have already spoken to my Neurologist about the imaging results and he said that everything is “unremarkable “ and I have no need to be concerned...but he cannot answer why the reports are so different. I thought I’d ask this subreddit if anyone can explain why my reports would be so different or missing certain results on the same exact tests.

I’ve had three MRAs of my Head (without contrast) over the last couple of years and the results (to me) are concerning. 

-	[First MRA](https://i.imgur.com/OCIGhYl.jpg) (looks normal - [addendum](https://i.imgur.com/TqjXgTM.jpg) found absent/hypoplastic posterior communicating arteries) 
-	[Second MRA](https://i.imgur.com/heRkSh2.jpg) (this one found the absent/hypoplastic posterior communicating arteries - which led to the addendum above)
-	[Third MRA](https://i.imgur.com/SzhfJg3.jpg) (this one confirms absent/hypoplastic posterior communicating arteries - but also says posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are not included)

1) Is there a reason that on the first scan the radiologist missed the posterior communicating arteries being absent and were only found on the second scan when that doctor called for an addendum on the first to confirm? Is it serious that I’m missing the posterior communicating arteries bilaterally?

2) Is there a reason the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are seen on the first exam, not mentioned on the second exam, and called out as not included on the third exam. Am I also missing those or where they not imaged due the way the exam was done?

This imaging place is rated very highly and has many offices in my city...I’m just concerned that all the reports are different and missing stuff, yet the outcome is always Unremarkable/Normal. Again, I’m very happy everything seems to be normal, but I wonder why the reports are missing information or different every time.

Also, how can I be missing stuff and it’s unremarkable? Wouldn’t I be at risk of something happening in the future?"
106,Prematurely Ejaculating at 20," Hi, Im 20 years old and I've started having sex frequently, by my standards anyway (like once or twice a week).

Which is great, but the problem is I'm cumming far too fast almost all the time, about 1 in 5 times ill last about 10+ minutes which is fine, but the other 4 times I cum in under 20 seconds.

Honestly theirs no 2 ways about it, its fucking embarrassing and ruins every sexual encounter and potential relationship I have.

I've tried a couple of solutions:

1. Extra thick condoms (felt almost nothing but still came in like 20 seconds anyway??).
2. Kegels (Not good for me for several reasons: I feel like an idiot doing them, they don't really seem to work, I'm horrible at keeping up routine, If possible I want this problem solved before the girl I'm currently seeing realises this is a regular issue for me (we've had sex twice and I got lucky and lasted long the first time, the second time however I came in about 5 seconds and just kinda acted surprised and laughed it off, but she was very clearly dissapointed and i can't imagine she'll keep coming back if it happens again) and from what I've heard it takes quite a while for Kegels to make any noticeable difference).
3. Pacing myself, deep breathes, thinking of something else, etc (none of that really works for me, not consistently anyway, and if it does work it usually only delays it like an extra 20 seconds).
4. I've not tried them but numbing creams and pills aren't really an option for me (mostly because most of my sexual encounters aren't planned and I'm not comfortable asking whoever I'm with to give me a minute while i apply cream or take a pill).

A few points that might be relevant

1. I pee frequently and in seemingly random patterns (basically when I was like 9 I started needing to go to the toilet almost all the time, but it randomly fluctuates, like sometimes I can go a whole day peeing only 3-5 times, other times I need to pee about 3-5 times an hour, I went to the doctors a bunch about it when i was younger but every time they told me they couldn't find anything wrong so I just kinda gave up and just live with it) - I get the feeling this could be related due to the fact that it can just go away randomly for a day, much like the premature ejaculation (and it uses largely the same body parts ofc).
2. This happens when i masturbate as well (although not quite as bad i can usually last about a minute or 2 but i think that's mostly because I'm in complete control of the pace, grip, etc).
3. This never used to happen to me, I used to be able to last 10+ minutes consistently, then I had an insanely stressful and difficult 3 months and every time I've had any sexual encounter since, short fuse, but the things that caused the stress in those 3 months really aren't a factor in my life at all anymore and I never think about them either so I can't see how that would be effecting it anymore.
4. I Don't know anyone else my age (or anyone in general) who has this problem.
5. I don't think its just inexperience, because as I say it never used to be a problem.

Basically I have 5 questions:

1. Is it normal for someone my age to experience this? (and i mean actually normal, like does this happen to a lot of 20 year olds)
2. Any ideas why it start happening suddenly?
3. Any ideas why is it happening at all?
4. Is there a quick easily available, temporary fix?
5. Is there a permanent fix?

I’m tired when I wake up and if I don’t have caffeine I need a nap by 1:30pm. If I take a nap I will sleep for at least 3 hours; then that same night I’ll fall asleep as soon as my head hits my pillow.
Also, I’m sick every three to six weeks. 

This has been an ongoing problem my entire life, but it has gotten worse with age. When I sought help in high school (about 15 at the time) my doctor tested my iron levels and white blood count and she told me everything seemed normal.

I’ve changed my diet to see if it helps for what feels like one hundred times. I’ve tried a plant-based diet, keto, paleo, just eating healthier... Nothing seems to improve my condition. But hey, at least I’m losing weight.

Also, I have nummular eczema on my arms (small spots, three or four circles max) and keratosis pilaris... Not that’s helpful information. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Edit: I’ve been taking a daily multivitamin, as well as a biotin, iron and vitamin D supplement for a little less than a month, because when I ask friends and family for advice they suggested I try taking them and seeing how I feel. I am currently battling the flu.

Each time when I’m a little into the third month— maybe 2 months and 2 weeks or so—I start to PMS, spot, and eventually just get my period. I always just stop and take my break week as soon as I realize its starting because that way I can get through it instead of dealing with it while taking the pills only to go on the break week and then get my period again (can that happen?) a couple weeks later. I never make it through 3 full packs. Why does this happen?

Back in 2017 I had started the Depo-Provera shot, I was on it until February of 2019 (This year). I gained quite a bit of weight the first 2-3 months; about 30-50lbs. Other than the weight gain I didn't have any other symptoms, period went away which I loved and I felt pretty much 100% normal other than maybe being a little more emotional. About two years later of being on it I started getting breakthrough bleeding and awful (when I say awful I mean AWFUL) cramps. would wake me up in the middle of the night, almost puked, would cry, just felt absolutely terrible for about 2 weeks until my next shot was due. I decided to get off it in February of this year and would absolutely 100% never ever get back on the depo again. I started the Enskyce Birth control pill about a month right after. Awful reaction to it right off the bat. Horrible hot flashes, nausea, cramping, you name it I had it. I wasn't even on it for a full month before I ended it. I have been off of all birth control since. 

Let me back up a little in about December 2018 or January 2019 I had gone to the doctors for my lymph nodes being extremely swollen in my neck; Long story short they Diagnosed me with hyperthyroidism. They are now saying it was thyroiditis since my levels went out of whack for such a short amount of time and have been normal ever since. My first appointment with my endocrinologist was in February, right before I started the birth control pill and right after I ended the shot. My blood work was awful December-February. I met with the endocrinologist December-July. As SOON as I got off ALL birth control at the end of February my levels started to go back down to normal. My levels Have been NORMAL since May of this year (2019) I even started losing weight in July, No diet or exercise change. I've lost about 23 lbs at this point.

To sum all of that up in a couple of questions, 1. Do y'all think birth control could've been the cause of my thyroid levels going out of whack and putting me in a state of thyroiditis? 2. Would the copper IUD be a good choice for me since it's a non-hormonal birth control? 3. Any of y’all ever been on/currently are on this form of birth control? any pros and cons to it? Would you suggest it to anyone else? 

My biggest concern is gaining weight. Did this form of birth control make any of you gain weight? If so about how much? 

Thank you to anyone who responds to this, I am very very appreciative!! Would help me a ton."

122,Attn Dermatologists: Scalp lesion and shave biopsy questions.,"26F|172cm|65kg|Caucasian|Light Drinker|Smoker|No recreational drugs

Current medications: antihistamines (Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 180 mg 2x daily), colchicine (500 mg 2x daily)

Exisiting medical issues: currently under investigation with immunologist and general physician for inflammation/immune/possible systemic issue with skin and muscular involvement over the last 8-10 months.

**Primary complaint:**

Noticed the below linked lesion last week in hair, which is new sometime within the last 12 months but possibly a smaller time frame. Have a dermatologist appt in December for other skin issues that developed in the last 12 months (hives, purpuric rash on calves, pigmented skin patches, acute onset of approz 20-30 cherry angiomas, skin discolouration, miscellaneous rashes etc) but went into gp for assessment of this one prior as it was different to others. 

He performed a shave biopsy and I received the following biopsy report:

**Diagnostic Summary:** Scalp, shave biopsy - benign intradermal naevus

**Clinical notes:** Histopathology scalp 3cm above left ear.

**Macroscopic:** Labelled 'Scalp'. A 6 x 5 x 1mm shaved skin specimen with smooth cream lesion 3 x 3mm. 1A trisected in total.

**Microscopic:** The specimen comprises a shave of skin showing a benign intradermal naevus. There is no evidence of malignancy. The lesion extends to the deep edge of the shave specimen.

**Questions:**

1. Do intradermal naevus blanch under pressure? (This did prior to biopsy).
2. The biopsy results describe the lesion as a smooth cream lesion, yet when it was still attached to my head it was quite red, do intradermal naevus typically lose their colouring when biopsied?
3. Would a shave biopsy been sufficient in providing enough of a sample to be tested to rule out other possible skin lesions?
4. Should I be seeking a second opinion or second type biopsy? As the shave biopsy did not remove the entire lesion, so there is still some on my scalp if further testing is required. 
5. Does it look like a intradermal naevus? Or is there something else it is more likely to be?

I am not so much concerned that it is malignant, as I am curious that it may be linked with the other symptoms I have been experiencing and if there were specific types of cells or if it were a more specific type of lesion, that it could point my doctors in the direction of helping me attain a diagnosis and treatment, which has so far been very difficult. 

Thank you in advance for any advice, second opinions or assistance that may help me follow up with my doctors!

Duration of complaint: 3.5 days

Location: NY State

Any existing relevant medical issues: Raynaud's syndrome, veinous insufficiency (purple hands and feet), sleep walking (??)

Details:
This is a strange one. 

So, on Saturday I made something with shredded beets. I've never handled raw beets before, but I have eaten them. I used both hands, with my left doing most of the grasping.

I noticed some time after this that my pointer finger on my right hand seemed swollen. If I pressed on the middle ""section"" of the palm side of the finger, it would hurt like a bruise. That was the only symptom.

The next day it was not any better. I usually wake up with slightly swollen hands, like how you wake up with a puffy face, which goes away quickly after getting up. With this additional swelling I could not bend my pointer finger all the way. 

I pressed the rest of the sections of my fingers and my left hand was totally fine, but on the right the middle finger, middle section hurt, and the ring finger, tip section. The middle section did not hurt to press on my ring finger and the top section did not hurt on my middle or pointer. If I got my hands to turn more white, there's red on the affected sections. My pointer finger tip was also purple.

My pointer finger was definitely more swollen than the other two, but they had a little swelling.

My hands and feet are usually red unless I elevate them. So the swollen fingers do not look very different then the others at rest, besides being visibly swollen.

This has stayed the same since then. It hurts to do things that curl my fingers and put pressure on them, like picking up clothes off the ground, or opening the fridge. There is no visible bruising and I had no cuts. It does not hurt to extend them away. My wrist is fine.

They are itchy occasionally, but from the swelling pulling at the skin, not from a rash. I have no rash, boils, anything like that to indicate an allergic reaction.

I took my temperature today, no fever.

Ice, Advil (2 300mg), and elevation all don't seem to do much. For reference, my ankles get a little swollen from the veinous insufficiency (I didn't notice until my doctor pointed it out), and that goes away immediately with elevation.

I get Raynaud's in my fingers sometimes, but they just turn white and numb, they don't swell. They also turn back to normal in a few minutes.

There's a few things I could think could cause this:

1. The beets. Maybe I got contact dermitits? But no rash and nothing on my left hand. I also touched my face when preparing them and have no problems there. I've heard this can last a few weeks.

2. I whacked it sleepwalking. I have a history of doing weird things when asleep, but I've never hurt myself. This seems unlikely as I have no bruising and the back of my hand is not hurting. 

3. One of those scary things Google brings up that seem unlikely.

Any thoughts? I don't want to spend the time and money to go to the doctor if all they're going to say is ""it's the beets wait 2 weeks and ice it"" haha.

I have never had something like this happen before.

I'm don't think it's relevant, but I was born at 24 weeks. No lasting effects."

Hi, so I've had this weird pain right in my shoulder joint, I think it started when I went to go play baseball with a few after a couple of years without being active (this was about three years ago).  So while playing I was throwing the ball to the point where I couldn't do it anymore due to harsh pain in my shoulder joint.  To this day I still get pain in my joint if I move my arm up into the air and behind my body in circular motions, it's not a horrible pain but it does cause discomfort when I do this.  Reason as to why I'm telling you this is because I've being working starting to workout for 3-4 months now and I'm feeling great while doing it, I'm just concerned for this shoulder  should I avoid intensive shoulder workouts?  As well can my shoulder ever recover to normal where I don't feel any discomfort at all?  My shoulders as well as other joints always crack when I do certain motions in my workouts but none of which cause discomfort to any of my joints, the only discomfort I get is in my shoulder joint when I do the circular motion that I explained earlier."

The pain has gotten progressively worse and only occurs in my right lower and bottom teeth. At first I thought it one of my back teeth but as the pain gets worse it feels like it’s spreading. Sometimes the pain is so bad that it feels like it spreads across the right side of my face.

The only thing that gives me relief is ice cold water. I have been drinking it constantly for the past week and it helps but it really is affecting my life. I am now going pee at least 10 + times a day, my urine looks like water.

Medical History: Chrohns Disease

Non Smoker

I have been with my grilfrend for 9 months. We have had unprotected sex multiple times without any problems. 3 months ago we had unprotected sex while she was on her period and immediately after sex I had a stinging sharp pain on the tip of my penis. A day later that pain was replaced with a slight burning sensation and a few days after that my right testical had slight discomfort. I went to urgent care and they took a urine sample and dignosed with epyditimitis. Treated it as an STD with a shot and 2 weeks of Doxycycline. Urine sample come back clean. Symptoms go away. 

Continue having sex with condoms. Things get heated without a condom around and we have unprotected sex a month after treatment. Symtoms come back rapidly the next few days and becomes a lot more painful around a 5 or 6 pain scale. Go back to urgent care again  treated same way. After a week on treatment things seemed to be getting worse pain at 7 or 8. Left testical was starting to hurt now too and even some pain in the shaft of my penis and lower right abdomen. Went into the ER. Had an Ultrasound done and nothing abnormal came up in the tests. 2 days after the ER visit things started improving. Ever since then I still get discomfort in my right testical. Occasionally a burning sensation when urinating. Sometimes there is no pain or symptoms but I also have just gotten used to it at this point. 

I do not have a PCP and have been trying to get set up with one for the last month. 

I am uncircumcised. 

My GF did tell me she masturbated with a banana wrapped in saran wrap and used coconut oil as lubricant before all this started to happen. 

It seems pretty clear to me this is some sort of bacterial infection. My concern is that the 2nd round doxycycline was not fully effective. 

Any help or guidance would be very much appreciated."

I’m scheduled for hip arthroscopy next week (labral repair, femoroplasty, acetabular rim trim, microfracture & capsular closure). Unfortunately, I seem to have picked up a cold over the weekend. The symptoms are relatively mild (dry cough, scratchy throat [probably just post nasal drip & irritation from coughing], slightly runny nose but seems to be clearing up, mild sinus congestion). In my past experiences with other (unrelated) surgeries, they seem to prefer patients with asthma to not have any cold symptoms at least a week prior to going under general anesthesia. I don’t know if that info is outdated. My asthma is also relatively mild & well controlled by my inhaler. What are the odds they’ll cancel my surgery over this? I already have a CPM machine getting delivered to my house later this week for post-op care covered by insurance, I feel like this cold might mess up everything."
130,What does “moderate atheromatous calcifications” in peritoneal cavity mean? (CT report),"F, 27, 5’3, 180 lbs

I had a full neck, chest, abdominal and pelvic ct recently because my hematologist suspected either lymphoma or CLL, so they wanted to rule out lymphoma first. Everything was noted as either normal or unremarkable, except that there are “moderate atheromatous calcifications without evidence of aneurysmal dilation of the aorta” in peritoneal cavity. I don’t understand what this means or how it happened. I also am unclear if this could have anything to do with the lymphoma they were looking for? The only note about my lymph nodes was that there were some cervical lymph nodes present that were “technically within normal limits in size according to ct size criteria”, or something along those lines."

* Duration of complaint: 1 year
* Existing medical issues: Marfans

1 year ago I started getting random sharp stabbing pains in my head everywhere. I have went to doctors and they have said to not worry about it because they are just random headaches (icepick).

I now have a constant pressure feeling in my head that gets worse when blood gets flowing there and is painful  (bend over to pick something up, after physical activity(usually in the top right of head sharp pain), sneezing).

Had wisdom teeth removed a year ago and started acutane 1 year ago but stopped due to headaches every day (sharp head pains started 1 month after acutane)

I can admit that I have not been getting my recommended amount of calories every day over the past year. But there are times when I will eat well and still have the pressure.

I have a MRI scheduled but it could be a wait up to a year."

As of lately I keep getting more and more freckles / moles and skin discoloration. It's mostly on my arms and shoulders area but there's been a few on my stomach and face.
I read that this could be caused by sun damage but I don't really think I'm outside often enough for that to be it.

I've also asked my stepmom about it and she doesn't seem concerned but I think that these aren't supposed to continually show up."

I recently went paintballing at a birthday party followed by a long night of drinking.  The next day I woke up with pretty severe muscle pain but mostly all my friends did.  I thought nothing other than doms was the case so I just nursed my hangover and rested.  Today I woke up and I can barely get to a standing position and walking is slow and painful with restricted movement. I've been heating and icing and drinking lots of water hoping it will pass soon.  The thing that concerns me is that its throughout both legs and I've never had muscle pain like this.  I used to be a daily 3 mile runner and 20+ mile bicyclist.  Am I just being a wimp who has never pushed this far or should I be worried if things don't improve at least a little tomorrow?"

135,"Diagnostic puzzle pieces: Sauna use, paresthesia, drugs and more.","30 Male Canada 155lbs 

**Symptoms:** 

- Major: Unilateral paresthesia located in the right temporalis area; never painful, very annoying, is always present with varying degrees of intensity. 
- Minor: Unilateral sub occipital pain in the right occipital region; painful to apply pressure, causes headaches a few times a month. 
- Duration: 1 year with an onset after stress/panic attacks. 

Picture: The paresthesia presents specifically around [the temple areas of the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve](https://api.intechopen.com/media/chapter/53202/media/F2.png).

**Puzzle pieces:**

**Paresthesia sensation is more intense (worse) with:**

- Sauna use (Vasodilation?) - every, single, time. 
- Significant stress or anxiety. 

**Paresthesia sensation is less intense (better) with:** 

- Cold showers (Vasoconstriction?); 
- Stimulants (Vyvanse, Caffeine, etc). 
- Clonazepam 
- Pregabalin 
- Applying pressure directly to the temporalis muscle removes the sensation temporarily. 

**What is causing this tingling sensation and what can I do to stop it?** 

I've already done the offline due diligence; seen the MDs, dentists, optometrists, physiotherapists, blood work is done, etc. No findings or relief. I have no neurological symptoms, no loss of sense or touch, and therefore, no help or real concern from my GP."

[20M] It’s been almost a week since the crash happened, but feeling in my leg has remained the same. I cannot tell if bruising has increased or decreased. I have been applying ice to it normally. My right shin area has large purpleish spots ranging from a little below the knee to below my ankle, almost to the base of my foot. In terms of feeling, it has remained the same, I can't feel light touches but I can feel harder ones.


Should I seek urgent care? Thanks for your time, and I apologize if it's repetitive.

Medications: lexapro (20mg), busiprone (5mg 3x daily), and rexulti (1mg).

I started rexulti about 1-2 weeks ago to further help with my depression. Last night and throughout today I’ve started to have weird little muscle twitches. They aren’t painful but they feel weird. It’s not full blown loss of control where like I start making movements or anything, it’s just a small section will twitch. So far I’ve had them on my lower chest, left thigh and calf, and left forearm. Is this likely caused by rexulti (I know it can cause more severe muscle issues but I’m not sure if this qualifies) and is it something that I need to address right away or can it wait until my next appointment in a couple weeks?"

140,Old ankle injury,"Hi docs!

I’ve tried looking up research in academic journals to no avail, so I thought I’d ask here. I’m an equestrian and three years ago today, I had an accident in which I fell over the front of the horse I was riding and she accidentally stepped directly on the inside of my left ankle, and they are half-ton animals so the max weight that had landed on my ankle was anywhere from 250 to 1000 pounds depending on how her weight was being distributed. Usually I get back on and keep going whenever I fall but I was weeping like a baby and unable to bear weight on it a few mins later so the barn owner took me straight to the ER. Miraculously there were no fractures, so they chalked it up to a severe contusion. Walked with a boot up to my knee for a week, a shorter boot for a few weeks then ace bandaged it for the next few months, all while non stop RICE-ing it and taking 12 Advil a day. I’ve been trying physical therapy on and off for the last three years with different providers hoping one of them would work magic, but the swelling has never fully disappeared, the full range of motion has never returned and it still hurts on a regular basis (I ace bandage it on average 1-2 days a week, sometimes more in fall/spring). About a year ago, when I was getting it re-looked at by an ortho, he said if the PT didn’t work, the only way it would ever return to normal would be a surgery in which they would go in, remove the scar tissue and lengthen my Achilles’ tendon because it has contracted due to not being able to fully extend in two years. He also mentioned that this would require 6 months off of my feet while recovering, which just isn’t practical. The thing is, I thought the only thing keeping me from full range of motion was the scar tissue left behind, since my Achilles’ tendon wasn’t actually affected from the initial accident. Obviously I know the doctor knows better than I do, but the Achilles’ tendon lengthening just seems like it would be unnecessary- in theory, if I just got surgery to remove the scar tissue, wouldn’t I be able to do PT to stretch the tendon back out after the surgery, or is it too late/can it only be done surgically? Should I go get a second opinion?

Thank you in advance!"

142,"Odd, void-like sensation in the back of my head, isolated on my right side. Perhaps slight pressure? I say ""void"" because the feeling evokes a feeling of being pulled inward, like a blackhole.","Maybe it sounds ridiculous. Maybe it's psychosomatic, or maybe I'm imagining things, because it seems to correlate with my OCD-related habits.

Age: 26  
Sex: Female  
Weight: 143lb  
Height: 5'4""  
Race: White

**Duration of complaint:** On and off? It's been a thing for a while, and I'll explain that below, but sometimes it just disappears on me.  
**Location of complaint:** Right side of my brain, way in the back. [See this image.](https://i.imgur.com/M0wKyzd.png)  
It's hard to pinpoint, really, but that's a general guess.  
**Medical history:** Let me know what all you need here, but I can at least say that I've never had any brain- or head-related issues unless we're counting the one seizure I had at age 4, and having depression, anxiety, and ADHD. And OCD? Umm, I've fainted a couple times, during which I hid my head on the floor or a desk corner (once in 6th grade, once in sophomore year of college). Erm, I have issues with tinnitus? Apologies, but I don't know what all to put here, exactly.  
**Current meds:** 60mg Prozac; 150mg Wellbutrin; 5-10mg Adderall (All generics.) Also prescribed Blisovi FE 1.5/30, and generic Zyrtec (10mg?) for my cat allergy.  
As a note: I've been on Prozac for many years, must have started when I was 12 or 13. Slowly moved from 5mg to 10, then 20, then 40 for the longest time. In college, it became 60, and then about a week or two afterwards, someone else decided to make it 80 (!?), and I was on that up until about 2016, when another doctor lowered it back to 60.  
Note 2: The Wellbutrin is a recent addition to the mix. Doc wanted me to try that instead of the Vyvanse she had me on first, as it seemed to really dry out my eyes. On Oct. 30, she tentatively put me on Adderall as well... 5mg did literally all of nothing for the past four days, so I tried 10mg today (as she had instructed me to do if 5 was ineffective).

-----

Phew, okay, I think that's all that info out of the way.

Now then! The actual complaint! So right now, it sort of feels like both a dense fog and a painless-yet-uncomfortable sensation of pressure, and it is located in the back of my head on my right side. It seemed to flare up a bit any time I, let's say, *didn't* save an image to my computer. If I went back to the page and *did* save it, it would calm back down again, but I also could relieve it by opening my right eye as wide as I can. Not with my fingers, just purely with the muscles. That's why I was wondering if maybe it was a phantom sensation. But now it's not fixing it anymore. It's steadily gotten worse over the course of my typing this. Seems to be climbing upward. Spreading upward.

My right eye feels a weird bit of pressure now, too, but much less than what I'm feeling in my head.

**It is absolutely painless, but still very uncomfortable.** It's hard to concentrate, or to even think at all. Everything feels frustrating or infuriating, even somebody talking to me is annoying.

But, this kind of sensation isn't new to me. It's been a thing for years, right down to the ""you HAVE to do this thing to fix it"" aspect and the eye thing. It just hasn't ever gotten to the point where my eye is feeling the pressure, too.

Another note: It could be the alcohol. I've had two glasses of red wine tonight, but it's been at least 30 minutes (probably more, as I don't keep track of the time I stopped drinking like that). Haven't otherwise had any alcohol for about two weeks. The Adderall is supposed to last 4-6 hours, and it's been probably 8 hours since I took it last.

Anyway I guess a short version of that is ""brain pressure, what do?"" Because you probably don't need most of the info I've given.. But let me know if you do need anything else...

Edit: It's possible that I have Hashimoto's disease, but I don't think that would really tie in to this."
143,"Right ankle ""closed"" fracture advice","Sex: Male
Height: 5'10
Weight: 160 pounds
Age: 23

I have no existing medical conditions or any history in the affected area.

I fractured my right ankle over the weekend. I went two days just thinking it was a sprain before a friend dragged me to an urgent care. They took an xray and discovered a small fracture. The doctor there referred me to an Orthopedic specialist, but they cant take me until Monday next week. I have a boot and can walk in it with little to no discomfort/pain. He wrote ICD S82 409a on my referral card if that helps. I have no previous injuries on this foot/ankle.

Is it okay to walk on it for the next week if I am wearing the boot and not experiencing any pain or is it still absolutely necessary to use crutches alongside the walking boot?

* Weight - 190 lbs
* Race - white
* Duration of complaint - 3 1/2 years 
* Location - USA and Nose/Throat
* Any existing relevant medical issues - None 
* Current medications: None 

I have had a number of bothersome symptoms over the last three years:
- Loss of smell
- Post Nasal Drip (sometimes causes me to cough every minute, but most of time I can forget about it, but whenever I swallow I feel a strand of mucus stick in what feels to be the top of my throat.)
- Nasal Blockage/Congestion (Just 1 nostril blocked at a time) 

I have tried various remedies found online and suggested by a specialist:
- Inhaling Steam
- Drinking lots of water to thin mucus 
- Decongestants (Mucinex etc) 
- Flonase (steroid sprays) 
- Neti Pot 
- Saline Nasal Spray

None of these have helped resolve my congestion or post nasal drip. I will note that my congestion is probably better described as a blockage than congestion. As my nose is actually always dry and never has any boogers in it or mucus, yet I can’t seem to breathe through my nose well and I can still sometimes feel pressure near my nose from feeling congested. 

No allergies. I had a rather expensive test 3 years ago and my symptoms do not flare up at any particular time, but are present virtually 24/7. 

I do snore and upon recording my snoring I have discovered that sometimes I struggle to breathe through my nose. (My nose breathing becomes noisy and I can tell I am exerting effort to get enough air) 

I am beginning to think that maybe I have some structural problem or maybe polyps. However, my doctor prescribed Flonase to shrink polyps (if I had any) and I still did not see any improvement. Additionally, while I had an ENT from a few years ago tell me I had a deviated septum. A trip to an ENT this summer (for sleep issues) did not lead to any discovery of structural abnormalities or issues within my nose or throat. 

I plan on seeing an ENT, but I am wondering what people on here think first off."

147,Weird things keep happening?,"29FTM

I went to get my neck adjusted and two hours after the adjustment, a “ball” appeared on the right side of my throat, where my thyroid is. 

I am not sure if it was related or not. 

I was in a bit of pain and a few days later, now I’m fine but the “ball” is still there. 

I went to the doctor and they took some blood work they had some trouble finding my veins so they kinda mess me up (a lot of bruising on my arm)

Anyway now I notice my foot on the same side has this thick vein sticking out. I’m not sure if anything is related to each other it might just be coincidence but I’m afraid there’s something happening that maybe related to all of this."
148,Should I be concerned about a potential re-injury?,"18M, 5'11, 180lbs
4 years ago, I injured my knee in a car accident. I ended up with a partial tear in my right MCL. I didn't require surgery, just PT and was then cleared for regular physical activity. Last year, it started acting up again when I was skiing. I was told no extensive physical activity for 3 weeks and nothing else. No medication, no PT. Recently, I've been feeling it getting funky again. Just a little strained for a couple of hours at a time, but it would go away. Today I felt it acting up again, but this time it actually hurts. It was very noticeable when walking, and it hurts to straighten. There is no noticable swelling however. Should I be concerned?"
149,"What’s happening to my body, tingle sensation, when I go to sleep too late? 42 M","This has been something I’ve experienced for many years. More of a biological question than a ‘what’s wrong with me’ question. Being that I’m an over-40 male, I wonder if this is testosterone related. 

If I stay up too late, usually passed 11pm, my whole body starts to get something I can only describe as a tingle. But not in a good way. I feel drained - as if my energy is being drained to keep going. Yet, I don’t really have the urge to go to sleep. Quite the opposite actually. Pretty sure it’s not adrenaline.  

I try to go to bed by 10pm and like to wake up at 6am. This fluctuates an hour or two either way any given day of the week. I don’t usually set an alarm but 7-8 hours of sleep is typical regardless of what time I go to sleep. If I get less than 5 hours I sometimes have a hard time thinking and speaking coherently. 

The amount of sleep I get has nothing to do with how I feel. 12-8 feels worse than 10-4. The amount of time I’m awake is the larger variable. 

I also seriously lack exercise. I know that when I get a moderate amount of exercise I can go to sleep easier and feel better the following day. 

So, I sort of know the symptoms and what I should be doing to maintain my health and to get good sleep. But I’m lazy and have a hard time finding time to exercise. Still, my question is about what this sensation is. Aside from proper exercise and a more regimented sleep schedule, are there some vitamins or foods that I should or shouldn’t be consuming?

I'm honestly concerned about my school's food. My friends and I have joked about it, but at the same time we are concerned because a lot of the times the pork can be under cooked.  The food isn't really good here, sometimes steak is over cooked, the rice can be under cooked, and the food in general can just not be very good.

It started when I had a sore throat, which I assume was strep throat. After a week or so, the sore throat went away but my tonsil never went down and it’s been swollen ever since. Actually, both sides of the back of my throat are inflamed but I only have one tonsil. As a kid, I had lots of issues with infections so my tonsils were removed but either they neglected to take one or they didn’t take all of one and it grew back (is that possible?)

This may have something to do with being sexually active. I got strep almost within days of giving oral sex. I’ve been tested since then and came back negative for all except for syphilis but I had that last year and was treated for it. Apparently it’s normal to have syphilis tests come back not completely negative if you’ve had it before, but it doesn’t mean you’ve got it again. At least, that was what was explained to me by my university’s doctor. 

Anyway, my family doctor looked in my throat and my ears and said my ears were swollen inside and put me on amoxicillin for a week. It’s been almost a week and I see no change in my tonsil/throat inflammation. 

I’ve provided a photo of the back of my throat. It’s not pretty. https://imgur.com/a/ffOXtBh"
159,My neck feels like bone,"Hey so I made an account to hopefully get an idea of where to go with this. 
Probably since I was a teenager I've had bad shoulders and a bad neck. Nowadays it's worse. My neck feels like bone to the touch and my shoulders crackle everytime I rotate them. Massages and chiropractors help, but only for a few days, and they don't ever get my neck feeling like normal muscle. I do yoga as well to help this but generally I'm always hurting. 
I'm only 24 years old and I work as a delivery driver. I'm kind of high stress as a person and tend to sleep curled up, but I don't think any of that is enough to have murderered my neck and shoulders the way they are.
What could be wrong with my muscles and what can I do about it?"
160,I’m worried 25M,"First off, let me say I know what I did was stupid, and please only serious replies.

I’m a guy (25, 5’11, 150 lbs) and two weeks ago I met a guy at a bathhouse (I know) and after blowing him for about 5-15 seconds at the most, he says his boyfriend is hiv positive, but that he tested negative. He said that he could grab a condom, but I just left. I’m kinda freaking out because I know pre-cum carries the virus, but I’m not 100% sure if there was, because the blowjob was so quick.

I’m fairly educated in the subject, but what set off an alarm bell is that he said he had the “gene”, whatever that means because someone in his family ancestry had it at some point.

I will absolutely get tested in three months, but I don’t want to be obsessing over this for three months also. The reason I’m mostly freaking out tonight is because my throat feels a little dry when I swallow, and I read that that can be a symptom, but I think that that little irritation probably needs to be multiplied a whole lot for it to be considered a symptom, right? (although I’m a smoker, which I believe can also irritate your throat that way.)"
161,Ways to treat sinus and ear issues that are safe for glaucoma patients,"26 M 135 pounds 5""9 white north east USA


Sinus congestion and ear pain, fluid in ears, chronic recurring issue 


Formerly had retinoblastoma, cataract surgery as an infant,  diagnosed with glaucoma 3 years ago, pressure is now stabilized by Lumigan eye drops.


Can anyone recommend medications/treatments for sinus and ear issues that are safe for glaucoma patients? Now that I have glaucoma and can't use antihistamines anymore I'm finding it really hard to treat my chronic sinus issues. I just ran a course of augmentin that didn't work so my pcp gave me a medrol dose pack steroid, I'm yet to use this though because I want to double check with my ophthalmologist that this is safe for me to use. I have used things like saline sprays and neti pots in the past with no success, antihistamines were always effective but like I said I can't use them anymore unfortunately."

164,I bit the top of my wrist really hard and now from my first finger to middle finger all the way to the wrist is numb. Did I fuck up my hand? Please see the text for more info before posting:,"Disclaimer:

This NOT a post about whether or not I should seek medical attention. I do NOT have proper insurance for an emergency room visit because I'm in the US of Fucking A on gap insurance until I get actual insurance. (I can't get cheap in-state insurance because I just moved and without an in state driver's license insurance it would be at least $500 a month. I am currently waiting for my driver's license but it's been almost a month ffs)

My question: Will the feeling in my hand come back? The bite isn't bleeding and it hardly left a mark, but I think I accidentally bit where one of the veins and some tendons are. More specifically, it's the part where the thumb tendon and first two finger tendons intersect. Is is possible to damage nerve endings with a bite? How fucked up is my hand?

Some other notes: The area is from between my first and middle knuckles to shortly before the bite mark, but only the back of my hand and part of the web. The palm on my hand feels normal. Hand function is fine and there is no bruising, swelling, or weakness. The part where I bit myself doesn't hurt, but pushing down around the numb area hurts. Pushing down on the actual numb area doesn't hurt. If I touch lightly I don't feel anything, but pushing hard I can feel some pressure. My hand has felt numb for about 20 minutes without any noticeable change. At first it hurt so badly I had to curl up in a ball but then it just went numb.

166,"Please help, I hate my GI system and I CANNOT HANDLE this ANY MORE (if you have the magic answer, it will blow my mind).","First to get the basics out of the way:

* Age: 38
* Sex: F
* Height: 5'8'
* Weight: about 110lbs (was about ~125 four months ago and have lost all my muscle mass due to two surgeries)
* Race: white
* Duration of complaint: ~20 years that I can at least remember
* Location (Geographic and on body): abdomen, GI system
* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): celiac disease, ""Crohn's"" (probably not), ileostomy, osteoporosis, secondary amenorrhea
* Current medications (if any): none
* Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example): n/a

This will be long. But basically, the main issues are extreme stomach pain and discomfort; stool and gas pressure build up that is difficult to pass. But there's more to it...


 I have been having great GI distress as long as I can remember. I have had every test to test everything. I am not sure if I should give the whole history or if I should just address what is going on right now as we have made some attempts to fix it, so I'll do that first. 

I recently had an ileostomy done earlier this year. I have had to get it revised recently. It is an end ileostomy. However, the issue I am having has been going on for a VERY long time.

I got the ileostomy because I have extreme colonic dysfunction (no nerve function), as well as no rectum function and a sphincter that sucks. I have had every test and treatment you can imagine, so after I was in a clinical study to determine the exact location of the nerve function issue, it was recommended to go for an ileostomy which I agreed to do wholeheartedly. I figured it would stop the horrible issues and large amounts of meds I had to take every day just to get out of the house. I was living a very miserable life. 

The issue is (even for my first ileostomy, but even before that) is that as soon as I eat or drink anything, I get extremely bloated and pressure and pain in my abdomen (not sure where). eating is MISERABLE. Nothing feels good. This can even happen after water. I figured it was because of my colon issues, however, still happens with the stoma which is really disheartening. Sometimes it also feels like trapped gas -- I get a huge build up of pain and pressure. this used to happen all the time and now feels like a stoma blockage so, holy moly, I can;t believe that isn't solved. 

I do think that there is more than one issue going on. I have been diagnosed with IBS as well, and have tried everything to remedy that -- diet, lifestyle changes, everything. It was unmanageable beforehand, and until we actually had a test that determined my colon/rectum/anus were doing a terrible job, I figured it was that. Nothing could help relieve that unless I basically starved myself, drank liquids, and followed it by the equivalent of a colonoscopy prep. Not sustainable.

I am at my wit's end. I thought that the ilestomy was going to be the fix. Now my foods are even MORE limited as the reason my stoma was revised was because my intestine narrowed on itself (my surgeon doesn't know why but has ideas). He suggested I could try and go back on one of my motility drugs (I took prucalopride for years in addition to a cocktail of other drugs). I tried it for a few days, but it also made my colon (which I still have) act up and mucus was coming out like crazy. My output was also too crazy in liquid and I was becoming dehydrated and couldnt keep up. Either way, it doesn't seem like the solution, but I will be willing to try it again once my stoma heals from this surgery).

I have not had any upper GI testing in the last 15 years or so --I did have all the basics (barium, endoscopy) way back then. More recently, however, I did have a CT prior to the revision surgery (so a few weeks ago), which I believe would have showed some inflammation or anything going on up there.

My Crohn's diagnosis was questionable about 20 years ago because it came up on some tests but not others, but we just never really addressed it since ""it wasn't bad enough"".

My biggest symptoms are (1) stomach fullness and extreme bloating and pressure; (2) the pressure building up like I can't pass it into my stoma... this can be food or gas (3) gas does not expel, just gets trapped. The pain can get really insane. Sometimes there is nausea, but not much. With this new stoma, it seems to be working consistently so I dont think it is stomach emptying, but the pressure is there.

It gets relieved when I pass stool or gas. It is aggravated GREATLY if I have to pee or have a full bladder. I sometimes get up to use the toilet multiple times just to see if I can eke any more out.

I have tried every single possible dietary change. Low FODMAP, low residue... heck, this was even happening when I was NPO in the hospital for five days. Over 20 years, I have become very aware of what may or may not set it off.

This isn't some sort of 'oh, you have a stomachache', especially when I can't pass the stool. And, of course, I am getting terrified to eat and the pain from eating is crazy. I cannot lose any more weight. I have had osteoporosis for about ten years because of this bullshit.

This probably isn't even clear because I am losing it inside. I don;t know what else to do or what they can check for. I have read about things like Domperidone or Metoclopramide but dont think my issue is gastroparesis if I eventually pass stool?

What the frig could be going on? I literally can't take this anymore. I have missed the prime years of my life. This has changed the course of what I thought -- having a family, doing a PhD, and so on.

Yes, I have probably tried whatever you may suggest, but I do NOT think I am an anomoly. There has to be something. But i think at this point, I exhausted every possible lifestyle change and think there is something else.

I do not want to slow my output or be constipated, so I do not want to risk anything to do with that. I only feel ""okay"" when my stomach/abdomen/intestines feel 'empty'.

Please let me know what else to include. I know this is getting long, but like I said, between tests and remedies and meds... I've probably been there. :("

EKG came back completely normal, and my blood pressure was quote ""perfect"". Blood test also showed no infection.
After that i went to my mate's flat, where we smoked some weed and i spent the night. When i got home early in the mornng the Day thereafter and disrobed, i saw this rash on my left backside. It is not very big and pretty localized. It sticks out very slightly and itches a ton more if i scratch it.
Another thing i noticed on saturday is a bloated and sore tongue, seemingly only on the right side. I also have a tiny cold sore on the left side of my mouth/lip, behind my teeth, which bled a little when i brushed my teeth Just now. Otherwise No symptoms afaik.
No sexual or intimate activity with my friend.

Right now i have to wait to get into my next placebos on my hormones ~ thanksgiving time~ and to go get blood work to get my 11Desooxycortisol, progesterone and 17-OH progesterone. 

He will also email a buddy of his that is a professor in one of my state’s largest universities. The professor actually writes the testing guidelines for CAH and other hormonal issues so he’s hoping that his friend will reply in time. 
Like wise he suggested DNA testing like 23andme stating another person used it and that it came back positive for NCCAH! Though i have very good insurance and they cover genetic testings; he also knows a geneticist that my insurance will take!  

So im patiently waiting for this. And i will leave updates.

173,"19M I'm fairly sure (convinced myself) there's still glass under a cut, but tbh I have no idea."," 

I fell over onto my hands in the dark a few Saturdays ago, and there was broken glass on the floor. Opened a cut and took off a bunch of skin. I washed it with warm water and gave it some antiseptic, didn't check for anything left over because I didn't want to poke around too much. Now that it's healing over and a nice big scab has formed I can feel a hard lump under/on the upper right side of it. The skin around the healing area is really soft, I opened some of it up just by poking it a bit with a toothpick, but I don't want to poke around further (i.e. reopen the cut) and jeopardise the healing. When I press in a specific place or press the scab to the table, there's a sharp pain. Also where the pain is is slightly raised.

Obviously no one here can say for certain, what I'm really asking is should I go see a GP or is this just me being paranoid.

184,Weird rash on several different antibiotics,"Sex: F
Age:25
Current meds: buspar, vyvanse, breo, singular, Allegra 

Location of complaint: face/neck/chest/shoulders 

I seemed to have developed an “allergy” to amoxicillin, clindamycin, and Cefpodoxime. It’s not anaphylactic but seems to be immune related according to the doctor. I never had a problem until a few years ago when I took amoxicillin and clarithromycin for H.Pylori. After a few days, I developed a red rash on my shoulders and face that evolved into pinhead size pustules. Allergy testing was negative so they thought it was just a one off thing. 

The next time I took amoxicillin for strep throat I developed a similar rash after a few doses. They thought it was from the strep but changed the antibiotic anyway. I took amoxicillin again for a sinus infection and got the same rash (but more widespread/worse than the previous times especially on the chest/neck) after only two doses.  I also got really achy joints when I took the amoxicillin. 

A year or so later I was given Cefpodoxime and developed the same rash after 2 or 3 doses and had never been on that antibiotic before. 

A few months ago, I was given Clindamycin for a sinus infection (first time on clindamycin) and developed the same kind of flat red turned pustular rash after a few days. 

The rash is kind of painful and looks almost like shingles or measles before it turns into small pimple like pustules. 

I have never had mono (negative for IgG and IgM antibodies as of last week). I guess my question is how serious is this reaction and will I be unable to take these antibiotics (and classes of antibiotics) for the rest of my life? Is there anything that could be causing this or any other testing I should discuss with my allergist about getting?

Fast forward to now, and I swear they are causing me pain. I first noticed some pain in the sides of the groin area, where I had swollen lymph glands, I thought it was a coincidence. However then I noticed pain in two other areas aswell, my neck and under my chin. Both of these areas have swollen lymph glands. Is this serious? Should I go see a doctor?"
188,"If I don't MRI, will I die?","First, sorry for the title, I thought it was catchy. 

I am a 30 year old female. I have SLE with discoid manifestations. I take a significant amount of medications including Cellcept, Methotrexate, hydroxycloriquine, viagra, gabapentin and I am a participant in a clinical trial for a biologic. I have a history of really bad headaches, but within the last year my autoimmune disease has started becoming under control and the headaches have disappeared, therefore I quit taking topamax.  I smoke, but don't drink or use any recreational drugs. I have three related questions, but mainly my concern is whether or not an MRI/MRA is absolutely necessary. I am going to preface this with saying I dislike doctor's appointments and I am tired of the plethora of tests. 

Last Tuesday, I went into my GP because a few days prior I heard my heartbeat in my ears (it sounds exactly like an ultrasound of a fetal heartbeat). I have been hearing my heartbeat on a somewhat regular basis for around 3 years, it started when I was on a fairly high dose of steroids. I can only hear my pulse when I am lying down. I went to the doctor because lately the noise has been quite significant and strong. It has sounded like a train was running through my head, all while my head and neck was throbbing and my room appeared to be breathing. It has been so loud and strong, it wakes me. When I wake up, I have a severe pounding headache and am drenched in sweat. My primary care doctor referred me to get an MRI/MRA study, and my first question is whether it is absolutely necessary. By that, I mean will I die if I don't pursue this or is it more of an inconvenience?

My doctor also had asked me if I had any neurological symptoms. While I have a lot of weird and unexplained symptoms, I am unsure of what really constitutes a neurological symptom and what is just kind of wonky. Some of the weird things I experience are: eye problems, neuropathy, strange walking, memory and speech issues, ""lightheadedness"". I can go into depth, but I feel crazy talking about some of these things. This brings me to my second question, what should I tell my doctor about? 

The last question I have is about family history. I only have knowledge about my maternal side. In that, there are neurological disorders. My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and a brain tumor, my grandfather was diagnosed with Parkinson's. My mother also has a brain tumor (according to their neurologists, their tumors are NOT hereditary). My aunt has a thyroid disorder and my brother has a traumatic brain injury and asthma. How much of this is really relevant? I ask because while I can recite this here, I get so overwhelmed at the doctor's office that I forget most of it."
189,Clogged ear and bad cough.,"I'm 27 male, 5'6 around 185lbs Hispanic. 
My main complaint is my clogged ear, it happened last week when I slept for close to 12hrs. I woke up and my left ear was clogged. I thought it would go away but after a few days it didn't go away. I thought it was ear wax, but I keep my ears clean, so I bought a ear candle hoping this would help but nope. A week later it is still clogged. Whenever I blow my nose it gets more clogged then it goes away slightly when I swallow saliva but it is still clogged. A few days later I started getting a bad cough and started taking mucinex for a few days, then moved to Sudafed when I ran out. 
I Googled ways how to get rid of clogged ears and I tried everything and nothing works. 
Whenever I cough in the mornings after waking up, I spit out greenish phlegm, but throughout the day it's usually clear. If I don't make myself cough I feel it builds up. 
I drink alcohol, but havnt recently. I smoke weed but stopped since my cough occurred. 
I don't have any existing medical conditions."

191,Femur won’t heal-3rd surgery (19M),"Femur wont heal-3rd surgery

Hi all, 

In November 2017 I broke my femur due to a bone cyst in my femur and was in hospital for a month and had a biopsy done - I was 17 when it happened and got metal plates and screws put in. Fast forward a year and I needed another surgery as the metal moved and got displaced so I had that surgery in May of this year. Understandable as without anything holding the bone in place it can't heal. I had another surgery May of this year. I am now 19 and I went to my consultant on Friday and he told me although the bone tried to heal it stopped healing- so now I've got another appointment in 2 weeks to discuss further surgery. My question is what is the issue here. I have had my bloods done and they are all fine, I am not allergic to anything and do not have diabetes. Yes I am on the heavier side but surely no weight bearing helps with that. Could there be issues with bloodflow. Also, I am not exactly sure but some people have told me the fracture could've done damage to the inside of the leg- the fracture itself was called subtrochanteric. Thank you for any help I really appreciate it."
192,Red and itchy scrotum,"Hi,

I'm an 18 year old male, 290 lbs, 6 foot, living in the UK with no sexual history.
Previous conditions: psoriasis, NAFLD

In the past few days, my scrotum has been much itchier than normal and today whilst in the shower I noticed that they were quite red with the exception of the ""seam"" which seemed to be normal skin colour. I had a Full Blood Count, Thyroid Test, Kidney test and Liver Enzymes test which were for my NAFLD which all came back fine bar my liver results but this was expected. 

I currently take a Vit D3 1000 IU tablet once a day. I use a coal tar shampoo, betamethasome scalp application and a moisturising cream. I recently started using calcipotripol and betamethasome ointment about 2 weeks ago.

I should be getting an appointment soon with the doctor to discuss my NAFLD so I can show him then but I'd like some possible suggestions."
193,I need help understanding symptoms relating my BM!,"Just for context, if it matters, I'm a 27yo male. I've always had fairly regular BM, leaning more towards loose stools than the contrary, but now everything is working very wrong!

It started about three months ago, with a strange feeling and an itch around and inside the anus. At first I thought my anus was just sore due to anal sex, but after a week feeling like that I noticed a lump on the outside of my butthole, almost like it swollen. It grew a little then it started to get smaller after a few days. At the same time my BM started to get really irregular, making me go to toilet 10-12 times a day and poo probably 7-8 of those times, always diarrhea or close to that. This lasted for a month and half, more or less, and during that time the itch in my anus grew really uncomfortable almost to the point I couldn't seat. At the time I thought it was hemorrhoids, since I also noticed blood in the toilet paper and in my feces, but I've also experienced extreme belly pain that make just want hold still until they pass, bloating, and severe flatulency with a really strong smell. I've went to the doctor and after I told him my symptoms and he examined my belly and my anus he sent me home and said I had nothing. To be sincere, I feel like him didn't care much to listen to me and he just devaluated everything I told him.

Fastfoward to now, I'm better but I still have many symptoms! I'm going to toilet around 3-5 times a day to poo and I always have to rush because it comes all of a sudden, most times following stomach pain and smelly farts. My feces are always very loose, (close to diarrhea most times) and have a somewhat orange color to it. Occasionally, I will still notice blood or a white mucus around the feces.  After I go to the toilet I feel this uncomfortable feeling on my anus, almost like it is stinging and throbing. Also, I sometimes notice a small lump in my anus, but it goes away and comes back again after a day or two or a few hours.

Now, I don't know what to do! I plan to go to another doctor soon, since I still have symptoms but I'm afraid I'll be told once again I have nothing. I don't know what it could be, but I've suspected of IBS, or some kind of food intolerance... Can anyone make a guess, based on what I wrote?"
194,Small bump along hairline. Muscle knot or tumour?,"16F, 5""7, 11st 4lbs, white/asian, no relevant existing medical issues, don't smoke/use rec. drugs or take any medications. 

I'm really concerned about this lump on the back of my neck, just slightly to the right of the middle of my hairline. Base of my skull. Right now it feels like a small marble underneath the skin, hard, very slightly tender to the touch (but that may be due to me prodding it so much, I'm not sure). It feels quite prominent when I turn my head to the left, and almost impossible to feel when I turn my head to the right, and I can't feel it as prominently when I tense the muscles in that area (leading me to think that it might be a muscular problem?). I guess I have problems with posture, being a student I'm almost constantly hunched over work/a computer and I know this causes issues for me, so I am trying to reassure myself that this is just a simple muscle knot. I've heard that a muscle knot can feel the same - small, hard, painless - but this has been here for around 7 weeks now. I can't find anything on the internet about how long muscle knots can last, but surely not this long? It hasn't changed in size and I don't have any other symptoms aside from occasional severe headaches/tension headaches. I've tried to massage it but nothing happens, it only makes the area red and aggrivated. It can't be seen from outside, only felt when I press into the area. I went to a doctor around one week after I found it and she told me not to worry, that I had tense muscles and that ""it's not your lymph nodes or anything"" but I'm still not convinced, what if she didn't feel the area properly? If you haven't guessed already, I struggle with very bad health anxiety and this drives me crazy every time I think about it. Could anyone give any advice on muscle knots/what this could possibly be? Do I need to go to a doctor again? Seven weeks seems far too long to not worry about a lump. Thanks."
195,17F Weird brain related symptoms,"F17 Many brain related symptoms! Please help!

About a month ago I had an episode where for about 5 minutes I completely blanked out, I was conscious and talking but I have no recollection of the conversation. I was not under the influence of any substances. 

It’s happened a couple times since then. 

But ever since the initial incident I’ve been having terrible headaches almost constantly, often unbearable pain where my head feels like it weighs 100 pounds. I’ve been seeing flashes of light, sometimes white flashes in a dark room and other times my vision will go a certain colour like green or red. I’ve been so confused about so much... it’s so difficult for me to concentrate. Also been twitching a lot. 

I’m getting worried as it’s been going on for awhile and has done nothing but progress"
196,Unknown if my psychiatric diagnoses are accurate or if there’s something else wrong with me?,"20F, 5’3”, 110lbs, white. I currently take celexa (20mg) and I have a paraguard IUD. I vape and rarely (once a month) have a drink, even more rarely (2-3 times per year) use recreational drugs (LSD mostly). I am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and C-PTSD. 

My issue is that I think there’s a broader underlying mental health issue that I’ve been affected by for the last 6 years (from what I can remember). I was diagnosed with MDD and GAD when I was 15, but felt that I wasn’t being listened to because my step mother did all the talking and they didn’t listen to me. So I did my own research to become my own advocate when I was 18, which is why I got diagnosed with C-PTSD (I’m not contesting this, I do believe I have this).  Ultimately I think that the depression and anxiety I experienced as a teenager was situational due to my family life, whereas now they’re more symptoms of a broader issue at hand. 

The symptoms I am concerned about are as follows: 

-Regular cycling between periods of feeling “fine” or content and being depressed. The cycling is very regular but the duration of the episodes change over time. Typically they each last about a week. 

-When I am in a “happy” episode I have trouble staying asleep but do not experience symptoms of mania, EG no impulsivity or grandiosity or hypersexuality and that jazz. I do experience a marked increase in confidence, higher levels of energy, quickened thoughts/faster “brain processing”, I am more distractible, I am constantly fidgeting, and I can sometimes be more irritable. 

-When I am in a depressive episode, I experience a sudden onset of moderate to severe depression. This includes sleeping for much longer, constant fatigue, occasional suicidal ideation, brain fog, decrease in sexual desire, etc. 

-I find that I always experience a depressive episode the week before menstruation, but they don’t ONLY correlate with my menstruation. 

-I was on celexa for two years in high school, and I went off of it when I was a freshman in college because I felt like it stopped working for me. My mood cycling continued even after being off of it. I also took zoloft for a couple months in high school which made me extremely suicidal and aggressive. 

-I got back on the celexa at the beginning of this fall semester (September) to try to control the cycling. Now, the “happy” episodes still happen, but the depressive episodes are much longer and much more severe than they were before. 

-Don’t know if this is related, but I experience aversion to a lot of foods based off of texture alone so I have very little appetite at all times. Could be sensory processing issues though; I have problems with what I perceive as loud sounds and also general sensory “chaos” where I totally shut down. 

-I am totally unable to focus on anything that I’m not interested in and even then I have very little motivation, even during my “happy” episodes and I’m easily distractible to the point where it takes me hours to finish a short assignment (if i do at all), I have to get up and leave during class because I feel building “pressure” in my body to move, or I have to constantly fidget or do some activity in order to stay focused during lectures. 

-I have a family history of ADHD (most people in my family are diagnosed), and my biological mother has Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder and some type of either Bipolar Disorder or Borderline Personality Disorder (not in contact with her so I can’t clarify). Both my twin brother and my father are diagnosed with ADHD as well. 

I went to my nurse practitioner about it today and she’s trying to get me an appointment with the psychiatrist before she tries any new medication, because she’s afraid of putting me on another antidepressant if SSRIs haven’t worked for me in the past and my issues aren’t just anxiety and depression. I’m also tired of being shirked off by my doctors when I insist something is wrong or not being accounted for, so any advice that can be given to help me advocate for myself would be greatly appreciated !!"

199,Really need help/answers,"Hey guys, I know I just posted on here recently but I had an update and figured I could try again. I am a 22/F, 119lbs, no other medical history. 

My first night sweat was about a year and 1/2 ago, since then they’re prevalent but not every night. Around this time I started dropping weight I lost just about less than >30lbs, I itch mainly on my back, i got a rash a few weeks ago on my forearm that started as red on day one & doesn’t itch but the next day was brown, wrinkly and is just there. I have chest pains, rapid HR at rest, fatigue, terrible back pain and time to time achy bones/joints. Nothing came all at once so I didn’t think anything about it and brushed everything off till August when I found an enlarged lymph node that waxed and waned in my neck (hard/rubbery), haven’t been sick since last March and never noticed it before. 

One dr noted in August it was 1.5 cm and that there was more on my right but much smaller. I’ve been ruled out for RA, Mono, Lupus, Diabetes etc. was referred to cardiology and I have my echocardiogram, stress test, and I get a monitor tomorrow, he told me he thinks it could possibly be lymphoma. My internist dr (who referred me to the cardiologist) said that if the rest of my tests came back normal I would go to hematology and she ordered an ultrasound. Well the only thing was that I had elevated IGA levels and nothing else (my level was 12, and ref range was <=6)  my ultrasound result said 

“A lymph node was identified on right side of neck 0.8x0.4x0.3cm

A lymph node was identified on the left side of neck 0.9x0.3x0.6cm

A lymph node was identified on the left superior neck 1.6x0.4x1.5 that appears to be prominent neck tissue, no blood flow seen within”

My question is: 

where do I go from here? 

What could this mean? 

Are ultrasounds trustworthy with lymphoma? 

Has anyone else gotten a ultrasound with lymphoma or a blood cancer and what we’re your results? 

I feel so defeated. I didn’t even notice or google all these symptoms when they came and I should have."
200,[16F] I vomit every time I drink alcohol,"About a year ago I went to my first real party and had more than a sip of alcohol for the first time. I had a beer and a few sips of fireball and I got a little buzzed but I was fine. About a month and a half later I had two cans of hard iced teas with 5% alcohol and I puked 15-20 mins after finishing the second. On another occasion I had a beer and half way through the second one I puked. I finally decided that if next time I drink I puke, I’m not going to drink. I go to a party again and I literally don’t even finish one can of vodka iced tea and I vomit. I start feeling nauseous and then I puke once and then I feel fine. I haven’t drank since then because alcohol just makes me puke and I don’t get the faintest bit drunk.

Obviously this isn’t really a big deal because I can avoid it by not drinking but it kind of sucks not being able to drink with my friends. I’m hoping someone could provide some potential answers as to why I apparently have zero alcohol tolerance and if there’s a way to do something about it?"

I've had pneumonia multiple times before, and this doesn't feel the same at all, it hurts more and I feel like my body is trying to get something out of my right lung but it's not coming up much or easily as when I had diagnosed pneumonia.

202,Lump on the left side of my neck that is accompanied by headaches/dizziness,"20M, 5'8 140lbs, no medication, no health issues

2 weeks ago, I started getting neck pain on both side of my neck but mainly the left. Accompanying the neck pain was a mild headache and dizziness. I thought I put too much pressure on my neck because I have had neck pain with similar symptoms in the past due to strained muscles. One thing to note is that I did have a slight cold that healed 4 days ago and  I went to my GP last week and they said that the headache/dizziness were just symptoms. However, after 2 weeks it still hasn't really gotten better (or worse, really). 

Recently, I started doing exercises and massages for my neck muscles and I noticed that when I tilt my neck slightly towards the right, I can feel a hard unmoving 2cm lump in the middle of the left side of my neck. There doesn't seem to be any pain and my right side has no similar lump. I found the lump yesterday. Normally I cannot feel the lump but I'm not sure if it's always been there or if it popped up recently so I am a bit concerned."

I have been experiencing increasing back and hip pain. I have been dealing with this pain for several months and as a result got referred to a pain clinic. I received injections into my facets that didn’t work. The pain clinic absolutely refused to prescribe anything for pain. I have tried every over the counter method, woo spiritual horse shit method, exercise/stretching.... I’m in the process of trying to lose weight (it is slow going)... whatever to try and get this pain to settle down. I will try ANYTHING! 

I have tried: stretching, physical therapy, yoga, meditation, ibuprofen, meloxicam, cbd oil, heat packs, cold packs, compression/ wraps, oils/creams, massage, tens unit, lidocaine, muscle relaxant, facet injections, Tylenol, naproxen, sleeping legs up, sleeping sitting up, 

This weekend it came to a head where is was very bad 8/10 pain that sent me to the ER. Come to find out that the ER won’t treat with more than some anti-inflammatories because I’m being seen by the pain clinic. The pain clinic doesn’t have an after hours/weekend line. I hear back from them today. They still won’t prescribe anything to get me through this rough patch. I can barely move. Stairs are like a mountain to me and it takes me forever to go anywhere because I shuffle like an old lady. 

At this point I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what my options are. I don’t live in a big city... so this is the only pain clinic in town.  Basically, I know pain meds are not a long term solution, but I feel like losing weight will probably help my back and hip. However, right now at 8/10 pain I can hardly get out of bed, let alone exercise.

I've been off alcohol while on the med. Knowing that alcohol basically 'enhances' the effect of this and many drugs in your bloodstream... would having let's say 2 beers (nowhere near enough to get loopy and sick) 'bring the med back', per se, enough so to reduce the potential withdrawal symptoms?

205,Chicken or the Egg? (M43),"Male, 43, relatively good health. No drinking or drug use.

Symptoms over the past three months:

Ears: Tinnitus, fullness, itchiness, hyperacusis, fluttering

Muscles: Neck (SCM in particular) and shoulders are extremely tight/painful to the point I've needed trigger point injections (which don't help for long).

Teeth clenching at night.

Clicking in TMJ joint on same side as the more troublesome ear issues. Slight soreness in jaw and teeth.

I've got a total chicken and egg situation here where I'm trying to identify the root cause of what's going on. I've seen ENTs, neurologists, pain docs, naturepaths, etc. and no closer to getting a proper diagnosis because each specialist has their own opinion based upon their area of expertise. Where is Dr. House when you need him?

Sleeping is difficult because of the muscle pain. Muscle relaxers work but shortly after taking one I noticed a new sound in my one ear that reacts to other sounds. It reminds me of a beacon and gets louder when I yawn, so it's like something is being stretched out or irritating that ear. It continues to get more bothersome each day and then the fluttering of the muscle in that ear started, although only when I'm lying down for the most part.

Can tight muscles in my neck be the root of the issue? And could the pain be causing the clenching ... or is the clenching causing the pain and the muscles to get tight? And what is the root cause of the muscles being tight - stress, or something like lyme disease (or a coinfection)? 

TMJ dentist of course thinks it's my bite that is causing all of these issues, which could very well be true, but he won't make money unless he makes that claim so I'm skeptical about spending $$$$ on something I may not need. Already learned the hard way that a night guard actually makes the clenching (and ear issues) worse!

Which avenue is best to pursue here since each doc has a different opinion (except the ENTs which just tell me there's nothing remarkable)? 

My options:

TMJ treatment

Trigger point injections and physical therapy directly to the muscles

Treating as if I have lyme (western blot negative, though everyone is telling me that doesn't mean squat)

Or if I'm totally missing something else, please tell me. Thanks."

Lately when I drink and smoke, I’ve been feeling pain in areas of body where lymph nodes are located. My other symptoms are throat discomfort, some itching and random itchy lumps appearing on body. Earlier this year I have lymph nodes removed because had swell after a cold. They were negative for lymphoma. All was well but recently I have had a beer and cigarettes, which I know I should quit soon. I have been been feeling pain all over body and even a rash on my chest as well. I also have pain near my ears and chin/jaw area. The thing is since it’s so many areas I don’t know where to check for. My doctor did a CT scan and X-ray of my chest and both were negative. That and the lymph node removal, along with my age, causes doctors to dismiss anything serious. Even though I know I should quit smoking(and drinking as well) I still do get worried. I have appointments with my pulmonologist, ENT, and even my neurologist said he will help me. I also have a dermatologist I have to go to as well.

210,Intramedullarey cyst at T11 level and slightly bulging disc at T9-T10.,"Age 49

Sex Male

Height 183 cm.

Weight 92 kg.

Race White.

Duration of complaint 3 years and 8 months.

Location Sweden. Thoracic spine.

Any existing relevant medical issues 

Current medications None.

Include a photo if relevant  [MRI image](https://imgur.com/a/izj2XLN)

So my symptoms are an extremely tight area around the T9 to T11 area in my thoracic back, it feels like the muscles are constantly contracting but not like a cramp. And it is not the shallow muscles but the deep ones on the spine. I also have wierd tightness / irratiaton in the right Teres major / infraspinatus and the right scapula feels unstable, 

It is more prominent on the right side of the spine and if i bend the thoracic area to the left it gets really tight.

I have done alot of stretching / training went to all sorts of physios and massage but nothing has helped, Im currently doing a full body training program with added exercises to strenghten the back (rows, facepulls, lat pulldowns and more)

The orthopeadeic doctor and neurosurgeon who has examined the MRI's and such both claim that my problems cannot come from the cyst or bulging disc (although they say they have never experienced a cyst like this before..). My own googling show several case reports where cysts like this gives strange symptoms.

So, i would like to get some good insight from someone who has experienced this kind of cyst in the spinal cord if my problem can be ralated to the cyst or bulging disc?

I have no symptoms of misfunction otherwise from the cyst, strangely enough. It looks kinda big to me. 

Thank you."
211,"(Long post, please read all of it) Congestion in throat for past few days, controllable cough since today + question for similar ish thing from last year","Tl;Dr: Congestion in throat, there's stuff to cough up but it's hard to cough it up, but I'm not forced to cough.No runny nose,no fever (for now 🙏), hateD medicine with a passion, am now ok with it, but still hide all sicknesses as much as possible, every day condition below, will post updates in the coming days 

First things first, English isn't my first language so I I apologize if you don't understand something. I can clarify it if needed.

Details: 13, Male, 170cm, 50kg, From Bulgaria, European, no other med problems as far as I know,
Obviously don't smoke or drink as I'm under 18,
Currently not taking any other meds

As for available medications at home: Ventolin syrup (salbutamol), might be more

Complaint: For the last few days (I think since Friday, which wasn't a school day) I've had this complaint.
Woke up on Friday (1.11.19/d.mm.yy)with a little bit of a weird throat/voice. It wasn't sure but my voice was a bit raspy.
After a little clearing it went away for the rest of the day.

Saturday morning (2.11.19), I woke up with the same thing, managed to clear it, but around 9AM it kinda came back (you know how when you have a wet cough and have mucus and when you breathe, there is a snoring sound). That's what I got but mucus was pretty loose so I managed to clear it.

Sunday morning (3.11.19), same thing (without the snoring). Except this time mucus wasn't loose at all so I couldn't clear it.
Around noon, when I spoke, you could hear that there was gunk in my throat. Rest of the day was like this, but better.

KINDA IMPORTANT THING: Might be stupid, but when I was younger, I HATED medicine WITH A PASSION, so I try to hide sicknesses as much as possible from my parents. I don't clear my throat near them, I don't blow my nose near them, I don't cough if they are in the apartment. For some reason, I feel like everytime I'm sick, they're annoyed and angry. Not sure if all parents are like that. (more at the bottom)

Monday (4.11.19) woke up at 7:30 because we had a school meetup. Voice was better, but felt congested. Not terribly so, but more than any other day. Parents weren't at home so I grabbed a pillow and started coughing into it. Btw I'm not forced to cough for now, if I want to cough, I do it, I'm not forced. I can control it. Coughed for about 2mins, barely even cleared my throat but at the end of the fit, cough turned from mostly dry to a raspy/barky one? Kinda like when your throat and lungs are really irritated.
Later, coughed the phlegm (nothing came out, just cleared it from my throat). At school, played soccer for 2hrs. Quite often, I coughed to clear my throat. It was a lot wetter, but barely clearing my throat. In the evening, I had that snoring thing again when breathing. Managed to cough very quietly and clear it.

I haven't taken any medications yet, as mentioned above my parents don't know, don't want to go to the doctor and as far as my parents don't know, I obviously won't go

Story from last year: 22.10.18 (monday)/ my bday, was at school, T probably under 10C but stupid me decided to take off tank top and play only with t shirt and shorts. It was really cold.

Tuesday: a little bit of gunk, cleared it, no problems afterwards

Wednesday: morning, same bit of gunk, but couldn't clear it, my parents noticed it and gave me (dont know if it counts as a cough drop, it's called Efizol in Bulgaria)
At about noon, in between classes, got that snoring thing, coughed, it was really wet, then cleared the gunk I'd just coughed from my throat for 2mins.
Came home and it happened a few more times

Thursday: was fine in the morning, but same snoring and cough, although it got a bit more violent and uncontrollable

Friday: kind of a good/bad/good/bad day theme
Woke up more congested than any other day, couldn't clear it, while going to school w/ my mom and talking to her, I had to stop talking because I would have started a coughing fit in front of her, manage to hold it off and cough a bunch all day in school, knew things were getting worse

Friday night: woke up at night bc my body was trying to cough, but I somehow managed to hold in my sleep, went to bathroom to breathe a little bit, I was insanely congested, could barely breathe. Went back to bed, same coughing, but held it off for 30mins until it woke my mom up, I lied to her that nothing was wrong, she thought I was going to throw up, brought a basin, I coughed for a minute maybe, RELIEF

Saturday: all day snoring but hiding the cough during my bday party

Saturday night: mom told me if I had to cough to cough so i did and it was a lot easier and a lot less violent

Sunday morning: parents went and bought cough syrup, think it's herbal/medicine mix but dont know if it's an expectorant, suppressant or both

That made it worse, because at night, violent cough of Friday was back, coughed up once, then couldn't breathe very well, bc I had to do it again. My lungs hurt from coughing and breathing was difficult. Not exaggerating.

Monday: coughed all day at school, was close to throwing up once, bc of it, but idiot I am, didn't go to school nurse until after classes, she called my mom and told both me and her to take me to the doctor.
He prescribed ventolin.

Things got a lot better, but was still coughing violently the next week and had chest pain for a few days

Sorry for long post, but I gave out all the details. Thank you for reading all of it, any recommendations  for medicine I should take, says to overcome fear of showing sickness to parents or telling them that I am sick, and guesses on what I currently have and what the other week of pain was caused by would be greatly appreciated."
212,"Upper GI Bleed? Dark brown stools, chest pain, stomach pain (21 Male)","Age: 21

Sex: Male

Height: 176cm / 5'9""

Weight: 70kg / 154lbs

Duration of Complaint: 20 hours

Chronic medications: Escitalopram (10mg/day), Methylphenidate (2x10mg/day). Escitalopram was started 13 days ago, Methylphenidate started 5 years ago.

****

For the past 20 hours, I have been having stomach pains, and the central chest pain had also appeared in the past 8 hours or so - pain is related to position and most noticeable when reclining forward, but doesn't worsen with breathing, and doesn't feel like pressure.

Around when the chest pain started, I had dark brown stools that smelled badly. This had happened before, but only when consuming major amounts of dark chocolate - last time I consumed any dark chocolate was 4 days ago (but I haven't pooped for the past 2-3 days due to calorie restricting for weight loss - 1200kcal/day, a deficit of about 800 for me - broke the diet 12 hours ago, so that's probably why I pooped today).

An hour after the dark brown stools, I had diarrhea, which was light brown - the diarrhea might have been because I broke the diet 12 hours prior with a massive amount of food (gave in).

I feel quite okay otherwise, just tired, but I'm always quite tired. My SpO2 according to my phone is 98%, heart rate 76 BPM, blood pressure on 3 tests with an automatic cuff -  1) 106/60, 2) 103/56, 3) 102/58.

The stomach pain slightly eased up after the second time pooping (after the diarrhea which was light brown), but the chest pain remains.

I've also took Agmatine, a Nitric Oxide booster vasodilator supplement, yesterday. I've today read that SSRIs can significantly increase the risk of upper GI bleeding. I'm afraid that the combination of SSRIs + Agmatine (nitric oxide booster vasodilator) could have led to bleeding.

I also drank 3 cups of black coffee yesterday, before having the dark brown stools today - can it be related?

What should I do?

****

**TL;DR:** Started taking Escitalopram 13 days ago, been dieting with calorie restriction (1200kcal/day) for the past 3 days, started having stomach pain 20 hours ago. Broke my diet 12 hours ago with a massive binge of food, had position-related chest pain starting 6 hours ago, passed dark brown firm stools 2 hours ago, and then light-brown diarrhea 1 hour ago (hadn't pooped since I started the diet until today, after breaking it). What should I do?"
213,My (28F) resting heart rate is a little concerning lately... should I even see a doc for it?,"28 white female, history of anxiety disorder and ptsd managed with beta blockers and therapy (rarely use beta blockers). Vaped nicotine for two years before quitting in 2018. Symptoms have been going on for about two weeks.

-
So I’ve noticed for the last two weeks I have been experiencing dizziness and an extremely high resting heart rate for about an hour usually in the afternoon. I was sitting down at work and despite all efforts, my Fitbit was measuring my heart rate at 140-150 bpm. 

I have to say this did NOT come from any kind of anxious or panicky feelings. I was actually feeling relatively normal, before I started to notice I was getting a little dizzy and weird feeling like I was going to pass out. And I did feel a slight numbness in my face but again, this didn’t exactly feel like a panic attack. I wasn’t even freaking out about the heart rate, just confused. It eventually went back down after an hour or so of just sitting and I made myself drink ice cold water to get rid of the dizziness.

This has been occurring usually in the afternoon about an hour after I eat lunch. I only drink black tea in the morning and don’t drink anymore caffeine. I can’t exactly think of a trigger for this. I say this doesn’t feel like a panic attack because I am aware of what used to trigger those attacks and I used to always feel like I was actually dying during those.

In these spells, I’m just agitated and worried about the high rate. Today’s was definitely the worst. It stayed in the 140s for quite a bit."

I have had yellowish eyes for as long as i can remember(I am 17 and had this for at least 7 years).

this is a big thing for me since it has caused me anxiety since people often notice it and ask.

&#x200B;

So, I have been doing some research on some of my behaviors and I had some questions because I have had these symptoms my whole life, but now its affecting me physically and mentally like they have gotten worse.

I am in nursing school and finish up in May and I work full-time. So needless to say I am always doing something, but even in my down time  I feel like I have to be doing something or starting some kind of project. The problem is I start a project or get into something and I become OBSESSED with it. Hours and hours of online research, buying thing for it, and putting my school work on the back burner for it. Then after about two weeks I lose interest and move onto the next thing. 2 months ago it was traveling, I made a document with prices for plane, hotel, cars etc. to all of these different places even knowing I cant afford it yet, Put a down payment on a cruise I cant afford for next summer. Then i just stopped caring got my deposit back and moved on. Then it was a dog. Countless hours of research on dog breeds and money into deposits and boom stopped really caring and again got it back. Now its duck hunting. Bought all the gear that was like 1,000 that I didn't need to spend and now I have literally spent hours and hours looking at duck hunting boats that I cant afford and sending emails to dealers. With all of this going on I put the important stuff I should be doing behind these crazy impulses. Thinking this was normal but I have started to hear from friends and family that it is no where near normal. Then I have these crazy conversations and scenarios in my head all the time that I thought was normal. I have had 4859204 scenarios in class, driving, or even hanging out with friends of conversations in my head if I go to the airport or a bar and run into some famous person and play these full blown scenes in my head that are never going to happen, but its like well at least I'm prepared if it did which apparently isn't a normal thing everyone does. Then the smallest inconveniences make me so angry. Fixing my dryer last week and I dropped the screw twice trying to get it to stay and I threw my screwdriver into the wall and put a hole there. Before nursing school I seriously had like 15 jobs. Never was fired but after about a year I would get bored and move on. Nursing school has become like that. I am almost done and all of the sudden it is boring to me, I would study for hours and hours when I first started. Now I am lucky to study two days before because I will use any excuse or ""project"" to not start what I need to be doing. Classmates get mad at me for shaking my leg or tapping my pen out of not being able to sit there. Professors allow me to sit in the back of the room because there is no way I can sit for three straight hours. Does anyone else feel like this? is this normal to just be so damn impulsive all of the time."

I am not currently taking any medication, and had to be cleared to play varsity sports at my university a week ago, so had all my vitals taken (everything that needed to be done to determine I was healthy). 

I haven't been eating super well the past week, as I've had a lot of midterms (probably not as many fruits or vegetables as I should be eating, more junk food than normal etc) , and I've probably consumed more alchohol than I should have, but other than that nothing super out of the ordinary has occurred.

5’9”, 145 lbs

non-smoker, no meds

For about a month I’ve had a dull ache/tenderness in my inner right thigh that comes and goes. When it started, it was pretty constant and sometimes had a stinging rubber band snap feeling. I can feel it sometimes when standing, laying in bed, or sitting.

Four/five weeks ago I had shortness of breath episodes out of nowhere, like my throat was a straw, and inner right calf tenderness. They did an ultrasound/chest x-ray, I was fine. Calf pain went away, and the thigh pain started two days after.

Last night the pain woke me up. I just found out I’m heterozygous for Factor V Leiden (and my dad has had two blood clots), so I said fuck it and went to the ER. Ultrasound was normal. 

Advil has no effect on the pain. It’s also itchy there sometimes when I walk (but not the other leg). Is there a small chance it is a clot and was missed twice? The ER doc said it’s a muscle strain but I’ve strained muscles before and this feels different.

There’s no redness but my right thigh is slightly larger—even the skeptical ER doc noticed it."

They did a full CT scan, with and without dye, and they say it was clear. I am... a bit of a hypochondriac and worried it missed something. If it were large enough to produce symptoms this long, it would have shown up on a CT scan in some manner, right?

Ok, so I believe I was infected with HSV 1 on 10/23. Last (Tuesday maybe?) My lip was dry. I picked at it way too much. The sore got WAY worse than they ever do when I pick at my lips. But I thought I had just overdone it. Then yesterday, after it still wouldn't heal, I realized I have a cold sore. I asked the person who I kissed on 10/23 if they ever get cold sores, and he says he just recently had one pop up. Doomed. 

So since I didn't know that this was a cold sore, I wasnt taking any precautions, washing my hands frequently, anything. 

What I'm terrified of is, while wiping in the bathroom, could the virus have been on my fingers and spread? I'm absolutely terrified right now that I could have infected myself there. What is the likelihood? I really need reassurance and peace of mind right now that this isn't a common occurrence. I'm so scared. My lower stomach/pelvic region is in mild pain and discomfort- I'm not sure if I'm just experiencing that due to extreme stress. I don't know what to expect for an outbreak down there if it's gonna happen, cause everyone experiences it differently. I don't know what to do. I know it's possible, I just want to know that it's unlikely."
224,[25F] I probably need surgery but cannot afford it. What's my best option?,"Demographics: 25F, 5'4"" 120 lbs, non-smoker

Background: I have IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome) which I have tackled using dietary restrictions (FODMAP) on my own. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area for reference.

In 2016 I noticed some irritation and flaps around my anus. This was shortly after I started at a new college, and was my first time living away from family. My diet was poor, and the Dr on campus diagnosed me with hemorrhoids. While at school, I regularly saw doctors at the student health center. Some of them thought it was fissures, some thought it was hemorrhoids. 

In July of 2019 my condition significantly worsened. At the time I was on California's government provided insurance (Medi-Cal), and my Medi-cal primary care referred me to general surgery at the local public hospital. The intake cosultation was conducted by medical students, who said my hemerrhoids had advanced, and surgery was necessary. By the time the surgery was scheduled for a month later, my medical insurance changed to my father's.

Under the new insurance, I saw my Regular primary care, who sent me to a Surgeon. The surgeon believed my problem is entirely fissures. He said surgery would be ineffective, and all I need do is reduce inflammation through fiber supplements and my current dietary restrictions. 

It's at this point I should mention both me and my father are compulsive debtors/spenders. We have both gone through 12 step program for our money problems, which I am still active in. Recently I've come to think his abscense from the program, along with other behaviors may be symptoms of his compulsion still manifesting like a ""dry drunk"" (alcoholic who doesn't drink, but still exhibits addict behaviors).

My dad starts getting the medical bills for my appointments and went ballistic. The insurance only covered a small portion of the cost, leaving him with hundreds of dollars per visit in cost. This is largely due to the high deductible of the plan, combined with the incredibly small HSA provided by his new employer. He's become dismissive of my medical conditions, said its all clearly psychosomatic, and that I need to get my life together. I found this incredibly painful and avoid discussions of my conditions with him now. He has decided to remove me from his insurance in January, at which point I will go back on state provided insurance.

Unfortunately my condition has now worsened, the area has become more swollen than ever before, and I fear it may need the surgery urgently. However, I have a great deal of guilt around my medical costs, largely due to my disabilities which make it difficult to earn sufficient income. So far, my dad has been financially supporting me while I get on my feet, although he judges my mental state and physical health very harshly. I know staying close with him is bad for my self image, although right now I don't have much of a choice due to the high cost of living in California.

I don't know what our deductible is or how close we are to reaching it, so if I choose to pursue this before the end of the year, I will HAVE to talk with him. Any advice about who to go to would be greatly appreciated."
225,"Diagnosed with polyneuropathy with unknown cause. Could h.plyori cause nerve damage? If no, what could? Numerous tests done!","Basic info: Male 32 years old , height 182cm, weight 72kg, white.  
Current medications: Ranitidine 150mg/day.  
Stopped smoking a year ago, non-diabetic, non-drinker.  

Complaints: For the past 2two years weird sensations and ever-changing symptoms in left leg ONLY while sitting, in last 4 months progressed into right leg also. Latest type of pain is burning in thigh (quadriceps or/and hams and calf) manifesting only when sitting, diminishes when moving around for a while). I don’t have pain when moving around or standing, only slugishness in left leg and sensation of tight muscles.  

ENMG showed 3 damaged nerves in left leg (L4-S1) and 2 damaged nerves in right leg (L5-S1).  

Diagnosis is: distal mixed sensomotoric polyneuropathy axonal type with probably superimposed radicolupatic changes in L4-S1 left and L5-S1 right - This is translated to english language by me, I’m sorry if it doesnt make much sense!  

Neurologist said we need to find the cause before we can start some therapy.  

They’ve performed various blood exams such as:

Serotonin - normal.  
Hormones of thyroid - normal.  
Vitamin E - normal.  
Vitamin D - normal.  
Folic acid - normal.  
Prolactin - normal.  
Creatin cinase - normal.  
Glucose - normal.  
Hemoglobin A1C - normal.  
Cortisol at 8 and 4pm - normal.  
Heavy metal panel - normal.  
West Nile - Negative.  
HIV, Heptitis, syphilis and other various stds - negative.  
Borellia antibody - normal.  
MRI of lumbar spine - small perineural cyst diameter 8mm in S2 region - multiple specialists said this is nothing and incidental finding.  
MRI of brain - normal.  

Abnormal results:  
24h ‘free’ cortisol in urine - 483nmol/dU (100 -379).  
Fe - 7 (11-32) - suprising, my Fe was always normal before.  
ALT - 62 ( 12-48).  
Vitamin B12 -  721 pmol/L (141-489).   
CRP - 8.2mg/L ( less than 5).  
Leukoyctes - 10.6 (3.4-9.7).  
H.plyori found via endoscopy. Starting treatment in a few days.    

Also apart from cortisol in 24h urine, they’re doing VMA (Vanillylmandelic acid) also but results are coming in 2 weeks.

Neurologist is for now stumped and clueless about what is causing nerve damage. 

As I found out about h.plyori today and I am visiting neurologist again in 3 weeks I want to ask you if its plausible in any way that this stomach infection could cause such progressing nerve damage? 

If not, do you have any idea what could cause it?"

Some background info that may be helpful - I’ve gained about 40 pounds in the last 2 years eating out way too much because of work. I’ve run multiple half marathons over the last 10 years, and used to be relatively active. Lately I’ve been more sedentary than I’d like, but I’m starting to exercise a few times per week with the goal of getting back into running and eventually triathlons again.


I’d like to get down to 175, which would be a 50 pound weight loss. While I imagine I’ll lose some weight during the fast, that’s not my main goal. The goal is to improve my relationship with food, eliminate my addiction to sugar and caffeine, and start making healthier choices.


I plan to exercise lightly throughout the 7 days, and would drink just water, possibly with electrolytes if needed, and meditate each day. 


I do take 3 medications - 1 for anxiety, 1 for depression, and 1 for acid reflux.


I’ve done a few 24-60 hour fasts, but want to take the next step up. Is this healthy? And is it a reasonable way to start a lifestyle change?"
230,Is hydrocortisone ointment safe to use on lips? Also is this treatment a wise one for curing my lips?,"Hello,

I have over a decade battle with dry, peeling lips. It started out of nowhere in my late teens and was made to feel like it was an ordinary issue by my doc only for it to never go away and it has caused me a lot of challenges considering I work in a client facing work.  I came across a blog where the blogger wrote that their dermatologist recommended they use a  **Cortizone 10 Hydrocortisone Anti-Itch Creme ointment (which has 1% hydrocortisone anti-itch ointment)** and then apply a bag balm lip ointment. Bag Balm has Lanolin, Petrolatum, 8-Hydroxyquinoline, Sulfrate 0.3%, parrafin wax.

When I read about using 1% Hydrocortisone ointment in general, I found out that it says to consult a doctor before applying to face. It also doesn't clearly give permission to use on lips. It states to apply it externally. My concern is if I put it on my lips at night, I may accidentally swallow some of it by licking my lips unconsciously as I sleep. How dangerous is this? Off-course as a dermatologist recommended the above treatment to help cure the blogger's chapped lips, I assume it's safe to use but just wanted to ask around more. I'm also not sure but is Lanolin safe to use of dry, extremely peeling lips? I have not taken an allergy test and should but thought id follow the above treatment to see if it works before paying to see a dermatologist.

Background:

33/African/Female/  57kg/ 5ft 7

I take iron, omega 3 and vitamin d supplements daily. I also started dabbing  Corsodyl mouthwash on my lips before bed just yesterday and noticed that it has reduced the need for me to lick my lips.

General health history:  Only issues: *Blepharitis, Slight elevated anti-bodies last I checked, goiter.*

Diet: Not great and is the cause of my anemia. High in carbs, high sugar. Trying my best to clean it. I don't eat red meat/meat in general.

Water intake: Trying to get 2l daily but often fall short.

No drinking/no smoking.

I exercise HIIT  4-6 days a week for around 30-45 minutes. Just started this. Prior to this, was exercising 2-3 days a week on and off.

Happy to provide a photo if it will help. I have good days and bad days. My recent pic isn't one of the bad days but it sure isnt the good days. It shows how crust can build for no reason. I feel a need to pick the crust out but all that has ever done is expose raw skin underneath and trying my best to find another way to get it under control."
231,Lump on back? (Spot or something I should have checked?),"In the last 2 weeks (my partner says probably more) I've noticed a lump on my back (image shown below) where my spine meets my neck. It hasn't got any colouration to it and it has no head like a spot. It feels kinda hard inside but also is able to be mushy. It'd say it's about 5cm in size. Recently I have gained a lot of weight (within the last 6 months) but I think this is due to life style changes not illness. Should I see someone about it?

Edit: just to clarify I was thinking of waiting a week or 2 then booking an appointment (to see if it goes away) but I've come here to see if it could be something serious so I should go faster.

232,"16F with 1 month intractable hiccups, other symptoms (Neurologist appt next week)","**Writing on behalf of my teenage daughter. Please forgive the lengthiness of this post, this situation is kind of complicated.**

Age: 16F 

Height: 5'3""

Weight: 125

Race: White

Location: Texas

Primary Complaint: Hiccups all day long for 4 weeks

Secondary Complaints: A few other odd symptoms (see description below)

Duration: One month

Existing Medical Issues: Previous anemia due to heavy menstrual periods (resolved). Very occasional possible orthostatic hypotension, well-managed with fluids/hydration and upping her salt/sodium intake.

Current medications: Polysaccharide Iron Complex 150 mg (one per day) for managing anemia; occasional Tylenol for headaches. Nothing else as she seriously never gets sick.

Non-smoker, non-drinker, no recreational drugs

&#x200B;

**Approximately one month ago my 16yo daughter (seemingly out of the blue) began having hiccups that lasted from the time she woke up until she went to bed. At first we thought this was funny. It's no longer funny.** 

Within 24 hours of the start of the hiccups- she became extremely ill with severe headache and nausea. No fever, not dehydrated, no signs of a cold/flu (no runny or congested nose, no cough, etc.) - just severe headache and nausea.

We gave her Tylenol for the headache, but it did not work or help at all.

The headache/nausea started mid-day on a Sunday when she woke up from a nap. It continued all day and night. Upon waking the next morning, she reported the headache had lessened somewhat, so she went to school. 

Within less than an hour of being at school, she notified me that the headache and nausea were back, and that they were *""much, much worse.""* Still no fever or signs of a cold, etc. I picked her up from school, and when we got home she proceeded to vomit three times. 

The next day, she was still feeling terrible, so I took her to see the NP-C at our doctor's office. **She ran labs: CBC With Differential/Platelet, Comp. Metabolic Panel, EBV Acute Infection Antibodies, Thyroid Panel With TSH, Iron and TIBC, Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy, Magnesium, and Ferritin, Serum.**

**All lab results came back well within normal limits.**

For the next approx 36 hours, she was extremely drowsy, and mostly slept. Still hiccuping. 

After that timeframe, she said she was feeling a little bit better, so she returned to school. 

However, the hiccups were and are still happening - all day long from when she wakes up until she goes to bed. (They were also present during her headache/nausea/vomiting phase)

**After 2 weeks of almost constant hiccups, I again took her to the doctor's office**, where she was seen by the NP-C again. As there are no signs or symptoms of any kind of gastroenterology concerns or problems, it was decided to refer her for a neurology consult. 

The neuro consult is not until Nov. 14th - well over a week from today. 

We have a shared Google Doc where she has been tracking her hiccups and any other symptoms so we can share with the neurologist. She gave up trying to record every single hiccup bout as there are really are no ""breaks"" from them at all and while in class she can't write it all down anyway. 

**Other symptoms/signs include:**

\*Intermittent headaches

\*Last week one instance of a ***painful ""shock-like"" feeling that started behind and a bit above her ear (right side) traveling down her neck. lasting several seconds.***

\*Also last week, one instance of the ***same sensation but down her left arm. Described as shock-like and throbbing.***

**\*Yesterday, while relaxing and watching videos with a friend, she experienced** ***a sudden slight pain in the lateral side of her left upper thigh followed immediately by about five seconds of that leg ""twitching"" uncontrollably (this was witnessed by her friend).***

\*My observation is that she is getting increasingly more easily fatigued/sleepy with no *discernible* reason (her iron levels are fine, for instance). Just one example is her taking our dog for a short walk, and then being completely wiped out for hours afterward - this is very unusual. 

**So, to recap:**

\*Intractable, all-day-long hiccups of one month duration

\*Within 24 hours of the start of the constant hiccups she developed severe headache, nausea, and vomiting (with no fever or other symptoms besides the hiccups)

\*Handful of ""odd"" sensations such as the shock-like feeling behind her ear going down her neck, then her left arm, then her left leg (with the roughly 5-second ""violent"" twitching)

\*Intermittent headaches

\*Easily fatigued

**Miscellaneous info:** she's a straight-A honor student and it comes easily to her, she doesn't ""party"" or drink (a self-described proud ""nerd""), eats healthy (no junk foods, no sodas), and she is under no stress - enjoys school, has great friends, very close relationship with her dad and I and her brothers, she is happy and cheerful, stays active, and has no emotional or behavioral problems, past or present. 

**Her hx includes** anemia (2 years ago) from heavy menstrual periods (managed with iron supplements) and occasional light-headedness and ""near-syncope"" upon standing too quickly and, rarely, sometimes after a too-hot shower, which also started 2 years ago so that was possibly exacerbated by the anemia most likely;  according to the pediatric cardiologist that cleared her of any heart problems in the workup of this, it is most likely due to mild, occasional orthostatic hypotension which is very manageable with adequate hydration and upping her salt/sodium. 

Other than that, she is never sick - very healthy girl. 

**To reiterate, she does have an appointment with a pediatric neurologist late next week.** However, I'm getting nervous because this is really, really weird and the information out there about intractable hiccups is scant and confusing, to say the least - so I wanted to throw this out here to see if it ""rings a bell"" with anyone. 

***I am not seeking an ""online diagnosis,"" obviously! But if any physicians/medical professionals here have any ideas, insight, info, troubleshooting/how you'd possibly approach the workup, or just possible random thoughts about what kinds of issues could be in the differential for this kind of thing (or even just find this to be ""interesting""...probably not the right word) in a medical sense -  I'd be SO grateful for your feedback!***"

My earwax builds up so often that I lose my hearing several times a year for multiple days. It’s the most irritating thing on the planet. I’ve told my GP before and they always just say use over the counter ear drops. Peroxide ear drops and flushing is the only thing I’ve gotten to work but it’s still takes several days to unclog.

I’d like another solution for earwax removal or a solution to the issue in general. Doctors have only guess that I have an overproduction of earwax.

Before you ask; No I don’t use q-tips or insert anything else in my ears.

236,"M21 Feeling of hunger, dizzyness, nausea and shakyness towards the end of my fitness workout.","I have tried eating more, waiting longer after dinner until working out, drinking more water during the day and during the workout and putting on less weight in my workout. When I put on less weight it seems to be less bad. When it happens I have to sit down, eating a banana or two doesn't really help. Last time I took dextro with me and that seemed to improve the situation a bit. I'm 1.85m and weigh about 72kg. The problem has been going on for about two/three months now.

Things to note are:

* I've been lightly smoking the past couple months(about 3 cigarettes per day on average, not in weekends).  Three weeks ago I quit but the problem still persisted.
* Something I've noticed is that after dinner I eat until I am satisfied enough, but more often than not I am hungry again very quickly(30 minutes after dinner or so)"

238,[40M] Pain in the back of hand,I have a pain in the back of my right hand between the 4th and 5th metacarpals that has been bothering me for about 2 weeks and doesn't seem to be improving. Some days it is sensitive to the touch some days it isn't the pain is most apparent when my wrist is bent upward and there is pressure on my hand like you would for example pushing on something. I would classify the pain as aching 5-6/10 when it happens but doesn't hurt much if any if my hand is at rest  or strait with my arm. I haven't had any impacts to my hand and there doesn't seem to be any swelling or bruising. I'm fairly active in my day to day life so its kinda an aggravation at this point.  All my searches bring up a lot of stuff about chronic conditions which I don't think I have. Looking for answers on what it may be. Any help is appreciated.

I'm concerned no matter the outcome. If she doesn't have surgery, what will those fibroids do to her body? If she does have surgery, will she survive it?

5'6""

125 lbs.

Mexican-American

No drinking (teetotaler); No smoking; No current medications; Slight lactose intolerance

For my whole life, I have never been able to remain seated after eating a meal. Immediately after eating, just a minute or two after putting down the fork, I become extremely uncomfortable sitting down and get an urge to stand up (which I always do). I'm an adult living on my own now, but when I was a child I would always get in trouble for this because my parents considered it bad table manners. Even when eating out in public, I would embarrassingly have to stand for the remainder of the meal waiting for everyone else to finish.

The quantity of food doesn't necessarily have to be high, I get this discomfort even after a moderately sized meal. It is very often, but not always, followed by noticeable and tangible bloating.

As for my diet, I don't eat fried foods, I don't drink carbonated beverages, I eat very little sugars, I eat plenty of protein, I eat a moderate amount of carbs, I never eat trans fats, and I try my best to limit saturated fats. As mentioned, I do have a slight lactose intolerance, but I have dairy only a few times per month and take dairy digestive pills immediately afterwards.

Any advice? Is there some sort of medicine that will alleviate this?"

256,Ankle sprain still an issue. M21,"Need help on this! About a year and a half ago I sprained my ankle (at least that's what I think happened). I would say it was a moderate sprain. It happened during combat exercise and I was dragged down by my opponent. I was dragged down from behind, landing on my back, with my left foot planted in the ground, with my leg landing facing the ground inwards (if you manage to picture that). The whole side of my leg was in touch with the ground. My knee was the part of my leg that was farthest away from my head.

My ankle was not fractured, but it got blue in some spots and swelled a lot.

I used an ankle-support on it for several weeks, however my ankle did not get very much rest (as I was in the army at the time). I obviously was very limited so I did not participate as much as I otherwise would. However, compared to a normal, or recommended, ""recovery-phase"" my ankle went through a lot of stress.

Even to this day this bothers me a lot. I compensated a lot with my right leg during recovery, and I beleive that is mainly why. My hips feel stiff and almost sore, same thing with my groin. Occassionally I get a backpain just above my right hip, which makes standing up and sitting down painful (this does not happen often though). I sometimes have pain in my right knee, however this does not bother me too much. My achilles feels really stiff after sitting for a long time. Also, my left ankle feels sore when I stretch it, as well being slightly sore to the touch in some spots (not painful). All in all I just feel so much more immobile and unathletic than I used to.

Could someone please try and diagnose this issue for me? After doing some research, is it possible my posterior tibial tendon has been damaged, giving me flat feet? I had slightly flat feet before this as well, but I never had any issues with it. Quite contrary. No real injuries in the past.

Also, please recommend a few exercises I could perform to fully recover/rebuild. I really appreciate any help I can get! Feel free to ask questions!!! In advance, thank you very much.

I then had to go out and at first walking around was fine and there wasn't really any pain, until suddenly even standing on my left leg started really sharp pains in my hip again. I started having to hobble around, only using the front of my left foot to walk around.

Location of injury on index finger 


Was playing basketball when I went up to grab the ball when it jammed my index finger. It left my index finger crooked a bit above the nail at the joint. It doesn’t go back to its straight natural position. It stays bent and it’s inflamed. I went to the hospital and they took xrays amd saw no fracture or dislocation. They say I need to go to a hand surgeon ASAP because it might be nerve damage etc. 

It stays in this crooked state and I’m wondering what this can be? It’s not excruciating pain but it hurts a bit. The hospital doc told me to call a hand surgeon and I’m seeing him tomorrow. Just wondering if you guys have seen this before. Thanks

I googled a bit and it seems I have a mallet finger injury?

I also just placed two sticks side by side on the finger in order to keep it in a straight state, is this a good idea for the meantime?"

I have pretty dry skin & scalp - a symptom of Hashimoto’s. The weather got really cold really fast, so I know my skin is drying out, but I have a couple tiny “welts” with clear centers around the driest/itchy areas. I do not believe these are bug bites as I’m not sure what would even be biting me, so I wanted to know if it was typical to get bumps if your skin is dry. I’m trying to keep it hydrated but finding it difficult. Thanks!"
261,"[19F] Fourth day post over-drinking and still feeling off (fast heart rate, nausea, shakiness)","Needless to say I went overboard on Halloween (Thursday night) and drank much more than I needed to for my size (115lbs). I don’t normally drink, don’t smoke or do recreational drugs, and I have anxiety but am unmedicated. There is a history of high blood pressure in my family. The first day afterwards was brutal, I threw up everything I tried to eat & drink which was a total of 5 times. The next two days I didn’t throw up and fought through the nausea to keep food down. This seemed to be improving how I felt each day but it’s now worrying me that my heart is still constantly pounding, I feel short of breath, and nausea still comes in waves, even when I’m finally eating normally and staying hydrated. I am more stressed than usual this weekend but I don’t find that my anxiety ever caused my heart to beat like this unless I am having a panic attack. Even when my heart isn’t beating fast, it’s beating hard and I can feel it more intensely (although this is not 100% of the time). I started having diarrhea on Sunday when I started eating more food. I am also losing sleep and this is slowly becoming too hard to deal with."

I should also note that Thyroiditis runs I  the family,  and the people that had it, my maternal grandmother and my aunt, they had perfect T4 levels and it was only discovered  via ultrasound.

I was also dehydrated  a bit when I took the blood work. I had drank a bottle of water and a small ginger ale at the time. Doctor  had hard time finding veins.

So what now? Is it possible it's my thyroid? Is something else sticking out? Where should I go from here? Thanks in advance.

265,"(Female, 21) Sharp, stabbing pain on left side of neck every so often. Don’t know what brings it on but it hurts very very badly.","Hello— this is my first reddit post so I’m sorry if I’m doing anything incorrectly. 

I’m a 21-year-old female, no medications, and I have scoliosis, my only major diagnosed condition. 
For years I would randomly get this sharp, stabbing pain along the left side of my neck. Never radiated from my skull or my arm like some nerve issues tend to do— it stayed strictly within the left side of my neck. Doesn’t feel like a muscle— there’s almost always two or three distinct stabs: one mild one that tells me it’s coming on, then after that there’s one or two extremely painful ones. 

I haven’t noticed it coming on due to head or neck rotation, it seems random. 
I haven’t had them for about two years but they’ve just started coming on again. My only major lifestyle change is that I haven’t been eating very healthy lately. I’m guessing it’s either a nerve or blood issue, the pain is way too sharp for a muscle spasm. 

I haven’t found anything online and I don’t know if it’s serious or not. If anyone has any leads I’d love some help! I’m worried it might be something serious that is unchecked! 😬"

Hello all,

I recently decided to begin eating healthier and exercising.  I eat primarily the same things every day:

Breakfast: Medium banana, 1.3 cups Cheerios, 21 almonds  
Lunch: A large granny-smith apple, 2 slices 100% whole wheat toast, and a salad with 2 cups spinach, 2-3 oz grilled chicken, 1/2 of a green bell pepper  
Dinner: 1-1.5 cups red seedless grapes, and a salad with 2 cups spinach, 2-3 oz grilled chicken, 1/2 of a green bell pepper  
Snacks throughout the day: 3 sticks of mozarella string cheese, 2 clementines, 1/4 cup peanuts

My girlfriend is convinced this is not only not sustainable but not healthy to eat the same things every day.  I can stick to something better if I'm consistent with it, which is why I set it up this way.  Also, I'm trying to get in as many servings of each group as I can.  My plan is to stick to this until I reach my goal and then just go with one salad a day and change up my other meal.

The other problem I have is that there aren't many fruits/veggies I like.  I could go for some cauliflower, but there aren't any other fruits I like other than what I'm eating, or any other veggies apart from those.  I'm worried that if I try to change things too much, I'll lose motivation to stick with it.

So my question is, is it unhealthy to eat this way?  Should I work to incorporate more changes?"

Injury resulted in tripping over extension cord, but instead of falling, caught my entire body weight on exclusively left leg. Immediate pain and discoloration, but still able to walk on it. Was at least 10 pounds heavier at the time. 

Feels like in inward pain, angled towards the inside of my leg, always painful to some degree. Not particularly sensitive to touch, even less so than a conventional bruise at times. I can still walk on it without serious pain, but the pain is constant regardless. Cannot go running without extreme, borderline disabling pain. Recently felt pain ""spread"" in my knee and achillies, went to Orthopedist and saw physicians assistant, X-rays came back negative, unable to diagnose; suggests MRI if it doesn't improve in a week. The following week I'm icing it 5-6 times a day and taking anti-inflammatory. Nothing has changed in that time and the pain is still present. Posting here as a longshot before potentially scheduling an MRI."

271,"[M24] Really burnt out, depressed or extreme side effects due to long term medicine (Tegretol, Keppra & Zonegran) usage?","Okay, so the Keppra has been switched in for Briviact a month ago after a discussion with my neuro and opening up about my anxiety and mental health problems. Problems worsened when the switch happened.

To the point: this all started last year, when the Zonegran was dosed up. I was feeling weird, couldn't focus at all or I started to get really weird feelings all around my body, which would only stop if I'd close my eyes or go to a quiet place. 
Always had fatigue, anxiety, anger and memory (confusing names, forgetting how some tasks work) issues. Went to the doc, got sent to a psych, took some days off and have been told I was burnt out.

Moving on 1.5 year: recovered from the burn out (which went pretty well, started doing photography and seeing my friends again) those feelings are gone but when I started working/practicing sports again this happened: my body is starting to wrinkle now; I pee a lot (and sometimes darkbrown, sometimes whitish); feeling pain everywhere; daydreaming and reliving my past the whole time; muscle mass is disappearing; making a lot of grammar mistakes; muscles are aching a lot, can't handle big cities anymore (I freak out and forget where I am, where I need to go etc.) my knees are caving in a lot; having itches all over; loss of appetite; the chills big time; am veeeerrry thirsty, have a very dry skin; can't handle stress anymore and my behaviour is very often reckless (has been for years) and unkind to others (this is new); am losing weight; losing hair; growing grey eyebrows; having a lot of headaches; has a lot of pain around his ribcage (right lower side, front mid-low and left-mid side) having pain around my teeth and jawline a lot (doctor couldn't find anything); memory, anxiety, patience, mood, motivator and energy is even worse than before therapy.

Doctor says it's due to stress and has taken blood samples (shows multiple vitamin deficiencies and a sodium deficiency), I think the stress is due to its due to the (long term) medication and probably a depression. Self harm has been done in the past, sudden ideas of suicide (which I certainly wouldn't like to do) are starting to come up.
I'm doing everything to relax, listen to music, take walks, I'm going to the sauna, etc. But I'm only going deeper inside the black hole. Can't work anymore and living at home has become a nightmare. Some days all I can do is sleep, enjoy music or walk around the forest and it feels like I've walked around the world, that's how tired I am.

Neuro has been called if you're wondering, just want a second opinion. 

Am epileptic with PTSD; 
never drink or take drugs; 
68 KG'S; 
2*Tegretol 600 (about 10 years), 2*Zonegran 200 (4 years), 2*Keppra 500 (about 8 years & cancelled), 2*Briviact 50 (1 month);  
blood pressure has been measured multiple times, once too low, too high and normal; 
stopped smoking since 2015; 
having a real healthy diet with a lot of fruit, greens and nuts; 
Has some vitamin deficiencies + long term sodium deficiency which I did not know of until June. Am eating more salt, yet it isn't enough;
Takes Vitamin D + Magnesium supplements in the morning.
This has been taking on for more than 1.5 year. 

More background:

I've been short-term deep brain stimulated and scanned last year (during recovery), which at that time happend for the second time to see if I was eligible for neurosurgery, am not). That first time was actually the start of the 'burn out', everything started going downhill, excersice was very hard on me. 
Second time was even harder, excercising  wasn't possible anymore. 
I used to lift pretty heavy stuff before surgery (60 to 80 KG's), couldn't talk for several minutes and sometimes I've almost fainted after doing a deadlift after the first surgery. I once tried lifting again and had the flu the day after. Did get some light fainting again immediately after the excercise. Also have a hard time using my bicycle and walking when there a lot of wind."

274,"Blood in my urine for 9 months, 19F","My first ""episode"" happened last Winter. My urethra started burning when I pee, which has happened to me before f. e. after sex or masturbation but I always assumed that this is something mechanical and then it would just naturally go away. This time, though, light inconsistent burning lingered for a week. Then I saw blood in my urine and freaked out. My period had started the next day (no, that's not where the blood came from), so I couldn't do the urine tests and I decided to take UTI antibiotics for 10 days. It was gone, then in 1,5 months it happened again with the same symptoms - alight inconsistent burning, then blood in my urine. I took antibiotics again, everything cleared up and then it came back 1,5 months later.

This time the antibiotics didn't help that much. I did the tests, incliding culture, nothing of bacterial nature was found. Repeated them in a month - still nothing. Did STD tests, they were all clear except for Ureaplasma in high quantities. So I took Doxyciclin for 8 days, if anything it didn't get better, only worse.

Numerous urologists told me that it must be either cystitis or it was something wrong with my vaginal flora. Went to two gynecologists, both told me everything looks fine and I should focus on my bladder. I did a cystoscopy, it showed pretty much nothing. The doctor said smth about an inconsiderable inflammation at the bladder opening, the urethra is fine, the bladder walls are fine, yada yada. So I was told to just try to keep a diet, abstain from sex and ""try to relax"". I said ok. 1,5 months in – nothing changed.

I went to another doctor who made me do hormone levels tests, and they showed that my testosterone is pretty high, while the estrogen is on the lower side. He told me that estrogen deficiency can influence the bladder and advised to take estrogen-high BC for 3 to 9 months to try and see if anything improves. So here I am, finished my 3d month, no drastic improvements.

The only thing that keeps me from freaking out that I'm gonna die from an untreatable bacterial disease are the peculiar symptoms. I never had any fevers, bladder or back pains, frequent urinations, smelly urine. BUT there is a strong correlation between physical activity and my condition. If I walk 15,000+ steps a day, I'm certain that in the evening I'm going to burn and bleed. I stopped going to the gym, because every time I would go my symptoms would worsen. Sex and dehydration also tend to make me worse. First urination in the morning is usually fine; if I don't move a lot and sit at home for a few days it gets better, then it gets worse again, when I start moving. If it's purely mechanical, then I really don't unserstand 1.how to treat it except for not moving 2.why did the pills help in the first place. If it's bacterial, then I would probably die already (+the 5 or 6 doctors I went to could not have missed it). 

Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? It is honestly very unsettling to see blood in my pee and it's pretty unpleasant to feel the burning. I haven't come across anyone with similar symptoms yet, the doctors don't seem to help much as well."

Hi everyone, I am using a throwaway account, however I’m in need of an outside opinion. I have had stomach problems since I was in high school. I saw a GI doctor, and had dysmotility, so I took Miralax to keep me regular. I had rarely had stomach issues throughout and eventually I stopped taking it since it was giving me extra gas and I didn’t need it anymore. 

Present day,  My stomach issues resurfaced. I had heartburn and constipation. I went to one GI doctor who did an endoscopy and found mild gastritis and esophagitis back in 2018. I was prescribed protonix, while it helped in the beginning, I wasn’t seeing total relief. 

So I went to a different GI doctor who recommended me taking the GI revive, FD gard, IB Syngery and probiotics. He also wanted me to phase out of pro tonic and linzess. Furthermore the doctor wanted me to be on a diet however I have not been following accurately. Also, I did a colonoscopy along with sibo and liver testing. So far everything is clear. My current GI doctor suspects it’s IBS. While taking the new supplements I noticed an increase in weight, and I feel an increase in appetite. Is this due to my poor diet or attributable to something else? Sorry if I am not clear and thank you for your help in advance."
276,"I 17F live with near constant low level pain and discomfort and have been ignored by doctors for years with a diagnosis of ""tendinitis"""," 

So I have had for years extreme pain in my hand when writing especially in and around my thumb in my palm. I've been diagnosed with hypermobility and I apparently put too much pressure on my hands which Is why i have the pain. I started noticing pain when I would pick things up a certain way like cups. I also started having what I call flare ups where the pain would happen any time I used my hand. I was diagnosed with tendinitis around 5 years ago when I was 12, however it never went away and has become progressively worse. Everytime I hand-write I cannot write more than a few sentences without pain. After some googling I found out that tendinitis is not supposed to last 4 years and normally the pain doesn't just last for a few days then go away completely so I realized something else has to be going on. I went to 3 different doctors before I finally was given a referral to a rheumatologist for February.

In the last two years I have slowly been getting worse, despite resting my hands and arms more. I somehow got tennis elbow and golfers elbow in both elbows despite playing neither of these sports or using these muscles repetitively. I have no clue how I got these and the pain is impacting my daily life. I have had it at least 6 weeks and no clue why. My doctor told me last year to try and strengthen the muscles in my hands with squish toys etc/stress balls. This ended up causing so much pain and making things worse. My parents seem to think if I just lose weight and strengthen my core it will magically disappear. I admit im overweight at 5""8 and 170 lbs but I don't think it would cause this. I take zoloft 150mg and I don't smoke or drink or take other drugs. 

I am now also in almost constant discomfort or low levels of pain. Even just typing can be extremely tiring for my arms. Sometimes the pain for seemingly no reason will become worse and more noticable. Other times I wont feel anything unless I think about it. Normally the pain is just in my palm between my thumb and pointer finger, the base of my hand near my wrist beside my thumb joint, and in the outer sides of my wrists. These areas are also kind of purple when i'm in noticable pain but they do not swell up. The pain in my arms is because of the tendinitis which I have no idea how I got. Does anyone have any idea what this may be ? How can I get the rheumatologist to listen to me?

I'm so tired of doctors not listening or brushing it off because the pain isn't extreme. Its getting so much worse and I cannot function normally anymore. I've had to leave school due to the pain before and it is so frustrating."

----------------

A bit more then a year ago I went to my doctor because of a very nasty ear infection.  He saw the infection with his own eyes.  It was real, it was awful and the evening before I had gotten zero sleep because of it.

He gives me appropriate mediacation, tries to close out the appointment and I tell him,

'Doc.  I know what you gave me is going to work.  But, it is going to take time.  I am in a lot of pain right now.  I am an 11 on a 10 scale now.  I did not sleep last night.  I am scared I won't sleep tonight again and I need to work tomorrow.  I simply cannot afford to sit in this much pain for 20 hours waiting for this to work.'.

This made him very uncomfortable.  I felt like I had cornered him.  He asked me questions about addiction - I have none.  Except caffeine.  And jambing q-tips in my ears up to my damned knuckles (causing said ear infections).

He gives me 6 percosets.

6 months later I had done it again.  (before this gets taken off topic, I have forbidden myself from using q-tips.  No ear infections since then).  Was in with an ear infection.

I was raised that you tell the docs everything.  So I told them, 'Last night I needed a percoset in order to sleep the pain was so bad.  But I am better now.'.

Nurse runs out of the room, doc comes in, 'Where the hell did you get a percoset?'.

I replied, 'From you.  You gave me 6, 6 months ago.  Took me 3 to get through the infection.  I used 1 last night.  Have 2 more left.'.

That was 6 months ago.

Now, I want to make a few statements.  I know the internet believes everyone is lying, you just need to trust me.

1)  I have only ever asked this guy for pain relief one single time for that initial ear infection.

2)  I am very much addicted to caffeien and that is it.

3)  Since I was in High School addictions have scared the shit out of me.  I tried pot one time.  I do occasionaly drink... in the last month I have had 2 beers.  My normal is 1 every 6 weeks or so.

So, last Friday I am in for my yearly physical.  First the nurse had me sign a couple of weird forms talking about drug addiction and saying that I will only ever use one pharmacy.  Then she pulled out a cup and made me take a drug test.

My instinct was to tell her and my doctor to fuck themselves.  But I couldn't.  Because any reaction I could think of was the same reaction an addict would have.

What is the downside to this situation?  I imagine that HIPAA keeps my employer from getting wind.  Am I going to have problems finding new doctors in the future?  Am I going to have insurance problems?  Is there a way to get this off my health record without making them even more certain I am some sort of addict?"

Two months ago I started having symptoms of what I believe is anxiety but I needed some reassurance. I think I should mention that there is a pair of depression cases in my family. The symptoms i’ve been having are:

-Recurrent and sometimes intrusive thoughts
-Excessive procastinating
-Sometimes I get a feeling of losing control and getting disconnected from reality. I feel awful when this happens, I become so afraid of going crazy or something like that (panic attack?). This usually happens in crowded places or places where people are talking too much.
-I feel more exhausted and fatigued than usual, although on the inside my mind is racing quite a bit.
-Im finding it more difficult to concentrate at school and do my tasks. Im usually a very productive person but this is taking its toll on me and I feel like I cant give my 100%
-I’ve had some psychosomatic symptoms like intense tensional headaches at night and acid reflux. These lasted for like 1week each but are now luckily gone.

Im definitely feeling better since a week or so but nevertheless, I had a little panic attack today and I wanted to know if this could be anxiety or something else. Im doing good at school but the situation at my house is totally awful and I guess that’s the matter."

He will be fine during day then when he sleeps he can barely breath. Also been having really bad stomach pain and was throwing up/pooping himself but most of that has gone away. 

They’re giving him more oxygen and trying to ‘open up his lungs’, if it doesn’t work they’re taking him to ICU. Just wondering if there’s a chance he can recover, if this happens a lot, I don’t know. Anything helps. Thanks."

Race: White
Duration of complaint: 4 days
Location (Geographic and on body): right side, lung/rib area
Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): none
Current medications (if any): none

I have been having this weird discomfort on my right side in my rib area for about 4 days now. I can't tell if it is my ribs or my lung that is causing the discomfort. It's not really painful, but more like a constant dull ache, located right near the bottom of my rib cage, on the side and wrapping around the front, under my right breast. It doesn't seem to get worse when I breathe deeply or anything. It isn't necessarily causing shortness of breath, however I do feel like I have a bit of labored breathing, but I think that's because I am sitting here thinking about it all day. 

I am worried, but at the same time, I am afraid that I'm getting all worked up over something minor, since it doesn't hurt to breathe. I have an appointment with my PCP but he can't see me for another 2 weeks. I have been taking Advil for 2 days now, which helps a little bit, but not for long. What should I do?"

284,(26F) “Empty” feeling on side of abdomen?! Please help.,"I’ve had no way of phrasing this in a way where I have found a legitimate google answer. 

Basically I’ve been having this “empty” floaty feeling below my rib and towards the bottom left of my abdomen. It’s not painful, just uncomfortable. I usually put my hand there or sleep with a pillow or blanket applying some pressure to the area, and it tends to go away after. I haven’t found any correlated symptoms, but I guess this has been happening often enough for me to consistently notice it, so I thought I’d ask."

Duration and location; Inbetween 24-48 hours (I can't remember) and behind the left side of my jawline

When I first noticed the swelling it was tender when I touched it, but now it's not. I know that when it's not tender it's not a good sign and could mean something like cancer, but I don't know what to think because it was tender at first and isn't anymore. It is movable a little bit, and I wouldn't say it's hard but imo it's a bit firm. I've also got absolutely no sign of any sickness or infection. It's also got a slightly noticeable bulge, but I wouldn't be surprised if no one noticed it when they're not looking for it

edit: I should also say that I'm going to see the doctor, I'm just looking for some clarification atm in the mean time

another edit: I think I might have been a bit wrong, if the lymph node itself is the little bean feeling thing, then it's like there's a swelling underneath it, but the bean thing itself still feels a little bit firm"

287,Urinary retention associated with 20mg Escitalopram,"Hi Guys,

Im 21M, 196lbs, 6”2, and started taking 20mg escitalopram once before bed daily and 50mg hydroxyzine hcl as needed on Friday to treat anxiety. Since then, I have had extreme pain on urination, which I didn’t think much of Friday night when it began. However, it persisted, and at times, especially at night, I cannot even urinate even if I feel my bladder is full. Other times, it can take upwards of 10 minutes to do so and is accompanied by pain. I have not observed any difference in the urine itself. I read online that this is an extremely rare side effect of ssri medications but am not sure if that’s what’s going on—I’m slightly embarrassed and would prefer not to talk to my doctor about it unless I know it’s likely this is the issue and there’s nothing else going on.

Around 2 hours ago I sat on my bed and my knee locked, it locked in a position where my heel was close to my butt. My girlfriend managed to push it out to a 90° angle over the course of 30 minutes but it hurt so bad I had to stop her. I haven't been able to move it since. Any small movement hurts, even if I move other parts of my body. It's excruciating. 

This has happened before but the last time was 3 years ago, and it lasted 45 minutes. Never this long and never this painful. Since it last happened sometimes if I sit with my knee bent too long it hurts the muscle but that's it 

I don't know what to do, any advice appreciated"
289,[22M] is there a point in which I can safely say that I didn’t contract herpes,I am a 22 year old 6’ male and 2 years ago or so I had sex with a girl who soon after found out one of her ex’s gave her herpes. She told me and my life did a bit of a 180. When we were together it was not during one of her break outs. I know that makes it less likely for me to get it but not impossible by any means. 2 years later I’ve not shown any symptoms but I also don’t want to do to someone else what was done to me. Obviously I’d tell any future relations of this but is it somewhat safe to assume I didn’t contract it?

I don't have a fever, diarrhea, nausea, headache, etc. I do have slight shortness of breath and I can also cough up the mucus if I don't blow it. I coughed up a small streak of blood a while ago with some mucus but it seemed to have just been from straining my blood vessels. Doctor gave me a z-pack a month ago in case it was an infection but I waited to take it in case it cleared up and so I think I'll take it starting tonight.

292,Gynocology: Why do I (28F) have such bad cramps after getting a copper IUD,"After getting a copper IUD for 5 years about 1.5 years ago I have way stronger bleedings and 3 days of strong cramps (in the back and front) around 1-4 days before my period starts - even though i didnt have problems before.

The bleeding is okay. I dont care. But the cramps force me to lay in bed. (Every 5 minutes about 1-2 minutes cramps. Not the most fun).

I checked with my doctor but the position is fine. 

From a biological point of view: Why is my body suddenly reacting that way? Why can there suddenly be severe cramps even though it was never an issue before? What could help except for removing? (Tried ibuprofen and muscle relaxer)

293,I'm a 23 year old guy with little to sex drive,"Within the past year and a half, I feel like my sex drive has continued to gradually go down. 2 years ago I was able to have sex with my ex girlfriend  3 consecutive times without missing a beat. Now I feel like I'm done after one, and at times I can feel my self going a bit soft during that first round. 

Im honestly unsure about what may have changed during this past year and a half. Nothing about my diet or lifestyle has changed, although during this past year and a half I have been feeling a bit anxious/insecure. But that comes and goes. 

Thinking back one day I noticed myself going a little soft one day during sex, and ever since then it's something I've been a little nervous about happening again, so I feel that may be attributing to my performance. 

Recently I've started seeing this girl who I think is amazing and incredibly attractive. This past weekend I stayed with her, we had sex a few times. But last night I couldn't even get it hard. Part of me thinks it's because of how tired I was. But I think the other part is whatever the hell has been going on with me

Basically, over a year ago, after a period of heavy drinking in combination with my meds I put a lot of stress on my liver and became heavily jaundiced. I got help, it went away, **and by all indications my liver is now fine** - I have a comprehensive metabolic panel every four months or so and my bilirubin is normal. However, the yellowing of my eyes hasn't *completely* gone away- it's not immediately noticeable but I see it. It's almost like the whites of my eyes are stained or something. 

My doctor isn't concerned about it, but it makes me self-conscious and constantly kicks off paranoia that my health is dropping out from under me again (yellow eyes were the first sign I noticed when it went bad before)

Again, all tests indicate that I am perfectly healthy. A bit anemic maybe. Can anything be done to help with this specific issue?"

It's always the other person's way or there's a huge argument about it. My parents even just tell me to suck it up and just shutup or an argument will come. I like to justify everything and talk because I care about something and want to voice my opinion, but that just comes off as argumentative.

Ideally I just want to take a drug that makes me don't care about things and basically be a slave to someone. Thoughts?"

Height - 5'8""

Weight - 180lb

Duration of complaint - extended/intermittent/infrequent

Any existing relevant medical issues - many years ago spent several days in the hospital with bronchitis+pneumonia (had smoked cigarettes for a few years, rarely if ever since), supposedly diagnosed with asthma and possibly COPD (memory is foggy, parents handled everything, only treatment was in aftermath of hospital stay). Coughed so hard I tore a hole in my lung and air got out into my chest cavity.

Daily nicotine vape user for a few years, frequent marijuana smoker (several times per week) for a year or two.

These days my lungs are on the weak side but generally fine. I play adult league hockey once a week and afterwards my lungs usually feel tight and wheezy and produce phlegm for a couple hours.

**Main question** - I'm on the tail end of a cold and I've been coughing productively and regularly for a few days. I noticed sometimes when I cough fairly hard, it feels and sounds different, sort of wheezy and raspy, but more suddenly uniform in quality and tone than a normal cough, almost like some sort of flap or valve was actuated by the forcefulness of the cough, like a secondary or ""bypass"" ""mode"" of coughing, so to speak. I'm almost certain I've experienced it before, but it would have been rare, mostly because I haven't had the occasion to cough hard very often I guess. It's not painful but it feels weird and I'm wondering what's going on. 

Might it be my vocal cords getting caught in some kind of... harmonic resonance, or something? Can coughing hard in this alternate mode be more harmful than a normal cough of the same force?"

My five month HIV 1 PCR was also undetectable.I'm afraid that I might had seronegative infection. Or different strain etc. This fatigue is unbearable now. I'm too tired and sleepy all the time . I'm on bed all the time now."
299,please read these symptoms and suggest possibilities,"When I was young, around 5-7 years old, I sometimes heard a lot of voices. It sounded like a huge crowd of people, and I could never make out words, but it would make me shut my eyes and cover my ears and i would feel anxious and the world would feel like it was accelerating and slowing down at the same time. And after a bit, it just faded away. These periods would happen in the car or while i was trying to sleep. Sometimes I would also be staring at something, and then that object would look like it was coming at me while the background was receding, and then I would feel an urge to get up and walk aimlessly- and everything felt surreal and accelerated when I did. I’m almost about to graduate high school, and I have had any incidents like that since. I didn’t undergo any major childhood trauma, and my parents were strict but never did anything that would be considered near child abuse, so I’m not sure what caused this or what it was... I just know that it definitely happened. I’m not seeing any replies as a diagnosis. I just would like to hear suggestions/possibilities and then do some research from there. :)"

It comes and goes without any rhyme or reason. I’ve told my rheumatologist, dermatologist, PCM, pain management and allergy/ immunology, still no diagnosis. Also, I seem to have more joint and muscle pain than a typical Sjögren’s patient but they just claim it’s due to fibromyalgia. Help please! Any ideas or guesses are better than what I have.

301,Any ob/gyn out there can help w a question,"Can endometrioma s dissolve on their own? 

I’m 47/f in the USA.  I had a diagnostic lap confirming endometriosis 10 years ago (w ablation).  

I had a 1.3 cm endometrioma on the left side in March.  Last month on cat scan and ultrasound (regular and tvu) it showed to grow to 3.6 cm.  

The surgeon/gyn I saw today said the endometrioma is not there and that the current cyst is just a regular functional cyst.  

My pain is severe.  Constant throughout the month. Middleschmerz at times is worse.  But from ovulation to period it is excruciating.  

I can no longer wear pants.  

I don’t agree with the surgeon at all. 

He won’t do surgery or even bothered to do an ultrasound.  Offered an iud and said since I’m close to menopause I don’t need surgery.  

So what are the chances an endometrioma ruptured without me knowing and it replaced with a functional cyst."
302,Bounding Pulse and Racing Heartbeat,"So last night I laid down in bed to go to sleep as usual and routine for a Sunday evening. About 45 minutes to an hour later, I was half asleep and was jolted awake and alert by what I think was a bounding pulse and racing heartbeat. Some of my symptoms included:

very intense pulse. It felt like I could feel my legs and arms throbbing.

red/warm skin

racing heartbeat

weird cotton mouth feeling, although not dehydrated

I did not check my bpm. I have never experienced this sensation before, and was quite worried. After calming down, I tried to go back to sleep, and an hour or so later the same thing happened again. It got to the point where as soon as I'd lay still I'd feel the same sensation occurring again. I thought maybe this was a panic attack, low/high blood pressure. I have no idea though.

Some details about me:

(M) 25 years old. 6'1ft 230 pounds.

I have had no change in diet, medication, or lifestyle

I do not have diagnosed anxiety

I do not have any diagnosed health conditions regarding my heart, blood pressure, or anything like that"
303,[27M] Cardiovascular Tightness,"After drinking most of a Koia chocolate banana protein shake, I felt symptoms I have felt many times in the past couple of years but tried to ignore them because every EKG or consult says my heart is fine.

It starts as a sensation of blood flowing in the veins of my limbs, as if my blood was replaced with sugary syrup that allows me to feel it. Then I get a tightness in my left cubital fossa, then in my right arm, and then in my chest. I also feel muscle contractions in my thighs. The tightness isn't quite bad enough to describe it as a ""squeezing"" but it does get worse over time and it has progressed to that threshold before. The tightness is located deep inside the middle of my chest. This is paired with shortness of breath, especially when trying to talk. I've had many anxiety attacks before, but I didn't feel anxious when the tightness onset. Symptoms gradually subside over an hour.

EKG was normal as these symptoms began subsiding. Any past EKGs were normal.

Recent MRI of aorta didn't show anything of concern.

Notable history:

About 3 weeks sober from a multi-year Klonopin regimen (low dose of 0.25 mg the last year+). Been feeling clarity & barely any anxiety like I used to have but a lot more pain.

Lymph nodes were bothering me for a month+ but I didn't feel them for the past 2 weeks.

Glucose relatively normal on any blood tests I've gotten, but I haven't had blood drawn during these symptoms.

Keep getting strictures in my esophagus.

38-degree curvature of spine causes lots of back pain; began treatment with anti-inflammatory lifestyle & NSAIDs."

I enjoy smoking as just a fun pass time, but it somewhat scares me when I feel my pulse and it's faster than normal, but I do know THC increases your heart rate. So I guess what I'm asking is when should I be worried about a heart rate and when should I hang up the bowl for good, or should I just brush it off as a side effect of marijuana?"
305,"24 female, multiple joint pain, fevers & fatigue","Hello! I am at my wits end trying to get a diagnosis & could use some opinions from fresh sets of eyes. 
I am a 24 year old female & about 3 years ago I started getting pain and swelling in my hands (particularly between the knuckles of my index and middle fingers). I didn't think much of it at the time as I was a student and constantly writing. After a few months it went away, but when it resurfaced that summer, my knees were also painful and swollen. I went to a doctor & had normal xrays, ultra sounds, & MRIs (the only abnormality was synovitis in my knee)& blood work for Lyme disease came back negative. I was sent to a rheumatologist who considered Lupus or RA & ordered blood work done. The blood work came back mostly normal- the only abnormality being a *slightly* raised ANA (1:80 homogeneous pattern).  He said he would not rule out something like early lupus but (understandably) could not justify making a diagnosis at this point. He recommended going to another rheum for another opinion (which I absolutely will) but I also figured it couldn't hurt to reach out to this subreddit to see if this sounds familiar. Is there anything we might be missing that we could look into? 
Some other things my Drs have asked about that might be significant:
Symptoms are not constant, but come and go seemingly at random.
I have a significant family history of autoimmune diseases 
I sometimes get rashes from being in the sun and it can absolutely drain my energy. 
I get mouth sores rather frequently. 
I frequently run a low grade fever. 
When I am in a period of symptoms acting up, the fatigue REALLY kicks my ass. 
My wrists, elbows, and knees are all hyperflexible but I have never had an issue with dislocations or anything like that. 
My fingers and toes cannot handle the cold anymore. They go white and numb even if it's just a little chilly. 
Now, in addition to my hands and knees, my hips and elbows are also involved with the pain (though they don't seem as bad on the swelling front)

I have been to about half a dozen doctors and every one is stumped. If anyone has any suggestions that I could bring to my rheum, I would very much appreciate it! I would also be happy to answer any clarifying questions. 
Thank you!!"

I have been dating my current boyfriend for 2 months. Ever since we have been having sex (unprotected.. yes I know, I know), I've bled after sex. Not every time, but a significant amount of times. I've had a PAP where the doctor took a look in there in general for signs of warts or other traumas etc and found nothing. I was also tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea, and the tests were negative.

My ex was larger in general and I've never experienced bleeding. This person also assaulted me a couple of times, and even then I didn't bleed. We had different kinda of sex, in many positions, and also from gentle to very rough. Again, nothing. Same with the boyfriend before.

I'm not sure what would change this time and I'm pretty frustrated about it. Any ideas?"
307,Take great care with my oral hygiene but sometimes I taste bad breath after I take a drink?,"I am a 34M, white, been having this problem as long as I can remember, even before my 450 mg daily trileptal (treats my BP 2). I get my teeth cleaned twice a year. I brush and floss and use mouthwash twice a day. I have a really nice tongue scraper I also use twice daily. In general, my breath is fine. But sometimes, as I take a gulp of a drink (soft drinks or water) I will get the telltale taste of bad breath in my mouth. 

I don't see any tonsil stones. Could this taste be coming from my nasal passage or something? I don't feel like it's from my stomach either. And I have been drinking more water the past couple of weeks to hope it solves the problem but it doesn't.

What could be the cause?"
308,[23M] Possible Radial Nerve Damage by Compressing Elbow,"Height: 5’8” weight: 145lbs medications: none smoking: no drinking: yes 

Last night I had a long flight and managed to get an entire row to myself. Since I wanted to try to get some sleep on the flight and take advantage of the room I had, I leaned my back against the side of the plane and put my legs up on the other seats in the row.

I wasn’t paying much attention to where I placed my arm, but I assume I must’ve been pressing my elbow against an arm rest, and so possibly pinching my radial nerve. When I woke up after some time, my thumb and index finger on my left hand were numb and limp. I was a bit panicked, so I can’t remember if my wrist was also drooping. I could flex and extend my fingers, but it took a considerable amount of effort and I probably wouldn’t been able to hold it in those positions for long.

Absolutely terrified of loss of function in my dominant hand, I did what seemed most rational at the time: shook the hell out of my arm until my hand went back to normal. After less then two minutes of terror, my hand did go back to normal, albeit with some pins and needles and residual weakness, but extension and flexion were much easier. This morning there are practically no residual symptoms.

I’ve heard of a condition called Saturday Night Palsy, and I think my symptoms resemble that pretty well, however nearly all my research seems to indicate that the main way that it happens is nerve compression under the armpit rather than the outside of the elbow. So I guess my first question is: Based on the symptoms and cause, is it likely I came close to giving myself Saturday Night Palsy? Also, based an my symptoms and how quickly they went away, is it possible to estimate how close was I to potentially long term or even permanent nerve damage? Finally, is there anything I should be concerned about in the next couple days, or anything I can do to prevent this from happening again?

Thanks in advance for all answers and let me know if there is need for anymore information or clarification!"

Since then I don’t notice it but when I layed down last night I noticed a hard lump in my neck. On the right side.  Could a lymph node swell from that?

I went to the doctor this morning and she essentially dismissed it and said it’s probably due to the bite and follow up if it doesn’t go away in a week, but I’m still terrified haha.

I will say about one year ago I got a CT scan and ultrasound  of my neck to check for any suspicious node / lump or anything due to some ear issues I was having and nothing was found.

The doctors closest to me only have an open appointment in 10 days, which is enough time for me to convince myself I have 13 cancers and 47 blood clots. These lumps are around the size of a 10p coin and are completely painless. They only appear when I’m standing and can be pressed without pain. Any advice?"
313,"I decided to test for thyroid, believing it is hypothyroidism. Consulted a doctor and he said it's a very rare case. Feeling confused. Thank you for your help.","I'm 27 years old, male. I was used to weigh high always even though I don't look as much as I weigh. I am 6' tall and now my weight is 115kg. Just a quick recap of weight - 

2009 - 83kg

2013- 90kg

2015 - 108kg (Then I started to exercise, on and off and on and off)

April 2017 - 89 (Good body physique). Then I had a small accident and my arm got a few stitches. Nothing serious at all. But I lost the discipline and haven't exercised properly since then. 

Now I weigh 115kg (Was 118kg till 2 months back, then I started to manage my diet.)

These last few days I have been trying to lose weight (Though I haven't really exercised) but I was thinking I don't eat bad food so it shouldn't have gone up anyways. Today I decided to check my thyroid levels.

T3 - 0.4 ng/mL

T4 - 1.8 ug/dL

TSH - 3.84 uIU/mL (11AM).

I thought it looks clearly hypothyroidism and I was expecting it. I decided to consult a doctor.

He checked my blood pressure and it was 160/100. A bit high. 

Now he is saying it may be genetic and I should check FT3. If it's normal then there's nothing. Then he said I should get my testosterone and hormones levels tested. And then he mentioned some disease that we should check I don't have it. He mentioned TSH should've been higher around 150 to confirm hypothyroidism.

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to attach the prescription here.  I don't want to take these tests. I am scared. And I know my lifestyle has been bad and I believe I can fix it all by correcting my lifestyle and losing weight. I don't want to get dependent on medicines. 

I'm thankful for any advice that I can get.

Thank you."
314,Advice on my spleen ultrasound? UPDATE FROM LAST POST,"24F. 5”3. 122lbs. White/British.

I made a post asking advice on why my doctor had referred me to hematology for an enlarged spleen.

I wanted to update and ask advice from what I learned.

I went to a scan on 16th October and got given these results:

https://imgur.com/a/c1KaDRz

My spleen measures at 9.3cm.


I went to a scan on the public health on 31st october that my doctor referred me to. The results came in to my doctor’s office at 12.1cm and i was referred to hematology for an enlarged spleen.


My partner was confused at how my spleen size could change in that time so ordered another private scan on 2nd november. My spleen measured at 9.7cm and she said it doesnt seem ‘bulky’ (as my doctor stated) at all. 
Here is the report: https://imgur.com/a/7sjcIWU


When I found out today that my public health scan was 12cm my partner ordered one last ultrasound today and my spleen is 9.5cm. The sonographer said she cannot believe I’ve been referred to hematology and no wonder the NHS Is going bankrupt! She has been a sonographer for 28 years and my spleen is absolutely fine.

Here is the report and photos:
 https://imgur.com/a/cZjDdjk

Sex: Female
No prior medical history

Swollen lymph nodes—hard/rubbery, wax and wane, night sweats, fatigue, significant weight loss, itching, back pain etc. All other blood tests came back negative for everything. Only thing was lymphocytes out of range. Already tested for RA but that came back neg as wel but for this my IGA was elevated though other factors on the test weren’t. Cardiologist ordered echo, stress test and monitor for tomorrow. He said it may be lymphoma and best bet is to see oncologist/hematologist. I had a neck ultrasound 10/31 and results came in Friday and I should get a call today from what the Dr’s assistant said! Any help with this blood test result?

317,I'm falling asleep too easily.,"20F 
Height: 1.63m 
Weight: 70kg 
Race: Chinese 
Primary Complaint: Falling asleep too much 
Duration: few months
Smoking: No 
Drink: No 
Recreational drug use: No 

Most of my life, I'm able to fall asleep on bus rides, long car rides, in boring classes, etc
I've just entered university around 3 months ago. Since then, the ""rate"" of me falling asleep has been getting quicker and quicker. I would take less than 5 minutes to fall fully asleep after hitting the bed. I'm also able to fall asleep almost anytime of the day too. I'm always very tired even after just getting out of bed. 
I'm also usually able to get 6-8h of sleep everyday as well without any disturbance. 

I've been diagnosed to take anxiety and depression tablets for a short while (in Sep for 2 weeks)and have since stopped as I was unable to follow up my doctor due to busy schedule. 

Is there anyway I can do to help reduce this form of tiredness? It's beginning to hinder my schoolwork as well."
318,PVFS and Glandular Fever/Mono,"Hi,

I came down with Glandular Fever when I was at University (I am 19M), no idea how I got it but c'est la vie right? I didn't have any major debilitating issues at that time, just felt pretty feverish for a month but I continued to train (I am a bodybuilder) and continued to live my life as normal as I felt I could. Beginning of October, a month ago, I woke up one morning after having a few days of feeling pretty decent as I withdrew from University as I felt as though the whole thing wasn't right for me, and could barely get out of bed. My eyes were so heavy, my legs weak and shaky, my mood very low and my brain completely fried (this had been around for a few weeks prior) and so far, 4 weeks later, none of these symptoms have improved. 

I feel like my entire life is on hold, and from what I read I think I am dealing with PVFS, which has a relatively good prognosis, but could well turn into CFS/ME which does not. Currently, I have good days/hours and bad days in terms of mood and energy, most of them bad. I can manage a 3km/2mile walk on most days, but I am not lifting which in turn is stressing me right out but I know this is most likely for the best at this time.

Diet is pretty sweet, I take D3 and Zinc every morning, eat lots of Fruit/Veg and consume around 2800kcal per day resting, which is my caloric need so I maintain weight on that. I sleep 9 hours a night but don't feel at all refreshed afterward. I think because of the seeming lack of improvement in my condition, I am becoming quite demoralised and anxious that I will be like this for a long while. 

Would appreciate some words of wisdom/sound medical advice on how I can get over this godforsaken thing! Playing Fallout 6 hours a day was fun while it lasted, but I am really looking to get back to my old life.

Cheers,

J."

320,(45F) Itchy rash on chest and crushing fatigue,"Background

I’ve got a host of physical issues and take a lot of medication, but nothing has changed with any of that so I’m not going to detail the whole thing. One chronic illness I have that *may* be worth mentioning is ankylosing spondylitis and I take an immune suppressant called Enbrel, which makes me more susceptible to contagious illnesses. I’m generally home bound (work from home) but I was at a party two days ago among 30 people or so and a few children and two cats. 

Current issue

For the last 3 days I’ve had debilitating fatigue, to the point where I’m sleeping 14-16 hours a day. Even when I am awake, I can barely keep my eyes open. The only other thing I’ve noticed is a slightly itchy rash on my chest that resembles heat rash (though I’m not overheated).

It reminds me a lot of how I felt when I had mono as a teen, minus the sore throat. 

I live in Europe, and I haven’t had contact with any flora (i.e. outside in wilderness or something). I have a dog, but have never had an issue with him. I have a mild cat allergy and was slightly affected by my exposure at the party but just the usual runny eyes and sneezing."

322,My feet hurt when I wear any shoes but flip-flops,"34M, 190lbs, 5'8"", white, social drinking

For a couple years I've had pain across he middle of my feet (arch, outside edge of foot) , especially my left foot, when I wear shoes and walk for more than a short time. The only shoes that seem to not cause the issue are flip-flops. I've tried Dr Scholl's inserts and arch compression bands but they haven't worked.

What is the best path to fix this: specific shoes, devices, exercises?"
323,Hair on head suddenly growing really fast? [18F],"Okay, so, this is less of a concern and more of a curiosity that I cannot quell through Google searches. 

The hair on my head (NOT facial hair) has always grown pretty fast. I was born with a full head of hair and by time I was 3 it was down to the bottom of my back. It's kind of ironic because I barely grow hair anywhere else and even have never grown armpit hair, but that's besides the point.

For the past few months the hair growth has accelerated quite a bit. I dyed my roots two weeks ago and already have about 1 cm of re-growth, maybe more. It used to only grow that much every month to a month and a half.

So I'm wondering what the possible causes are. My best guess would be hormones?

I'm 18, female, 5'2. My known medical conditions are anorexia, leukopenia, iron-deficiency, and GERD, but that's about it. My mom has adrenal gland + kidney issues and I think too much testosterone, so there may be a hereditary component?? 

Or maybe my body is preparing for hibernation haha. Winter is coming up, hmmm."
324,Possible Concussion,"Hi,

Last week Tuesday I was thrown over the shoulder unexpectedly in wrestling practice. I landed on my side completely but when I made contact with the ground I blacked out for a second. I am 250 pounds if that helps visualization. I didn't think I had a concussion (stupid of me) and I continued on. I also stupidly played basketball Friday of last week as well where I took a couple of hits to the head and body. Now I have had a little headache for a couple days in the back of my head behind my ear. I am really afraid I did some damage or caused CTE and this is causing a lot of anxiety as well. It also doesn't help that for the past month I have been doing research on CTE for a presentation I guess. I also feel that I am cloudy in my thinking and that I have some cognitive deficits. Will the hits have a lasting effect on me? When can I return to wrestling/basketball? Do you think I need to go in for an actual check up and what type of doctor does that?"
325,How worried should I be about my ovarian cyst?,"I went for my yearly and my gyno ordered a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm IUD placement, as I've had weekly bleeding with my Mirena for months. 

During the scan they checked my ovaries as well and one looked like it was covered in big spit bubbles. I didn't hear back from my doc, but the office emailed my results (dictated by the doc). 

My right ovary has ""Enlarged--complex--loculated cysts--largest=3.6 x
3.5 cm... Vol(ml): 61.5."" I called in and they said the doc would have to call me back later this week. 

Everything I've looked at online points to ""not good"" and the doc has always gotten back to me within 24 hours after other ultrasounds. On a scale of one to ten, what is a reasonable level of worry?

Edit: I am 34, no children, and no family history of cysts."

Height: 6'3""

&#x200B;

So a couple of years ago, while getting a routine physical, I found my eGFR was a bit low at \~72.  A bit concerned, I waited 4 months, had it rechecked, and the number went up to 81.  Earlier this year, I had it checked again at another physical, and it was now up to 90.  However, 2 months ago, at a mandatory physical for my workplace (that's not tied to the usual one I have), my eGFR dropped down to 65.  Is there something that causes all these numbers to bounce around?  I will say that about 2-3 days before my workplace physical, I had consumed a rather large steak (a farewell dinner for a friend), but I wasn't expecting such a precipitous drop.  At this point, which number should I be looking at?  Any help would be appreciated!"

This is particularly noticeable when I have earphones plugged in (but nothing is playing). But I can still make the sound out otherwise. 

I don't hear this when I have my jaw tightly clenched, or I have my lower jaw shifted to the side at a weird angle. It doesn't feel remotely life-threatening, or even particularly harmful, but the thought that there's a bone fragment bouncing around somewhere inside my head has been unsettling the crap out of me for a week.

I'm wondering if this is something other people have experienced, and what the likely cause is."
329,Randomly Choke on Own Saliva [28 F]," Female

Age: 28

Height: 4' 10.5""

Weight: 135 lbs

This has happened several times already but the most recent episode was the scariest. I was sitting on my bed, looking at my phone when all of a sudden I start choking (I wasn't eating or drinking anything). As I said, this has happened to me several times so I try to drink some water (it has helped in the past) but this time it wasn't working. I rush to the kitchen and lean over the sink. I start giving myself the heimlich maneuver (Hoping to get whatever is in my throat out). By this time my dad is rubbing my back helping me breathe. I finally manage to breathe, but only a bit. It was like trying to breath using only the stuffed up nostril when you are sick.

I have gone to a throat doctor. He has concluded that my vocal chords were inflamed and he stated that it was most likely a combination of my allergies and nasal dripping going down my throat while I sleep that has caused it to become this way. Now I take nasal spray at least 4 times a week (once/twice a day) and occasionally take allergy medicine. (I was told after a couple of months to use when needed so that is my schedule).

I’m not sure if there is anything more to this or if this is a real thing that happens to people. I feel like I am the only one that happens to.

I am not doubting my doctor’s diagnosis but I am wondering if there is more to it."

So he said I have no heart or lung problems so maybe I have gas trapped in my chest so after his medication my chest pain decreased but on Thursday night I got a really bad heartburn after eating a meal which had garlic and I slept somehow and the next day I went to the doctor and he gave me antacids and gastric medications and it has been 3 days my heartburn is not yet gone it has reduced but it is still there.

Problem- I have a large and very inflamed cyst on my cheek near my ear.  I had had a tiny cyst there since my teens that would sort of come and go with my cycle.  A week to 10 days ago it suddenly flared up and swelled to the size of a walnut with shell (imagine gluing a large walnut to your cheek and stretching your skin over it).

It hurt like hell.  So I went to urgent care as they said they would lance it for me.  Show up, pay $150 for them to tell me they wouldn’t touch it as it’s on my face.  IDGAF about scarring, by the way.  A scar is a lot easier to conceal than this gigantic goiter on my face.

So I was able to get in to see a dermatologist to tells me the cyst is abscessed but they won’t touch it until the inflammation goes away, and prescribes me the antibiotic and has me make an appointment in 2 weeks to see where we are.  That was on Thursday.  

They also admit that the antibiotic will likely do nothing as the cyst walls aren’t connected to my blood stream.  So I don’t know what the point is of this antibiotic, but I’m taking it anyway.  They told me that if the inflammation isn’t gone they will give me a shot.  

Since then, it has gotten bigger and the pain is becoming intolerable, not to mention I can’t go anywhere as it’s so incredibly unsightly.  My ear and jaw hurt really badly.  I can’t chew.  It is getting dark red/purple in one spot, and the skin is starting to peel there too.  

I’m using warm compresses trying to get it to come to a head.  Is this ok to do?  The dermatologist made it sound like breaking it was dangerous because of infection.  But I can’t go on this way.  It can’t sleep.  He made it sound like it needed to heal from the inside out, but everything I’ve googled says that cysts don’t heal this way because of the cyst wall, and they the only way to heal a cyst is to drain it and then remove the cyst wall.  

I’m about to take a couple shots and then use a scapel on myself.  What can I do?  The dermatologist is like, yeah it is extremely painful and yeah, it’s extremely noticeable but there is nothing they can do."
335,"15yF, fatigue, stomach pains, body aches, tunneled vision when standing","My 15 year old daughter started complaining of symptoms about a month ago.   We took flu and strep tests, both negative.   She was diagnosed with a sinus infection and given antibiotics, but never really felt much better.  

She is currently on a low dose of birth control for cramps and a generic Prozac for anxiety.  

Since then, she's had blood work.  It came back clear except for low levels of Vitamin D.   She also tested positive for mono, but the nurse said her mono levels are low and it looks like she had it a while ago and she shouldn't still be feeling that badly.  

An x-ray showed something odd on her appendix, as well as another spot.   They sent us for a CT, which was clear.  The doctor wants another x-ray.  He said he is not as concerned about the stone (I guess in the appendix), but there's something else he wants to keep looking at.  The nurse said almost like she swallowed a piece of metal as a child?!?

She is a freshman in honors courses and plays JV volleyball and is a varsity cheerleader.  The transition to high school has been challenging, but she is handling it. She says it doesn't feel like anxiety or depression, except she will get a little anxious about being sick for so long and missing things, etc.

I was helping her clean out her back pack and she said lifting her folders out of it felt so heavy.   She also says sometimes her fingers kind of tingle like they're asleep, and today she has a new complaint: her vision ""went black except for small circles"" when she stood up.

A few months ago i got pain in my arms that was diagnosed as tendinitis. It comes and goes but can get pretty bad, and it started after playing video games frequently. It then started happening in one leg as well, and it gets inflamed after work from standing on it and locking my knee on that side, but the Dr. claims its just tendinitis. I also have muscle twitches all over my body, mainly in my arms and legs and eyelid. And now my joints are all cracking and popping. No real pain with the joints other than the arms and one leg with the tendinitis.

Another weird thing that happened to me is i passed out a few weeks ago and thats never happened and hasn't felt anywhere close to happening since, I'm not sure if this is something to be concerned about but my Dr. didn't seem to think so.

Now my upper back is stiff and i need my back cracked. Could some of these symptoms just be stress? Should i be worried about ALS or MS? I don't take any meds and I'm a college student so my sleep schedule and diet is admittedly pretty bad and I'm under a lot of stress all the time. I think my anxiety is making this all worse but im not sure if im wrong to be anxious about all this or if there's actually an underlying issue.

A heating pad is helping my back and braces help my arms and my one leg is actually getting better but the stress of it maybe being something worse keeps me up at night and its tearing me apart. Is there any supplements i should take or anything i should add to my diet that would improve these symptoms?

Me and my friends went dancing for the day(I took it really slow) and I ended up taking another Genpaine before going again.
Sunday was exactly the same, the pain was not as extreme but it was still unbearable so I drank another genpaine. 
I checked to see if I feel the two strings that night and I could barely feel them(could only feel the ends of the string and only one of them, not both). 
It's Monday and my pain still hasn't improved. I started bleeding this morning and I had to drink another Genpaine because I feel like I can't walk at work.

This morning I skipped a step while walking down some stairs and landed on my left ankle badly, with my feet turning inwards. And there was quite a audible POP/Snap sound. At first i can't really put weight on it but was able to walk without much limp after awhile, I'm not sure if it's due to the adrenaline. My ankle began to swell, but only around the ankle bone, the swell was hard at first and is now tender, it doesn't hurt when I touch it but it does when I press on it.

I was able to walk with a little bit of limp after work. Have been experiencing pain (4 out of 10) when walking and weaknesses and seems like a bit of numbness. There is a clicking sound once in a while when I walk, sometimes my ankle feels stuck, and only become unstuck with a clicking sound when I walk differently. Clicking doesn't hurt, a bit of discomfort at first then slight relieve.

Currently, ankle and rotate slightly but the area behind my achilles tendon hurts when I point my feet downwards.

Also have been feeling something warm flowing to my feet, as if I block my blood supply and letting it go.

How do I know if I've torn a ligament or fractured my ankle, especially with the Pop/Snap sound when I fell? Mostly afraid of needing surgery."
346,Bruises on my left arm (15M),"So last week my friend hit me on the upper side of my arm, it was really strong. It hurt at first but then it stopped. I checked the whole week for anything but there was nothing. When I got in the shower today, I noticed blue/yellow bruises on the same spot he hit me on, they were shaped like circles. What do I do now? I think applying ice wouldn't be sufficient since the injury happened a week ago."

I am:

No medical conditions

Currently under the weather with a mild cold 

Sorry for the graphic detail but I do feel it is relevant!

This morning I went to the toilet as usual, with no issues. Approx 2 hours later I had some mild discomfort and felt the need to go again. I did so and had some loose stool, but not what I’d call diarrhoea. 

When I wiped the first time, the paper was quite dirty (as you’d expect with loose stool) and was also pretty damn red. A bright/slightly purple red. I was naturally a bit taken aback by this so I checked the toilet and the contents was normal, nothing that I could see was in any way red, neither was the water.

When I wiped the second time, the paper was still fairly dirty but there was no absolutely no redness at all. It was a completely normal colour. :S

I cleaned up and experienced no further blood at all? 

I’m not sure whether this is worth a trip to the doctors? 

I do occasionally experience blood at the end of my wiping, perhaps where things are sore or maybe I have piles or something, but nothing like this!

Would appreciate anyone’s input on why there could be such a stark difference between the first wipe and the second and whether this is worth further investigation.

349,Fracture in my fifth metatarsal,"Hi, I'm a male sports player, in good physical condition and 18 years old and about 187cm and 83kg. I have fractured my fifth metatarsal about 7 weeks ago, and was in a full non weight bearing cast for about two weeks then have been in a boot since. I have used crutches while using the boot for about three more weeks then have started to bear my body weight on it as it does not hurt at all. I have a volleyball tournament this weekend and is very important to me. I have gotten another Xray however no diagnosis as they were not a specialist and it looks like not much has changed since the injury. As long as it does not hurt, is it okay to play sports with an unhealed fracture? I mean what is stopping me from playing as long as it does not affect how I perform and I do not experience any pain? Also I have continuously been doing light exercises to prevent muscle atrophy since the doctor initially told me it would take from 6-8 weeks for it to heal. What do you suggest I do?

350,27M unknown throat pain and nausea,"Roughly 4 weeks ago, I got ill. Started my morning that day very light headed and on my way to work, I turned around and went home. Had a really painful throat, felt swollen and it removed my appetite. 4 days later, I went to my doctor, who concluded it is a throat infection and it would last up to two weeks.

Next week, I thought it was mostly over and went back to work, but just a day later, I felt just as terrible again. No concentration, no hunger, only wanting to lay down or take a hot shower. Went back to my doctor, who now suspected I might have Pfeiffer. Blood tests however resulted in nothing special. So the final advice I got, based on my work, is stress related. I mis-use my throat due to stress and it in turn results in nausea, lack of hunger, lack of concentration ect. No further advice how to actually improve it besides taking it slow..

I took the previous two weeks slow and steady, trying to eat healthy foods to get my system recovering. Things looked like they were going the right way, but the past few days, I've been feeling the same again like before.

In short how I feel:

- Throat feels a bit swollen, almost like as if someone is pressing it. Breathing is uncomfortable and I constantly feel the need to swallow or burp
- Lack of attention or concentration.
- No interest in food whatsoever. I basically force myself to eat something, but I feel like puking (never did so far though). I already avoid sharp foods, like coffee / onions / lemons ect. But I just can't get myself to forcifully finish an entire meal...
- Constantly a 'full' feeling, hence why I need to force myself to eat, because I know I'm not full at all. I can't even get anything down during breakfast.
- Constantly feeling to do something else to distract. Like go outside for fresh air, once outside I want to go inside again to sit down. Once I sit down, I walk to the kitchen for some water ect ect. 
- Most things that help (massaging throat, taking a shower, laying down, drinking water, eating licorice) all are temporary. Half an hour later, feeling returns.
- If I use my voice a lot during the day, I feel even worse in the evening.
- Sleeping surprisingly goes fine, when I lay down I can fall asleep fairly normally.

I don't know if this could be anything medical related, since my blood tests didn't show anything strange (they did check things like my kidneys and liver if I recall correctly). Got no medication for this as well, doctor only adviced me to take some Ibuprofen or Paracetamols, as they should help with muscle tension

I'm 27 years old, have no medical records whatsoever, weigh around ~80 kilos and am around 195cm tall. I feel like I'm just doing something wrong with my body, resulting in the mess of issues that all tie together. But the strange thing is I never changed anything over the past two years..

I wonder if anyone has something I could try which could be that one miracle solution. I find it very difficult to cope with, family and friends all kinda laugh at it, being a ""man illness"" and at work people kinda just hate that they need to take all my work."
351,Basic Question About Foreskin,"So I recently discovered that I most likely have phimosis (foreskin only barely goes past my urethra) which prompted me to inspect my penis further. I noticed that the only thing that seems to be preventing my foreskin from moving down is an attachment of my foreskin to the head of my penis on the underside of the head right near the urethra. This is not normal right? Like its a skin bridge that is connecting my foreskin to my penis head, it looks like it shouldn't be there. I have tried to research this and come up with nothing. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I am 18 years old."

Cut forward 2 weeks, bruising is virtually all gone but now where it was remains a nearly rock hard lump that won't go away. Tried Ice, Hot water etc... but it doesn't seem to be going down! Any idea what I can do to get rid of it? Hope the picture shows how much it protrudes & I can kind of 'move' it around under the skin if I push on it too so idk if knowing that helps.

It's currently been 5 weeks after my risky encounter but this problem I'm about to post happened 6 or 7 days after said encounter. A few weeks ago my left jaw was swollen. I'm not really sure if it was a swollen lymph node or salivary gland because according to my Google searches they're overlapping. Basically it's like that skin under the ear. It sometimes hurt when I turned my head to the left and also hurt when chewing. It lasted for 2 or 3 days.

My question is, is that a symptom of HIV (not even a week has passed but that showed up) and 2. is that a swollen lymph node?

356,24F: Pain in hands when gripping yoga strap,"Hi all, I recently started practicing yoga and noticed something strange with a specific position (depicted here: [https://www.yogiapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hand-big-toe.jpg](https://www.yogiapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hand-big-toe.jpg)). Whenever I grab the strap and pull it in this specific position, I experience an uncomfortable level of pain in my hands (I'm not able to hold on for longer than 15 seconds without having to let go). 

I asked my instructor if I'm supposed to experience any pain but she says that it's unusual and there is probably something wrong with the muscles in my hands. I've actually noticed this pain before, for example a couple of months ago when I was carrying a large flat piece of cardboard with a similar grip. I thought this might be something normal, but  now that my instructor confirmed this isn't expected, I'm a bit worried.

I'm a full-time developer, so I do spend a fair amount of time typing and think my grip pain might be related, but I've had trouble finding any info about pain that appears specifically when gripping things."
357,"Tinnitus in my right ear, unable to pop that ear as well","21M, 160 pounds, 5 foot 9, don't drink or smoke, formerly took Omeprazole for my Acid Reflux but have stopped taking it since developing this ringing in the ears.

Hello, I have had tinnitus in my right ear since mid October. It has, for the most part, gradually gotten a bit quieter since then, but the volume level still fluctuates throughout the day and it is often fairly loud. However, in the mornings, I can hardly hear it for about 10-15 minutes. Tonight, I tried popping my ears via the Valsalva maneuver to see if that might do anything for me, and I found that my left ear pops, while my right ear does not pop. The right ear feels somewhat 'full' when I try to pop it and it also feels as if some force is stopping it from being popped. I can briefly hear a small crackling like sound in my right ear when attempting to pop it. I have never had any issues popping either of my ears.

Could this mean there is some sort of blockage in my right ear and this may be the cause of my tinnitus? Or perhaps eustachian tube dysfunction? What could be causing this inability to pop my right ear? Any help is appreciated, thanks."

359,High ASO and rheumatic fever.,"Male, 31 year old, preexisting conditions: vitiligo(if it is relevant..). No medications.

Anyways, last July I did a regular bloodtest, everything came back normal besides my ASO. ASO was really high. They retested a second time and again my ASO came back high. I had a fever without a sore throat last June. The last time I had a sore throat was probably somewhere in December or January, but as far as I know it was a regular sore throat, not strep.

After this the doctor(an immunologist) told me to come to the hospital right away once I get a fever again. They want to test me for rheumatic fever, but they said they can only do this while I have a fever.

My questions are, is this the right way for diagnosing rheumatic fever? And if I have it, does my body only attack my heart during flare ups, or does this also happen while I am feeling normal?

Lately I also have random stabbing pain in random joints of my body(generally knees, heels and wrists). This only last for a few seconds and then dissapears. The joint feels normal after it. I also have a constant pain in the joint below my left thumb. In the past it was also my right thumb, but that pain went away. I would like to add that the pain is light and bearable. 

Should I wait till I get a fever or is there something else that me or the doctors should be doing? Thanks in advance."

361,Dosing for DayQuil and Mucinex,"I've come down with a cough that's lasted for a few days. Very mucous, my throat hurts, and I'm congested. I've bought generic DayQuil and generic Mucinex:

**DayQuil** (per 15 mL)

- Dextromethorphan HBr 10 mg
- Phenylephrine HCl 5 mg

**Mucinex** (per 20 mL)

- Dextromethorphan HBr 20 mg
- Guaifenesin 400 mg

I believe brand-name Mucinex only contains guaifenesin, which is why everyone says it's ok to take it with DayQuil. But this generic one also contains dextromethorphan, which I'm getting from the DayQuil anyway. Drugs.com lists the max does for dextromethorphan as 120 mg/24 hours.

So is it ok if I take both the Mucinex and the DayQuil every 6 hours? That keeps my dextromethorphan dose down to the 24-hour limit (and also follows the medicines' individual dosage directions). Or does it not matter if I just take 160 mg over 25 hours?

370,I'm afraid that I have some kind of bad illness!,"Hello everyone!

I'm a 18-year old male. I'm a hypochondriac and have OCD since around two years now. (Or rather that's when it started to get really bad.) I weigh 176 lbs (80kg)... Or well, that's what I usually weigh. I noticed today and the last couple days, that I've lost around 2kg in a week. I know that you should only lose 0.5kg a week IF YOU TRY to lose weight, but I did not even try to lose weight. I was eating like I normally was... Which is not the healthiest way to eat. (As in: I really like chocolate and ice cream and I ate a whole chips bag in like 5min)... I did start to eat more vegetables since two weeks, almost every day as in: Toast with cheese and then tomatoes and other vegetables, but that surely can't be the reason I'm losing weight, right? I mean, I'm still eating the unhealthy stuff, too!

The other thing I've been noticing since it became cold again is, that my hands and feet are always cold, no matter how warm it is in the room or not and no matter how much I move. This is a far bigger problem for me because this one is already there since three months and the doctors really didn't tell me anything about it. They say I gotta do more sports but that can't surely be the only reason my hands and feet are almost permanently cold, right?

Also to Sport: I do not do any sport anymore since three months and haven't done much before that. I signed up for a gym 4 months ago and started doing sport for around a month until I had to stop because I don't have anyone to drive me to the place which is quite far away from my home. I'm looking to get a bike to drive there but I also have other things on my mind atm. Else I've only done school sports before.

Anyhow, I hope you can answer my questions and -please- don't judge everything because of me being a hypochondriac!

Thanks."
371,Is it possible that my diaphragm collapsed?,"Male 20yo, 6’1”, 180 lbs, caucasian 

My spirometry result from March is overall good but PIF (peak inspiratory flow) was 3,5 liter, so 3x times less than normal value. I read that it’s parameter that represents diaphragm strength. 

How likely is that a measurement mistake because I didn’t put effort to inspiration? I wonder if I shouldn’t be able to function with that weak diaphragm? 

I am concerned because I was worried about some neuromuscular disease and decided to check all my previous test out of blue.  spirometry was done in March and my symptoms haven’t worsened besides weight loss. I am able to put 12 lbs weight on my stomach and breathe properly when lying flat, is it enough to prove that my diaphragm “is not weak”?

373,"Split-second Hearing/Head Shocks/Flashes - Hearing loss, Vission loss/Blurring","\- I have doctors' appointments over the next two days for ""separate"" issues (I'll explain more below) and don't know what to call this. I don't know what these ""Head shocks/flashes"" are, what the overarching cause is, or what will generally bring them on. Anyone have any ideas?

&#x200B;

\- What I **Feel:**

When these ""Flashes"" happen I feel like a shock or jolt in my brain, sound becomes muffled, vision blurs, and if I am doing something it will interrupt it (E.G. I noticed I pause in between steps or almost an inability to take the next step when it happens) **All of this happens and corrects within a split-second.**

&#x200B;

\- The three (3) most notable **things that happen** when I experience this are:

1. There will be this shock or jolt 

This shock which is almost electrical, I feel pulse quickly through my head and more specifically in my actual brain. 

&#x200B;

2. There is almost a loss of hearing or muffled sound in my ears 

The most intense feeling is within my ears. The best way I can describe it is **when you yawn and lose hearing or hear sounds muffled.** 

&#x200B;

3. Blurred vision or loss of vision 

Generally, it happens so fast that I'm not able to determine if I have fully lost vision or if it is just blurred. In any event, there is interference with my vision.

&#x200B;

\- What (I have been able to determine) **causes** these Flashes:

The only physical action that I have found to replicate it is looking as far to the side (Right or Left) using only my eyes and trying to focus. Sometimes when I do this I will get the same jolt or shock accompanied by the muffled sound. 

It seems as though some sounds along with some situations will be the cause. Sometimes both of them combined will is the cause and sometimes I can identify that it was one or the other, it really depends. The sounds are a wide range of different things, from music to traffic to white noise. If I had to put it to a certain type of sound I would say higher pitches seem to have more of an effect. Situations are also on a wide spectrum and are difficult to put my finger on. Lights may have something to do with it, or it could be a combination of things but it's harder to tell what is the cause the more things that are going on. Whereas if it is only a certain sound, or looking far to the side, it is easier to point out the cause.

When something causes a flash to happen I will generally (right away) try to replicate it. I have had more success replicating it when it is caused by looking to the side than if it is caused by something else (E.G. A sound or a situation). 

&#x200B;

\- How often it happens:

I will have weeks to months that it doesn't happen but when it does it generally will happen a couple times a day max. If I start to focus on it and try to replicate it, it will typically happen more.

I am in a Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Medical Trial/Study for the desmoid tumor in my right chest. I am taking Nirogacestat @ 200mg/day. We are almost sure that I am not on the placebo due to my side effects. I have been on trial for \~3 months, pain and swelling (around the tumor) has decreased substantially since the start. Tumor size has remained about the same, possibly increased in size.

I have an Appointment tomorrow/today (since it's 3am #sad) for the trial. The following day I have an appointment with my Neurologist to start a 24 hour EEG. I am planning to talk with all my doctors about the changes or increase in frequency about the Flashes. I have done some slight Google-ing into this but due to the increase of Flashes as well as the fact I have been having problems with cognition, I feel like more input would be helpful. 

I have had a Brain MRI and EEG that were both diagnosed as ""Normal"". However, something is definitely wrong. I have constant blood draws for the Study which again have come back normal. I also have had 3 MRI's of my chest just this year and was told (other than the tumor) there are no problems. Though these MRI's were specifically aimed at looking at the tumors, not my spine or brain. I have a constant tremble that gets worse when I focus on it, as well as cold sweats most nights. I have been dealing with the tumors since 2016 and have had 2 resections, External Radiation, Seromas in the area. Both recurrences occurred within 6 months of the surgeries. Due to chronic pain, last year, I was taking heavy opioids (Morphine x2/day, Percocet x1-2/day) for almost 8 months. The pain was still unmanageable to the point I was eating any other pain meds I could as well as smoking marijuana heavily and I still was in bed for most of the day due to the level of pain. Ever since coming off of the opioids I have felt like something is wrong and things just seem to keep getting worse. 

There is a huge backstory that I was planning on typing up but since it's after 3am (sorry for any typos) I am going to go to sleep. There is a lot of information that I feel like I am forgetting and hopefully will be brought up once I do post my full story. I will try to post it when I can and update the post as I get more information. If there is specific information that you would like clarification on or just any questions let me know. It has been a hard 4 years, I have had to drop out of college to deal with this and it is killing my family financially. I greatly appreciate any input that is given."
374,Bumps near the soles of both feet,"Caucasian female, 24yo, history of mental illness and I've been medicated for the past 18 years with Fluvoxamine (150mg daily) and omeprazol (20mg daily). I just noticed [these bumps](http://imgur.com/a/hox9aOv) near the soles of both feet.

The bumps are only noticeable when I am standing or placing most of my weight on my feet. They aren't painful or itchy or anything really, but why do I have these bumps?

I am worried because I've gained a looot of weight because of having severe depression and almost never leaving the house which means I spend most of the time sitting or lying down and I'm scared of it being something bad like a blood clot.

I should add that the bumps look a bit more noticeable irl than in the photo."
375,"32F Chest pains, but EKG fine","I went to urgent care for this about 12 hours ago, so I know it isn't an emergency. I just don't know what it is. 

Since about 2 PM yesterday, I have felt a stabbing pain and pressure - like something is violently pushing past my rib cage, trying to push my heart out of my back. So, my chest and the same general area on my back have been absolutely killing me. I haven't fallen or hit it in any way, and I was honestly laying in bed sleeping and/or watching TV all day yesterday when it started (it was my self care/relax day). Doctor at urgent care did an EKG, and the results were fine. I usually have low blood pressure (100/60 or so), but when they checked it last night it was 144/92 and my heart rate was in the 120s. He gave me a GI cocktail (maalox, lidocaine, phenobarbital w/ belladonna mix) thinking maybe it was heartburn or something, but it did nothing. I don't smoke, don't take birth control pills, so he didn't seem to think I was at risk for a blood clot.

I have CPTSD from an abusive spouse, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and have been dealing with a lot of stress the past couple months. Life altering stuff that's bringing back issues with the CPTSD that I thought I had dealt with. I have court dates and all sorts of crap to deal with for the next few months and the last couple days, I can't seem to get out of my head about it all. So, it's fair to say my stress levels are through the roof. For this reason, he decided the pain was probably from stress. He sent me home with Famotidine and Alprazolam. I took both last night, but it had no effect. I couldn't sleep on my left side, back, or stomach at all. My right side was the only way that my chest didn't scream in pain, but even that wasn't comfortable. So, I got little to no sleep. 

Woke up this morning with the pain still there so bad I want to cry, so I'm getting a little concerned again. I honestly agreed with the stress diagnosis, but the Xanax did nothing to ease it, so I don't know. I'm second guessing it now, and since I can't get into a doctor for a few more hours, I figured I would try here. 

Thank you for any insight you can offer."
376,Am I Doomed w/ a broken Coccyx?,"I fell 10 ft at the World Series game last Tuesday, and luckily I walked away with just a hairline fracture to my coccyx. I was in a state of shock and the alcohol in my system helped me walk 1 miles to an uber. I’ve never been in so much pain as when they were taking x rays and CT scan, then I had to drive 3 hours home without a doughnut. I am now Day 5, off pain meds completely and feeling better. I can walk, I can sit on the toilet, and I can sleep - albeit with some pain. I’ve been trying to search the internet on how others have healed - and all I seem to find are people who now can’t ever sit on a hard surface without some kind of pain - which is terrifying. I’m a 29 female, no health problems - and never any ass pain before. I know I have at least 2 months of discomfort ahead of me, but am I doomed for butt pain for life?"

Halved tramadol dose from 200mg sr to 100mg sr 2 months ago. I did not taper. Was on it for 7 years prior, LT goal to get off fully.

Unable to feel excited, interest, or good for months. Contantly bored. Recurrent suicidal ideation.

Could this be due to tramadol reduction? Could this improve with time?

Any information,  reading material would be appreciated. I have uni access to some journals. I would really like to know what impact the reduction could have had.

378,I (19F) can't stop peeing every 10-15 minutes,"19F, 5'2"", 132lbs (approx.), half East Asian/White.

I've been having problems with frequent urination for the past 2-3 years, with the frequency of urination increasing over time. For comparison, during my summer break (April-August), I only peed about every 30 minutes-1 hour, but in the past few weeks, I've had to pee every 10-15 minutes, sometimes less. I've been experiencing pain that gets more severe the longer I hold it in  (extreme pressure in my lower abdomen). In September, I was prescribed with Macrobid 100mg, and last week I got prescribed sulfatrim DS 800/160mg, both for possible UTI's, but neither made my symptoms any better. They've gotten worse in the one month between the two prescriptions. 

My family doesn't have a history of any kind of urinary diseases to my knowledge. I'm not on any medications, and I don't consume diuretics on a daily basis (I have 1 cup of coffee every few days, I drink alcohol weekly/bi-weekly). 

I have an appointment with my family doctor to be referred to a urologist tomorrow, but I was hoping for some ideas on what might be causing this. I really want to find a solution. I've missed a week's worth of classes recently because I couldn't sit through my lectures without being in pain. Any thoughts are appreciated. Thank you!"
379,"Two issues, possibly connected? 29 M Abdominal Issues and Lightheadedness","Hello. Two short paragraphs here, so thank you so much for your time. To preface, I have overall been very healthy most of my life I've had some bouts of depression and anxiety as well as frequent memory and fatigue issues. Also, lots of stress.

Starting with my abdominal issues, I became constipated almost 2 months ago. At first I had no BM's for about a week, then I began to have very small and frequently very thin stools. This was accompanied with minor lingering pain in what I assume is my colon (just inside my pelvic bone on both sides and alternating.) This caused me to see my doctor a month ago. He physically pressed on all my organs, and yes the only discomfort was in my upper colon area. I took some Miralax on his orders, which had absolutely no effect. I also did some blood work (doctor mainly wanted to see if I was anemic), which all came back good except for ""possible low thyroid,"" which I am supposed to see my doctor for again in 6 months as it wasn't alarmingly low. Doctor did not give me any answer nor did he suggest a followup for my current abdominal issues. I changed up my eating habits, eating more fruits and fiber-rich foods. As of now though, the small and thin stools + random days with no BM's continue and just seem to fluctuate. No discoloration of stools. No weight loss or gain. No fever. I drink tons of water.

Second part is the lightheadedness, which is the most concerning part for me. I've never had an issue with this before, and it started slightly after the abdominal issues. A month and a half ago I had some heart palpitations when I was just sitting and relaxing at home. I suddenly felt hot, mentally out-of-it, and my heart jumped up to about 130bpm from rest. It took about ten minutes to fully come back down, but the mental drain, anxiety, and dizziness lasted hours. I've never passed out in my life, but I definitely felt close then. I had never experienced this before, but it has now happened to me 3 times this year. One in April, one in May, then this last one in October. Aside from these unprovoked what I'm going to call panic attacks, I have been getting that lightheaded and sort of out-of-it feeling pretty often now (no palpitations). It seems to happen a lot during and after eating. Today, I was fine, then 4 bites into my meal I suddenly felt it. Was having a conversation with my mom across the table then sort of drifted off and became somewhat dizzy. Another example, last night I went to the gym for the first time in a while and got lightheaded after 4 different weightlifting exercises and had to go home. To add to this, I have been EXTREMELY fatigued lately. I have my moments when I'm great, wide awake, then just completely dead tired and not motivated to do anything but lay in bed for hours. Slept about 13 hours last night.

Any ideas? Advice? I wouldn't call myself a hypochondriac, but I know when something is wrong or different, and it definitely gives me anxiety just thinking about the symptoms, much less what may be the underlying cause."
380,What causes bright yellow very runny ‘stool’?,"Female/20/obese type 2 bmi 39 (but losing weight, my bmi was 50 in June)/diabetic T2 - metformin. Also on escitalopram 20mg. 

It’s a bit embarrassing, hence the throwaway, but I felt I needed to pass gas before but as I did,  it felt warm. I went to the bathroom and there was a yellow stain on my pyjamas, and as I wiped I saw bright yellow. It was very runny and don’t even know if I’d call it stool , but it came from the right place so I guess it was. 

Is this a cause for concern? I should mention I have been undereating since August. I’ve struggled with some disordered eating. My current TDEE is 2411, my BMR is 2009 and I’ve been eating anywhere from 0-800 (it varies.). Could this be causing something? Or does this just happen sometimes? I have been more constipated than usual lately if that is causing it? About 10 minutes after I needed the bathroom again and it was bright yellow liquid again in addition to some actual little pieces of stool. 

I feel fatigued quite a bit lately but don’t have much pain elsewhere in my stomach or anything. 

Last 2 weeks I’ve also had frequent urination and a shy bladder when urinating (takes a while but I usually always urinate - just a lot more frequently). My blood sugar hasn’t changed drastically so it could be a UTI,  but I don’t have burning or anything, just frequent urge to urinate. Idk if that’s related to this. I have a doctor’s appointment in 2 weeks anyway and I’d rather not go earlier if I don’t have to. 

Should mention, I fasted for 24 hours before this but like less than an hour before this happened, I caved and ate some cheesy potato bake. Not a huge portion, just small and a couple of potato slices, but I really regret it because of the carbs and calories. Idk what happened. But anyway if it is related, but it was less than an hour before his happened so I doubt it. I also ate less than 400 calories the day prior.

Oh I also had a can of Sprite No Sugar today, and 1 yesterday. IDK if it could be related."
381,What to expect from LIFT procedure?,"27M
190lbs
No medications at the moment

I have an anal fistula that exited through my leg (around the bottom of my left glute).  I had a previous surgery that put a seton in place so the tract could mature.  It’s been in about a month and a half now, and I’m set to go in and receive a LIFT procedure (Ligation of Fistula Tract).  I am very worried about this surgery, particularly any complications that may arise.  The surgeon informed me that there is a risk of incontinence, as well as erectile dysfunction.  Compounding that, I’m receiving the surgery from a military surgeon, on the first day of a brand new hospital opening.  So, I can see that a lot can go wrong in this scenario.  Maybe I’m being too harsh, but I’ve heard too many horror stories from my fellow service members, and if I was rendered incontinent and/or left with ED, I honestly don’t know if I could pull myself back from that.  It’s the same surgeon that put my seton in place, and other than the (expected) constant misery of leaking ... “fluid” nonstop, I don’t believe there were any complications.

I am very worried about the post-surgery period, as well.  I was informed I can’t work out for six weeks following the surgery, which sounds absolutely miserable, and is bound to leave me in a very depressive state.  However, I am more worried about defecating, and how much of a struggle it will be for me.  Considering that they only gave me ibuprofen and a stool softener following the surgery that put the seton in place, I’m scared that I will be in constant agony for the first two weeks or so.

If any docs could let me know what to expect, I would really appreciate it."
382,[22F] why would it take months for vitamin B12 supplements to show effects for my issues?,"My doctors suggested I try some B12 supplements because I've been having numbness in my feet while I walk. My B12 was on the lower side of normal on the blood test. They suggested this because everything else is good and the NCV was normal. I guess that this is the only potential cause even if the probability is very low.

They said it would take a month or two before I see the effects, (if I ever do, if this is the cause) but I am just curious to why it takes so long. Thanks :)

384,"Skin infection on Penis, Is it getting too serious","Hey team, Male age 20, Previously have had issues with some sort of UTI although I keep a high level of hygiene, Now I am experiencing a skin infection

Nearly a month back I had caused a cut on my penis from friction during intercourse, I am uncircumcised and this was slightly below the head of the penis. Things were fine for 2 weeks, quite a bit of irritation but I was watching twice a day and then keeping as dry as possible, Went to the doctor when it started to flare up. Doctor gave me Penicillin and an ointment as a swab came back with infection.

Even after carefully applying ointment and taking the antibiotics, this seemed to get worse, larger spots of raw skin and spreading to the head of my penis, I went to another doctor on Saturday.

She said the bacteria was rare in that it generally effects pregnant women. She also advise the previous ointment I was given contained steroids and which may be why this has got worse

She gave me amoxicillin and an anitfungal cream Now it's Monday where I'm from, Even with the new cream and antibiotics the infection is now pretty much all over the upper half of my penis when the foreskin is pulled back

Many parts red and very raw and other parts seem to have a more yellow/brown hue to the skin, There is a lot of fluid coming out of skin and when dabbing with a paper towel throughout the day leaves behind a yellow residue. The skin is now very swollen.

Is this becoming serious? I'm in no pain except for when pulling back the foreskin/touching the infected area, Amoxicillin doesn't seem to be kicking in and even washing with warm water and drying/using cream is not stopping the infection

I am in a position where I will be working long hour shifts til my day off on Friday, I have $0 in my account so I can't go to the doctor, I finish in 30 minutes, Where should I go from here. Am I being too paranoid or should I be going to ED after work?"
385,Father’s blood counts are extremely low post double organ transplant. Cancer?,"Father is 5’10”, 185lbs, 61M. On so many medications I can’t possibly list, but mainly he is on immunosuppressants - he had a liver and kidney transplant on 10 Aug of this year. Previously had Hep C for 20 years, which turned into cirrhosis of the liver, causing ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually lead to the need for dialysis and then a liver and kidney transplant. Smoked for 30+ years but has not for at least 15-20 years, previously smoked marijuana. 

He is having cold sx - not quite flu-like but runny nose, sore throat etc. He has a post-transplant follow up on Thursday because his blood work is looking bad. I’ll include the bad levels below.

My main thinking is that it’s possibly bone marrow or blood cancer. He had hepatocellular carcinoma pre-transplant and did multiple chemo treatments (the one where the inject chemo directly into the tumors, can’t remember the technical term) and the tumors were still present but they were inactive when transplant time came.

The levels are listed below but WBC, RBC, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin and platelets are low. Absolute neutrophil count is also low.

388,"35f Eye pain, watering, light sensitivity leading to headaches foe 3 weeks, not an infection. What next?","34f, 200lbs. Had a baby in July via c section, depression/anxiety well controlled with wellbutrin, also taking metformin for pcos, claritin, flonase, and singulair all for allergies. I work in a vet clinic but my boss doesn't think I have anything zoonotic. 

It started out as my right eye would not quit watering. To the point I cried all my makeup off within 2 hours of applying it. Then in a couple days it spread to the other eye. About a week after symptoms began, I started having mild crustiness around my eyes upon waking up and they sometimes felt ""goopy"" during the day. The crust was always clear and dried white, never yellow. I went to the free clinic (No insurance) lasr Monday and was given a z-pack and Polytrim and used the drops for 4 days with no improvement at all. Started having light sensitivity last Tuesday that led to headache if I didnt go into a dark room for relief. It would sort of build over the course of the day. Thursday (the fourth day on drops) I called the doctor back, she said it must be viral so switch to allergy eye drops and wait for it to run its course but call back Monday (tomorrow) if it hadn't improved. 
Today, my eye feels like there is something in it. Tried flushing it a few times, no change. Still watering in both eyes, light sensitive, etc. Right eye is worse but I have all symptoms in both eyes.  Also, my eyes are very red on the inner bottom eyelids, but my actual eyes are only mildly red. It doesn't look like pinkeye.

I went and got two over the past 4 days and while certain parts got better the overall thing has gotten worse dramatically.

But the pain at the base of my penis is acute whenever I walk or stand. I'm a little conceded as all pain and other symptoms have completely subsided apart from this one spot.

392,Is a variation in the temperature of bath water harmful for the human body?,"&#x200B;

I wanted to know about this in each of the following three cases (to be specific, I'm talking about showers in each of these cases):

1. Within the same bath, that is when I am not able to maintain a stable water temperature throughout the bath. For example, cold water before applying the shower ger, and warm water to wash it off.
2. Different baths within the same day, by which I mean cold water for the morning shower and warm water for the evening shower.
3. Alternating between cold showers and warm showers after every few weeks or months.

I wanted to know if there are any adverse effects, for the skin or for the metabolism or for any other process/function of the body. For reference, where I live, the average temperature is around 33^(o) Celcius with an annual average relative humidity of 75%.

 From what little knowledge of human body that I have, I guess I could figure out that the first case is definitely bad for the body as the blood flows from the internal organs of our body to the skin just to make sure that the surface temperature of our body is regulated during a bath. And so if the temperature of the water keeps changing, more blood will be required for the regulation of our body's temperature. Don't really know if that's harmful though.

The rules of the sub require me to post this additional information, which I don't think is really relevant in this case:  \[21M 57kgs 175 cm\]

393,20M I have walking unbalance (no idea why) and it's getting worse with time. Now I feel restless and feel almost constant nausea and headaches.,"(I'm Italian born and raised in Italy if it helps... Sorry if I'm not using a good English)

Started noticing 5/6 months ago that walking was becoming an issue. I mean I really didn't noticed but some co-workers started to make fun of it and that when I noticed because when I walked I really had no idea I was doing it bad. 
Maybe I should have gone to the doctor before but I was on a summer job as an animator in a tourist village in another nation (Greece) so I couldn't do much. 

I went home in the end of August and now I'm doing my first year of university at the end of September (a bit of a stressing course even tho I like it).  


I have noticed that walking became more difficult. Since two weeks I started realising I wasn't walking properly, while I was taking the steps I could feel that my walk wasn't a normal walk and in the last few days I started feeling a little pain while walking (might just be stress I don't know). If it wasn't looking very weird especially for no real reason I swear I would use a stick to help me walking.

I started feeling tired, I'm not sure how but when I wake up I feel like I rested only half. Like if I rested mentally but not physically or something similar even though I sleep enough time. After I stay up some hours (usually it ranges between 5 to 7 pm) I start to feel like I haven't rested for days and it literally hurts to keep my eyes open. When I reach that level of tireness it already happened a lot of times that if I am standing up sometimes I just loose completely my balance and my legs just won't keep me up. This happens even more when I am near a wall or someone is doing anything remotely similar to touching me (like I never fell on the ground. Either the wall or other person catch me first or my legs restart to work after some seconds, just enough to let me almost fall down but don't)

After some time I started having nausea like if I was on a boat trip (really weird think for me since I never felt sick once while on boats or even rollercoasters) every time I was on a car driving, doing the stairs or sometimes even for reasons I didn't understood.


I tried to do some online research (I know I know, searching on Google what I have is the worst thing I could do...) and I may look like ear infection? 
Since I was a kid I always had hearing problems because I have a micro ear implant inside, so that's not really a good signal. But I remember clearly that the swimming pool in the village was very very dirty (I think they never out chlorine in the water) and after a while I had to stay inside more often that usual in the swimming pool my ears literally started hurting a lot, and they stopped only after a few days I was away from the water. The pain stopped after I came back home so I didn't really thinked about it much...

I'm on the line to see a doctor now but at least here it takes a lot of time to talk with them so I will probably have one hour and something to read what you think. I will update with what my doctor will say of course.
 
Thanks in advance"
394,String From Gauze Stuck In Wisdom Teeth Stitches,"17M.  Not sure if this is the right place, but I feel as tho I should ask.  So yesterday I got my wisdom teeth taken out and since the bottom ones were really in there, when they cut it out I needed stitches.  The Rest of it wasnt important, but at one point i ran out of gauze while my mouth was still bleeding.  So like I thought i should i cut a piece of gaws in 2 so i could place it in the back of my mouth.  It wasn't till today when i was checking the mirror to see how my wound was doing, when I saw the white string from my gauze entangled in my stitches.  I can Imagine that i can remove it myself, but I would rather not go digging in my mouth and accidentally take out my stitches along with some inner mouth skin.  I see my dentist next saturday for a checkup.  Should I wait till then or just try and rinse it out with water."

399,Been sick with ongoing autoimmune flare ups and constant cold for 2 months after getting influenza A/B and pneumonia in September.,"30 Female
Caucasian 
108lbs 5’3”

History:

Type 1 diabetes 
Pulmonary hypertension 
Hypothyroidism 
Autoimmune Enteropathy 
Lymphocytic colitis and gastritis 
Narcolepsy with Cataplexy 
Lichen Planus (oral) 

Medications:

Xyrem for Narcolepsy 
Sunosi for Narcolepsy 
Humalog using Diabetic Pump
Levothyroxine for Hypothyroidism
Prednisone (currently on a 2 week course for pneumonia issue / pulmonary sounds) 

Previously on Cellcept for GI issues /autoimmune flares which I stopped over a year ago. 


So a little back story: 

So I work with kids and hot influenza A and B and bilateral pneumonia in early September and was hospitalized and placed on augmentin ans tamiflu and prednisone. 

Two weeks later I have severe popping and grinding upon inhale and exhale with severe pain in my right lung when breathing. ER re-diagnosis bilateral pneumonia (even though I know CT scans and Xrays can show pneumonia for months even after it’s treated and cleared) went back on augmentin. Things got better and cleared up for about a week. 

Popping and grinding and pain comes back, so I see a pulmonologist. My pulmonary function test came back low end of normal but he said it’s still very abnormal for me and in comparison to last years pulmonary function test. I’m back on prednisone and seem to be ok but my immune system is taking a major dive. And I’m unsure what’s going on...

So here’s what I’ve noticed in addition to still having ongoing cold symptoms (nose running/stuffed with dark green mucus, cough with green phlegm, severe fatigue despite well controlled narcolepsy previously, nausea, sore throat) 


My lichen planus on my tongue is flaring up daily but then better by night??? In the morning the white lacy patch under my tongue is bloody and peeling off my tongue but by evening it’s barely hurting or visible...
My nails I’ve noticed are getting like horizontal bumps....like speed bumps and they are shiny. 

I’ve been having severe diarrhea and I’m having hard lumps develop on my legs - I’ve always had one dermatofibroma but three more just showed up within the last couple weeks (or at least they look the same as my one dermatofibroma) 


I have a lot of doctors and specialists because I’ve had a long complicated medical history.... but I’m not sure if I’m just noticing a bunch of shit randomly and overthinking it or if this has to do with me being sick still..."
400,Strange flickers in vision upon waking up,"I've been experiencing a strange flicker in the center of my vision upon waking up. They last about 5- 10 minutes and I still see them if I close my eyes. Both times I experienced this I had taken Cialis the night before. I was paranoid and felt like my vision was blurry so I went to an ophthalmologist and they did some test on me. They concluded that my optic nerve looked fine and that my vision was perfect. I'm primarily paranoid about getting NAION from Cialis and was wondering how likely this was. I know I should stop taking it but it has significantly improved my well being so it's difficult.

401,So torn! RAI or Total Thyroidectomy?,"Please give me some input. I have Graves disease. I am in normal range right now with all my labs. I have a slight enlargement of the thyroid. Right now, my endocrinologist and I have decided to continue on the 2.5mg/daily methimazole, as my numbers are normal. I still have the emotional crud that accompanies this disease, but then again, it may be time to change up some of my Bipolar meds. I am not sure if the thyroid is causing the deep depression and anxiety, or just my regular crazy. I digress.  I am scared that the RAI will cause thyroid or other cancers down the road, or I would have done the RAI by now. The surgery seems safe, but I am terrified of being put under. I am 41, female. Is RAI safe, or can it cause serious problems down the road? I am a very anxious person, and am convinced I will develop anaplastic thyroid cancer in the future if I opt for RAI.

Symptoms: 
Weird heart feeling , feels like my heart is going to stop. Happens random times during the day, sometimes consecutively. Like its squeezing, or losing energy, I dont know.

Its gets hard to breath, feels like a chore.

When the weird heart feeling starts, I feel like my lungs get full of water or something that I will have to cough out.

I dont know why is this happening, I am only a 19 year old guy.

I dont know if I should get a  ECG or a doctor appointment, I fear it might be a false alarm, but it keeps getting more noticeable, its very noticeable.

Sometimes I feel like thats it, like Ill die in the next minute. Like my heart is squeezing or something. It feels really scary. Please someone tell me what to do."
403,"Please can someone help, I’ve asked a few times but yet to get a straight answer. Can an obese person who is restricting food and having fasting days do it for longer without serious health ramifications than average and underweight people, due to the fat deposits their body can utilise?","Female/in my 20/122kg/179cm/diabetic type 2/hypertension/depression/anxiety/medicated for it all except I came off Metformin a few weeks ago 

So, if an obese person has been eating roughly 600- 800 calories a day since August, and for the last month or so is eating 0-600 calories a day (it varies and includes occasional fasting days), are they less likely to have health issues as the body can survive off fat deposits? And if they continue to do this for a while, again, are they less likely to develop serious issues due to the fat the body can use? And how long can it be sustained if say the average is 450 calories a day? 

I read a true story about an obese person surviving for a year without eating a single thing - so it makes me think obese people can do it a lot more safely than others. And I keep reading different things online, but I read a few things that say when we don’t eat enough our body uses the fat to survive, and as obese people have a lot of fat, doesn’t this logically mean the body will break down a lot less slower than people doing the same things without that much fat?

I don’t mean in terms of vitamin deficiencies etc., but like organ break down etc. and how long does it usually take for health issues to occur due to this undereating? 

I know it’s not healthy and is disordered eating, but I really just need to know this. I know I should not be eating by this but yeah. When I do eat it is healthy. Please if anyone can answer the question it’d be appreciated."

Three years ago I had a massive blood loss during a surgery and I received blood transfusions worth of 10 blood bags. Some years (10 years) before this event I had unprotected sex. In the last year I got tested for HIV and it came negative. My question if I was HIV infected could I have lost the HIV antibodies during the hemorrhage or could they have been diluted by the transfusion rendering the hiv antibodies test inaccurate ?"
409,Bulging Disc Pain for over one year?,"45, female, no prior history of back (or any chronic) pain, California 

I was rear ended mid October last year. I was sore enough the next day that I went to urgent care. I ended up lawyering up because the other guy’s insurance agency was dragging their feet providing rental and car seat reimbursement.

Lawyer sent me to a doctor who had MRI done in November. The whole entire appointment was shoddy, lasting about ten minutes, and the nurse practitioner seemed to get all the info she needed with 3-4 movements, minimal questions, and a quick jogging motion. I was never told the MRI results but given 12 sessions of physical therapy.

Physical therapy took 4 months to get through instead of the recommended 6 weeks because I could only go once a week and it was winter so colds/flu.

Felt a bit better after physical therapy but it came back in force a few weeks after it ended. I have always had decent range of movement. Some restrictions from muscle tightness or pain, and mild pain in neck, mid and lower back almost all the time, like sore muscles. I had one particular area between my shoulder blades, at that spot you can almost reach to scratch, that felt different than the other pain. Deeper and spontaneous. I could reach to the fridge top half a dozen times and it would only spike once. But that spike would HURT and then it would be gone. The other pain is Sciatic, mostly down my left leg. It gets better with walking and non twisty activity but walking makes my mid back hurt more.

I complained to my lawyer that I wanted a third MRI in the mid back area and they set one up. Again, no face to face with doctor. I was told over the phone that I have a bulging disc and Dr thinks it’s pressing against a nerve. He recommended pain management.

The referral for pain management went through a chiropractor (reason below). I strongly dislike the chiropractor or any other hands on treatments such as massages and facials so I had refused the chiropractor before. Ironically, it was the chiro who first gave me an explanation of the injury and that it is two bulging discs, not just one (C5 and C6). Also ironically, he tells me that I am out of alignment precisely where my mid back pain radiates from. I agree to a 3/week treatment for 3 months. I made it through 2 months and my anxiety has taken over and I don’t want to go back. I had restricted them to only using the adjuster in stead of manual manipulation.

I’ve now been through my first round of pain management with lidocaine shots in my mid and lower back. I felt great, almost like I could get away with a Zumba routine or a jog (running **really** spikes mid back pain). It lasted almost 2 weeks and upon my follow up, it felt like the doctors were scratching their heads. “The results of my MRI are good” and they “don’t know why I’m having pain”. They are considering sending me for another MRI and I am having another round of lidocaine this month. I want nothing stronger because we are still (casually) trying to conceive.

My pain has risen from a 1-3 at rest (doing nothing; relaxing or sitting) to a 2-4 at rest. The sciatic I think is typical. Difficulty bending, adjusting sleeping position hurts, the first few steps after rising are a bear and it can take a few steps before I can stand upright. The mid back pain is more bothersome. It climbs steadily to a 6-8 whenever I do anything that has my arms out in front of me. Brushing my daughter’s hair, cooking, dishes, laundry. And it burns to a debilitating point when I hold even a newborn baby for too long (20 minutes, I’m a childcare worker).

I don’t have the money to go see the doctor I want. I belong to a healthcare ministry, not an hmo. The ministry will reimburse me for my expenses but I must pay as a cash paying client first. They have even approved stem cell shots, if I turn out to be a candidate, but again I have to pay first. My long term plan is to go to the Dr of my choice who is a specialist that does in-house scans (and treatment) but I’m very worried my settlement will fall short. 

For the doctors, I have 2 questions and also one huge thank you for reading through this. 

1. Is there a protocol I can use or refer to that will help me get seen by my preferred Dr BEFORE the settlement? I am filling out my closing statements so it is near. The doctor does not work via lien and is unfamiliar how a healthcare ministry works. Note that ministry pays 90% with my responsibility being the last 10%. It does take up to 60 days. I have the 10% already. I have already spoken with my ministry, and opened a case, to make sure it will be covered. 

2. Everything I’ve read or been told states that a C5 C6 nerve injury should affect the upper body. The pain management Dr has suggested it is compressing the inside of my spine instead. The only time I have tingling is when the pain management nurse raises my leg, bringing my ankle to above my waist, in a sitting position. Most of my pain is when I lean slightly forward. I’d like to know if sciatic and mid back pain can be caused by my disc bulges. I can’t imagine a muscular injury taking this long to heal. 

Thank you. Not for taking the time to observe not only my question but all the others which take up your time which is truly precious."
410,Toddler night sweats,"Hi, I posted this a week ago, but had no responses, so I'm reposting this one time in the hopes someone may have info. I also took her to see our doctor during the past week too, but they have no idea what is causing it either. 

2.5yr old female, mixed race Polynesian/Caucasian. Weight 14.5kg, height 98cm. No meds, drugs, no known allergies. 

Hi, this one is about my daughter... 8/10 nights she sweats, profusely from her scalp. Only her scalp. She still only has quite short hair, and she sweats so much that it's like her head has been dunked in water. 

Temperature doesn't make a difference. Even if it's cool, and she is dressed lightly, still she sweats. 

She doesn't sweat while she is awake or during her day nap. It happens during night sleep only. I have cotton sheets and a bamboo type pillow for her. 

Is this normal? Should I be concerned?"
411,Heart Rate Fluctuations,"After I experienced a heart palpitation early tonight (it felt as though my heart skipped a beat), I put on a heart rate monitor, and got a heartbeat that was all over the place. In a 30-second period, my heartbeats per minuted skipped from a 68 bpm to a 80 bpm and everywhere in between without consistently rising or decreasing (there were jumps were 71 bpm to 77 bpm back to 74 bpm, etc.). A few weeks ago, I put on a coworker's Apple Watch and was greeted with the same results: a heartbeat that was all over the place. Do I need to get this checked out? Please let me know; thank you, in advance!

For reference, I am on thyroid medication (Levothyroxine 112.5 mcg). I am a 24-year old male, and I did a stress test and echo last year to make sure everything was fine, both of which came back normal, and I have done a few EKGs during the last year. Again, all of those have come back normal."
412,Excessive gas and farting a lot (19m),"So this started Junior year and I noticed one day after dinner the next day I had excessive gas throughout the entire school day, I thought it was a one time thing and that I just had a bad reaction to the food.

It has been going on since that point up to now (2 years) I went to a doctor once where they prescribed me some sort of stuff I put in my water to help pass stool but it didn’t help. The doctor said they also noticed that I had a backup of stool built up in my stomach and to this day I still have a problem with it. 

What can I do to help this case? I don’t want to go forever having this issue."

Semi-Recent iron transfusions (2 months ago)

I loved how I started feeling after the transfusions. Finally kicked the pica of flavored crushed iice. But I can feel it fading.

Today, i took a selfie with my dog and noticed a distinct difference in the color of my face and neck. I'll try add the pic. I also took a pic of the inside of my eyelids because I heard a dr can tell something g from that? I dont vwear face makeup do that doesn't come into play. 

I feel tired today. And more emotional than necessary, not related to my period although my cycle makes a big difference in fatigue and emotion.
I'm also having a hard time finding the right words for what I want to say. I know the word and the feeling it image associated with the word, I just cant..find it.

Is this just...how I am or does this indicate I need another transfusion. Tbh, I hope so because I feel so much better on them. But ii don't want that to be my normal."
414,Lips keep swelling with Throat infection- doctors not giving me answers,"Hello! I am a 24 year old female, 5’2, and 143lbs. Occasionally drink and socially smoke. 

Since May, I have been getting a throat infection that is accompanied with my lips and tongue swelling (mostly just bottom lip, but at times it’s my top one) First time it happened, the doctor dismissed that the two are related, and said i probably had allergies and an infection. 

I had an allergy test, which came out positive to a few plants that I am not exposed to. A month later, my throat infection came back with my lips swelling (simultaneously). A different doctor couldn’t figure out why that happened, gave me antibiotics and dismissed me. The infection came back again, and so did the lips swelling. This in total so far happened five times since May, I personally do not believe my lips and throat are unrelated. When my uvula turns red, my lips go numb and swell at the same time. The swelling lasts around 15 hours. My infection will not go away since May. 

Anyone has any suggestions as to what could be happening to me? 

Also in May, I moved to a new place that has mold in the shower. Could this be relevant? idk."

So this morning I had my second sex headache / thunderclap headache I’ve ever had. 

The first was maybe years ago self masturbating. 
Today was regular intercourse. 

Today’s episode had build up of tension and felt like someone hit me on the head with a hammer right at orgasm. It peaked in the first 5 minutes and I remember yelling it was so painful. 

This was 3am. It’s now 8pm and I still have a dull tension headache. 

Google searching says this happens to people (makes more commonly) occasionally. Could have underlying issues and you could choose to get your head checked out. 

Any other personal knowledge or affirmation would help. This was such a strange occurrence. I hope it doesn’t happen again! 
Should I get my head checked? Have you had this happen? What are your thoughts? Any info is appreciated!"

Caucasian 

Medical issues: have been diagnosed with a possible brain tumour (might also just be a collection of vessels as per neurosurgeon) but have been frequently monitored and has not grown through the years. Anxiety, periods of depression, migraines. 

Medications: Currently on Wellbutrin 150mg, reactine 10mg, Apri 28 and prestique 50mg. Also have a medical marijuana prescription. 

Throughout this, I was prescribed various medications for anxiety but was taken off the medication due to bad side effects.

I don’t drink often. Maybe once every couple months. I do smoke marijuana regularly. Mostly just smoke a bowl before bed. 

Complaint: I haven’t had a period in 1.5 years. The last period I can remember was in approx May-June of 2018. I was going through a situation at work where I was being bullied and that’s when my period had stopped. My family doctor said that during stressful times, your period may stop. I was prescribed medications for anxiety/depression due to the bullying. There was many medications (sorry I can’t remember all of them) that was prescribed through trial and error. I was prescribed pristiq at the beginning of 2019. I gained 50lbs in a month which my doctor says is a side effect of the medication. I was to my family dr almost every month over the pass 1.5 years. Every time I see him, I tell him I haven’t had my period and he doesn’t seem to care. I also changed jobs mid 2019 and have not had any stress since then. He did bloodwork at the beginning of 2019 and said everything came back normal. I have had multiple pregnancy tests and all come back negative. I recently went to a woman’s clinic to have a Pap smear done and I’m waiting for the results. I have went to my pharmacy to see if maybe one of the medications was interfering with my period. They are all shocked that nothing has been done and have faxed my dr regarding this situation and nothing has been done on his end.

My medications are 40 mg lisinopril twice daily, prednisone 60 mg once daily, ranitidine twice daily, and fish oil 1000mg daily. 

My question is, WHY does prednisone cause upset stomach/ulcers? I have looked online but I can’t find a direct answer to the question. My understanding is that it affects acid production in the stomach, hence the ranitidine. 

As a follow up, can prednisone still cause upset stomach even if I use acid reducers and antacids as necessary? And if so why?"

The hospital put my mom in a machine and told her it was a hernia. She went to see a surgeon a few months later. The surgeon had her lay down, touched her stomach, etc and he concluded that it was diastasis. I googled it and it says that diastasis is only from pregnancy though? To make matters worse, he said that she’ll have to live like this for the rest of her life. She’s miserable and a shell of her former self. She can’t work anymore because of the weight of it.

422,What kind of training do docs get for dealing with multisick people?,"I have a lot of illnesses and it feels like no doctor knows hows how to deal with it. I’m losing sleep over my situation, I’m having a hard time seeing my life ever being good. Different doctors and healthcare professionals spit out ignorant comments on every appointment. It feels like they don’t have any sense of empathy and just want me out of their offices asap even though there would be time left on my appointment. 

All my doctors have access to all my medical records and still they have a hard time having a holistic approach to my treatment. I try not to sound ignorant, not every doctor can be specialized in everything, but some things they lack knowledge of are things we’ve been through in high school health class.

423,Serious hunger pains even after eating.,"Hi, I'm a 24 year old male and ever since yesterday I've been experiencing serious stomach pains which feel like extreme hunger. I first started feeling them around 2 hours after my dinner. I thought nothing of it and started making myself two sandwiches. The pain persisted. I then found an article on hunger pains and how to treat them and to not contact a doctor until you've at least eaten regularly a few times.

I've slept the previous night for around 10 hours, therefore I'm fairly certain it's not sleep deprivation. Just this morning I ate six thick sandwiches and I have drunk around 6 glasses of water yet this pain continues to mess with me.

I've been unable to sleep properly this night due to the pains and woke up every 15 mins or so. Due to waiting my current      practitioner is no longer taking on new appointments.

Could someone tell me what to do to alleviate the pains before I can schedule an actual appointment with my doctor?"
424,Birthmark or skin condition?,"I'm 16F and I have what I assume to be a birthmark that stretches from beneath my breasts, in between them, and up to my neck. It's incredibly mottled around my neck and shoulders, but still noticeable enough to where I've had people ask about it. My natural skin tone in those areas is about #FFD7A3, but the discoloration is about #F1C27D (afraid to show pictures of it because I'm a minor). The skin on the discoloration is also more dry than the rest of my skin.

The thing that really concerns me, though, is that I don't remember having this as a child. I asked my mom about it, and she doesn't remember it either.

I don't  know if this will get any sort of response other than ""go see a dermatologist"" but I'm posting it anyways."

428,I did a foolish thing with my medication and now need advice,"Female, 26 years, 67kg, 5ft 5. 

The doctor gave me flagyl and amoxyl for a stubborn gynae infection on Friday. The doc explained that amoxyl would target the bacteria and flagyl will deal with anything else. 

Through my own stupidity, I have seriously messed up. I took iron supplements because coming off a heavy menses and I'm severely anaemic. Knew that I can't take iron with antibiotics so I delayed the start of amoxyl. But I thought flagyl was just for yeast overgrowths so I took my first dose on Friday. It gave me diarrhoea which made me think that maybe it didn't get on with the supplement. So believing it would be ok to just stop taking it and start in a week with the amoxyl, I skipped two days of flagyl. I only took one pill (supposed to take 3 a day).

Well today my right hip aches terribly. I know from experience that it's the lymph node inflamed from the infection. It wasn't inflamed last night so this means that the infection is ramping up. I'm in so much pain, So I've now started  my antibiotics and flagyl courses today. I intend to stay on schedule. I'm just concerned on whether the meds will do anything. I'm in a lot of pain right now and it's been three hours since the first dosages  

*Tldr: Took a flagyl tablet and then skipped two days. Also mixed it with an iron supplement. My right hip lymph node tells me the infection is doing bad things. Very painful. Am I correct to just resume my dosages and hope for the best?*"
429,Tumor in Bladder," 

Hi, Husband is:

\- 38 years old

\- Caucasian

\- symptoms started one year ago: blood in urine. dark colored urine.vague pain and discomfort in lower abdomen

He underwent several blood test and an abdominal ultrasound. everything came back clear. Urine analysis came back negative for UTI. He continued to experience symptoms and he got sent for a cystoscopy. The Urologist saw a small tumor, gave him a couple of pamphlets and sent him on his way. we're waiting for a surgery appointment.

I feel a little lost. Here are my questions:

\- The tumor was described as small. does that suggest a slow-growing, low-grade tumor if one-year post onset of symptoms the tumor is still small?

\- If the appearance of the tumor is small, does that indicate a greater likelihood that it did not invade the muscle layer or lymph nodes?

\- 1% of those diagnosed with bladder cancer are under 40. does that indicate a greater likelihood that it is a non-cancerous tumor?

\- He had a granuloma in the testicles 3 years ago (shortly after a  vasectomy). I read that granulomas very rarely present in the bladder (less than a dozen documented cases). He was suspected of having sarcoidosis based on increase ACE in blood test and uveitis but does not have an official diagnosis. No lung involvement. could it be a granuloma?

\- Could the tumor be a metastasis of another cancer in another part of the body, such as the pancreas? are they going to test for other cancers??"

Sex: Male
Height: 5’11”
Weight: 165 
Smoking status: I smoke marijuana 

Background: So about 2 years ago I was hanging with this girl from tinder. We smoked and hung out, it was enjoyable and I didn’t expect anything to happen with her cuz she seemed like she wanted to take things slow. But one thing led to another and she ended up giving me a blowjob. When I came I felt a sharp pain. I didn’t think anything of it, I thought it’d go away. But a slight pressure in my left testicle persisted that made it uncomfortable and hard to get aroused. It ended up being epididymitis, inflammation of the epididymis. After a couple of rounds of antibiotics (doxycycline & ? I forgot; doxy got rid of it) and going to a specialist it went away. All of this took about 6 months. 

For the last ~18 months I’ve been dealing with a different issue. I’m not sure if it’s complications of the epididymitis or what. What happens is that when I try to “stimulate” myself, I get the urge to urinate. I can still ejaculate but I have to do it very fast and pee between rounds of getting erect. It’s very annoying and it’s kept me from having sex these last two years. It’s debilitating and I’m not sure what it is; google hasn’t helped me. Is this a prostate issue? 

P.S. whenever I smoke (since the epididymal incident) my left testicle drops and I cannot get aroused; it brings discomfort and I don’t even attempt to masturbate when I’m high. 

Please help with my issue!"

It stopped my period completely, I haven’t had one since the indentation. Again, I was told that was normal. 
I have not had a single pregnancy symptom. My breasts are not sore at all, no weight gain, no nausea, nothing. However, last night I noticed a white liquid leaking out of my breasts. I freaked out and took two desperate pregnancy tests, both coming back negative. What could be going on? I’m so confused. Should I take a blood pregnancy test or is this a hormone imbalance?

436,Medical Mystery,"I am going to try to make this as short as possible but there is a whole lot. I have been seeing tons and tons of doctors for these things that have been happening but I have found no answers.

For background info, I am female, almost 15 years old and I have always been a little underweight but recently I have been gaining a lot of weight (I am at 112 now and still gaining more). I think the weight gain is from my Atarax but I am not sure. 

This started in 2018 and it has never stopped and things kept adding on to it. I have lots of symptoms, and I am not sure if they are all related but I am going to post them all anyways just in case.

First symptoms: I have always suffered from anxiety but in the past year and a half things got way worse and I had very severe anxiety and depression. I have been seeing a therapist pretty consistently for over a year. My depression has become very tolerable within the past month but my anxiety has always stuck. I take Hydroxyzine (Atarax) at 25MG 4 times a day

Second symptoms: Knee pains started around November of 2018 and since then they have developed into joint pain in every joint, but my knees always stayed the worst. I also have psoriasis on my elbows, knees, and ankles. We sort of ruled out juvenile arthritis but not really. I take Naproxen 500MG twice a day and recently started Sulfasalazine 500MG twice a day for joint pain. For my psoriasis I recently have been using Triamcinolone Acetonide .025% at night.

Third Symptoms (biggest): At the beginning of 2019, I started to experience shortness of breath after minimal exercise and it took hours for me to be able to catch my breath. I still have chest pains and shortness of breath all the time. I was recently diagnosed with mild exercise induced asthma but it is very small and I have not yet tried an inhaler. Then in March 2019, I out of no where started to hyperventilate after a practice (I did winter guard/ color guard). The hyperventilation included the pins and needles, but it went away after a couple minutes. I assumed it was an anxiety attack and thought nothing of it. Then later that day after my competition performance, after I left the floor I dropped to the ground and had the same hyperventilation and pins and needles except this time it was worse. From then on I had them about 4-5 times a week, and each time got worse. I am not in a sport anymore, so I have them maybe after 2-3 weeks and they are always after I exercise in any way at all and once was from crying. These are now my consistent symptoms that get worse every time;

\-hyperventilation

\-pins and needles on tongue, mouth, nose, arms, hands, legs, and feet

\-unbearable severe pain in my arms and legs

\-crying from pains

\-unable to move

\-extreme dizziness

\-confusion and I ""black out"" in a way where I don't remember what was happening around me or who was there but I stay conscious

\-tenseness and cramping of hands (search images of ""hands with hypocalcemia"" for image)

\-muscle weakness

\-shakiness

\-blotchy skin

\-weird temperatures and feelings around my body

These ""attacks"" last about 25 minutes but they totally wipe me out and leave me tired and sore for the next few days. I have been told this is Hypocalcemia and also told it is Alkolotic Tetany (I think these go hand in hand) but, I haven't taken steps to get official diagnosed, I just got a phone call from my primary doctor about a month ago after he saw a video of me in this state.

Other things maybe worth mentioning are;

\-Scoliosis

\-Constant fatigue

\-Constant headaches

\-Constant back aches

\-Constant stomach pains that occasionally get unbearable

\-Constipation

\-Often cold

\-Frequently gets sick

\-For more than a year I have had symptoms of a UTI

I think this is about it, please comment if you need more information about a specific topic or have guesses, anything would help, this thing makes me miss school and took me out of the sport I love"
437,Cramps behind around underside of right knee -- concerned about blood clots,"Hello,

38M, 6'4"", 207 lbs.

**Medications:**

Mometasone furoate powder 220mcg 1x morning, 1x bed

Famotidine 1x20mg morning, 1x20mg before bed

Esomeprazole 1x20mg before dinner

Cetirizine as needed, standard 24hr dose

Meloxicam 7.5mg as needed with food, generally around dinner time

**Preexisting health conditions:**

Psoriatic arthritis

Asthma

GERD w/ Hiatal Hernia

&#x200B;

The past few days, I've been seemingly randomly getting cramps in my right leg. On the pain scale, 0 being no pain, the pain has ranged from a 2 to a 4. Thursday and Friday evening, they were in the underside of my knee.

On Thursday, I woke up at roughly 2 am with pain at about a 4. The pain was not constant, and only felt when I moved my leg in certain positions. I was able to reposition it to where I didn't feel pain, and fall back asleep. When I woke up around 9:00 AM, the pain was still present. As the day moved on, it went away.

Friday, the pain was less severe, I'd say maybe a 3, but I felt it getting in to bed instead of it waking me. Same phenomenon as before... found comfortable position, fell asleep. Didn't wake up in middle of night w/ pain, woke up at roughly 9 AM, pain disappeared.

Saturday I took a meloxicam, NO pain, whatsoever.

Tonight the pain is back, but it's slightly higher up my leg, near my hamstring. It's about a 2. I had zero problems until I began doing some cleaning and vacuuming, after which I sat down. 20 minutes after sitting down, I felt a cramp in my leg, which has persisted up until writing this and then reduced to about a 1. Changing positions helps, to the point where I don't feel it any more. It started at roughly 8:30 PM EST, it's now 9:35 PM EST.

I did take a meloxicam tonight.

Throughout these cramps, I have not had any swelling, warmth, or discoloration.

Given the timing (night) I'm led to believe it may one of the many wonderful gifts of my psoriatic arthritis, but after reading about blood clots and how tricky they are, I've been waffling between getting it checked out and not.

Should I get this checked out?"
438,Abnormal Pap Smear risk? [22][F],"Hi, I'm a 22 year old female. 135 pounds, 5'2, Caucasian, 150 mg Wellbutrin HCL XL 1x day for depression and anxiety, drink some, smoke cigarettes socially, been sober from other drugs for over 3 years. 

I got my first pap smear in March. I got a call  saying it was abnormal but not to worry about it an to come back next year. I didn't know what that meant and said ok. I went back for something else at the end of July, and the nurse asked if I came back for the tests I needed after my Pap. I told her I wasn't told to get any tests, so she went to find a doctor. The doctor told me just to come back next year instead of in 3 years to keep an eye on it, and also not to worry about it, that it's pretty common. I still didn't really understand. Does that mean I'm 100% positive for HPV? Would that be a separate test? They didn't instruct me to do anything about it, so I've had unprotected sex a few times for short periods of time and also received oral sex many times since then. I've only had one partner who I am still with. Does this mean he (22M) has HPV? 

I guess what I'm asking is how likely is it that I have HPV vs something else causing the mutation in cells. Online it said it could be caused by many things, and my doctor didn't tell me what type of cells she found. Can I continue to have oral sex, or is he at risk? Also, is it worth going back for another Pap early just to see if they have gone away yet? Also considering just calling my doctor but I'd rather not. Thanks for any help!"

non smoker 
USA
Post menopausal 
preliminary MRI leiomyosarcoma diagnosis, hysterectomy scheduled for one week out.

Hello, met with an oncologist on Friday. Leiomyosarcoma diagnosis is suspected due to a peduncled subserosal uterine fibroid growing quickly AFTER menopause. MRI and ultrasound showed blood flow as well as a small amount of free fluid. Oncologist wanted to do the hysterectomy on Monday (tomorrow) but arrangements could not be made in that time so it is scheduled for a week out. 

I know that a definitive diagnosis will not come without biopsy. The oncologist seemed to be pretty sure it’s cancer, and the fact that she wanted to do surgery in three days gives me some anxiety. 

The hysterectomy that is scheduled is laparoscopic. Is it more dangerous to do a laparoscopic surgery with cancerous tissue? Especially with this particular cancer since it’s extremely aggressive?

I’d also appreciate any advice at all, recommendations for sarcoma centers, anything. 

Thank you so much for reading."

441,Dysautonomia ?,"24 F. 5’5, caucasian, around 98 pounds right now. i’m normally closer to 110 pounds but have been slowly losing weight recently and can’t put it back on. 

let me start by saying two years ago my family doctor finally diagnosed me with POTS after searching for answers about my fainting episodes since i was at least 10 years old. because it took so long to get answers i stopped telling anyone or complaining when i would faint or be sick as a kid. i just silently dealt with all of my symptoms to not be seen as a “hypochondriac”. finally when i was 20 with my own transport to a doctor i started looking for answers again. a few months after diagnosis i was hospitalized because i was having severe palpitations for over 3 days straight. again didn’t want to be seen as a hypochondriac so i waited until i couldn’t get up off the floor before i finally requested a ride to the ER. i was scoffed at in the hospital at first, because “you’re a healthy 20-something y/o girl” but when the doctor listened to my heart his tone immediately changed and the many doctors were in my room just to look at how crazy my EKG was. told it was SVT and that i “definitely have POTS” and they considered an ablation but decided to try metropolol instead. after experiencing side effects right away my dose was cut in half. almost a year later i was having really bad (what i assume to be) vertigo. it was a different sensation than my usual dizziness. i went to the doctor and was told my heart rate was 45 (i normally have tachycardia) and to stop the medication. none of my doctors really checked on me the entire year i was being medicated. fast forward some time and i’m feeling worse again, having flare ups and i was prescribed midodrine for low blood pressure. i had a ton of side effects from this, most persistent being headache and deep uneasy body chills/goosebumps/anxiety. i stopped taking it and again am having bad symptoms. i finally caved after getting no help from my family doctor and went to the ER and they immediately tried to send me home. (P.S. please believe women patients. i am suffering and i refuse to seek help until it’s unbearable due to doctors brushing me off constantly) i left that hospital and went to another right away where i had the same experience again, except this time i was given tylenol and sent home. while i was in the hospital my heart rate was 49 and the monitor was beeping like crazy and they didn’t care. i left the hospital and saw my family doctor  a few days later for a referral to a cardiologist. at the cardiologist i had 2 nurses and a doctor frantically taking my blood pressure to tell me it was 72/40 or 78/40 i can’t exactly remember which. sorry about that. the cardiologist didn’t express concern and then said “i don’t even think you have POTS” and sent me home. i’m waiting to find a specialist to help me confirm something. i’m not sure what to do or who to see and finding a doctor is so much harder than it should be. does anyone have any advice on what could be happening to me? i can’t afford to keep missing work and i’m missing a lot of work. i’m missing out on life. my mental health is spiraling. i have been uncontrollably/inconsolably crying for months. i feel sick but i “don’t look sick”. i truly feel like i’m at a dead end and to be consistently sent home as “fine” is weighing so heavy on me. does anyone have any advice on what type of doctor i should see or what test i should insist on? 

my most recent poor man tilt table test was :
laying down - 49 bpm
sitting - 71 bpm
standing - 92 bpm 
i unfortunately don’t have another one to compare it to off the top of my head but like i said earlier in the post i am normally tachycardia. 

the symptoms i’m currently experiencing are: 
no energy to cook or eat, i eat maybe 1 time a day and i’ve been having to run to the bathroom with stomach issues 2-4 times a day, too dizzy to stand most of the time, mostly taking baths because hot showers make it hard to stand, extreme sensitivity to temperatures (heat makes me faint & even slight cold hurts my body/bones so bad), i’m extremely sensitive to sound & light & even gentle touches can be painful for me, developing insomnia- sleeping 4-6 hours a night when 10 hours was normal before, flu like symptoms (body aches/chills), chest pain with occasional heart palpitations, and severe neck and shoulder/upper back pain.

Very healthy 


Hello! I want to know a doctor who is off the clock honest opinion on SARMS. 

SARMS have the effects of steroids but much less effective and with little to no side effects. They aren’t FDA approved but there have been tons of trials which show good results. 

I asked my doctor what he honestly thinks about them and he won’t say anything other than “I don’t recommend anything that isn’t approved.” Blah blah I can’t get his real opinion. 

So, what do doctors honestly think of them? I’m either doing that or a low dose of test for 2 months (my test level is on the low side I got a lab done) and I want to put on some muscle more effectively than doing it naturally. 

Thoughts? 

Thank you!"

I'm a little lost as to what this means. Is it so they can make sure it was a fault in the placement of the leads on my chest and not my heart? If someone could explain this to me, i would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!"
445,Bronquiolitis on 5 month old,"Age: 5 months 5M
Height:67 cm
Weight: 8kg

Hi there, 2 weeks ago our baby had a mild fever of 37.7 that went away after a bath. we went to the doctor and he said it might be an incubating viral infection.

A few days later he started coughing, at 7 days after the fever we brought him to another doctor who prescribed prednisolona (I'm sorry I don't know the names in English) and nebulizer of Fevutol (commercial name) and budesonida 

We finished treatment and coughing persisted, but lighter.

Yesterday we reached day 14 and the coughing got worse with another episode of mild fever (37.5) which went away with a bath.

We reached his doctor today and he recommended Aliren (commercial name) and he instructed prednisolona and nebulizer again, which we started. A few hours later he went as far down as 35.0 celsius in temperature. We reached the doctor at 35.2 and he said that if the baby is sweating then there's no concern on the temperature.

He also recommended medicine for the cough, but the other doctor advised against it since it can have side effects on the baby development of the brain.

Question is: as I've only talked to the doctor by phone and we might be overreacting, what should we expect from the following days?

Only symptoms he's shown are:
- intense coughing
- runny nose
- sleepiness (which he didn't have the previous weeks)
- irritability and trouble sleeping."
446,Did my Dr screw up a polypectomy?,Age:38 F 5'0 185. Location rectal. Severe anemia from rectal bleeding.  Two weeks ago on 10/18 I had a colonoscopy where a polyp was removed from my rectom and a clamp was put on it. Immediately after the procedure I went to the bathroom and the toilet was filled with blood. The nurse wouldn't flush it  and wanted the Dr to see it. He said it was ok and to call only if I started passing clots for two weeks I bled heavily. To the point of not being able to drive or really function. I called Thursday the 31 because I was short of breath and tachycardic. They had me go for blood work and scheduled me to be admitted the following morning with a different doctor in the practice. I went in they gave me.only something to relax my body. I was awake and felt everything. I sobbed through the entire procedure. After he told me he cauterized and added an additional clamp and to follow up in one week. Am I wrong to think doc 1 screwed up and doctor 2 caused me unnecessary pain. I can't sit properly and have barely been able to eat or have a BM. Thanks for any advise offered.

But, I never feel like I'm fully empty necessarily and I've experienced moderate lower stomach cramping on and off during this time. I've also realized that I've had little to no appetite during this time as well. I used to have a very healthy appetite but now nothing really seems appetizing. 

I've had no vomiting and really no nausea either (luckily). 

I don't really know what could cause this. About a month ago I had a semi-traumatic sudden onset health issue (allergic reaction) that sent me to the ER on my own and that's the first time I've ever had to deal with that by myself at college so it really spooked me. Had to take a precautionary week of Keflex (long story, but the docs didn't know if it was an allergic reaction or infection at first) but spaced it out with probiotics and never took on an empty stomach.

I've been very anxious these past few weeks and I can't tell if I'm anxious because of the stomach problems or have stomach problems because I'm anxious.

This all just came to a head now because I woke up out of a deep sleep with severe lower stomach cramping, went to the bathroom, at first only got a few pebbles out, but after 20 more minutes of severe cramping had watery diarrhea twice. I definitely have some relief but feel like the stomach cramps are beginning again. I have a huge exam in the morning and I'm totally by myself (roommates are asleep and I'm pretty far from home/my parents) so I'm hoping it's nothing. 


Any ideas of what this could be? Any cause for immediate concern? It's been worrying me but now I'm starting to think I may have some reason to actually be concerned."

i turned 21 two weeks ago.  my friends took me out and i got absolutely wasted.  i don't remember any of the night and they said that i couldn't speak.  they said i was unconcious and couldn't be roused. i guess i ended up doing some xanax and now i am pretty scared about a potential overdose.  i know that stuff can be cut with fentanyl if it's obtained from the streets, and that is a big problem in my area.

i don't get like this often, i actually rarely drink.  this is my first time doing drugs besides some weed a couple of times in my teens.

i read up on opiate overdoses and apparently hypoxia induced brain damage is a concern.  

if i did have a fentanyl or xanax caused overdose, would hypoxia-induced brain damage be pretty apparent?  would i have some sort of obvious symptoms?  or is it possible that i was experiencing an incredibly low respiration rate that was keeping me alive but causing brain damage nonetheless without any symptoms at all?

like, is it possible to experience hypoxia, wake up with no symptoms, and be walking around with mild or moderate brain damage without even knowing it?

My son came up to me tonight and said something like ""the mean cold wind hurt my hands, what do I do?"" - he is 19 years old, autistic and developmentally delayed, with communication impairments. I was shocked to see his hands so badly affected - we live in Texas and although we had a kind of ""cold snap"" it was nothing outrageous - mostly 50s-60s (some upper 40s this morning).

He loves to spend time outdoors, and spent quite awhile in our backyard today. He mostly just walks around, talking and singing to himself. 

I tried to ask him if something else happened to his hands, and he seemed confused - just said ""no, it was the cold wind being mean"" (something to that effect).

Because the cracks are bleeding, I did not want to apply lotion and risk hurting him- so I put some Neosporin ointment on them in the meantime. As I did so, I noticed the skin all over his hands is severely dry - like sandpaper. 

I'm really stumped here. Any ideas as to what this could be? Advice on how to treat this?"

5’11” 185 lbs.
No smoking or drinking.
Last weekend, I woke up around 7 in the morning and went to get out of bed, I was about to swing my legs out and something in my left hip popped. I instantly winced in pain and my leg fell back to the bed. I just found a comfortable position and went back to bed.  Once I woke up I realized that I could barely move my left leg at all. It took me almost 2 whole minutes to even get out of bed because when I left leg was flat on the bed, when I went to lean up it hurt in my left hip. Well after I finally stand up, I can barely walk at all. I limp at best. It felt like I couldn’t pick my leg up at all. This went one for the whole weekend and gradually went away. However this weekend,  when I woke up today, there was no pop or anything, I just had the exact same pain in my leg as the weekend before.  This has been a constant pain all day and I have been pretty much bedridden.  If I’m standing up, I can’t raise my left leg more than an inch or 2 off the ground until I have to physically pick my leg up more. When I lay down, it takes so long to even get sitting up right then even more time I get completely out of bed.  Fortunately. I just got insurance after being without it for over the past year.  What should be my main course of action?

Edit: i forgot to add that it also hurts to rotate my left leg inward or outward, and that it spasms randomly and almost takes my breath way when it happens bc of the pain."

I almost fell because putting pressure on my right leg hurt like I had previously pulled a muscle even though I know there’s no way I could’ve done that. I had a minor limp for a few minutes as I was walking around and it hurt to walk, but the more I walked the more I got used to it (but the pain never fully went away).

I went back to my desk for a few hours and when I went to go clock out the same thing happened. Ever since then every time I stand up/walk around or push on my upper right calf (towards the inside), it hurts like I pulled something and need a massage. Theres no redness, there MIGHT be minor swelling but I could just be imagining it, and there’s no heat. Other than the fact that it hurts it looks/feels perfectly normal.

I have high (but not very high) cholesterol, take birth control pills, work at a desk where I don’t get up for hours at a time, don’t really watch my diet, and I live a pretty sedentary lifestyle. I’ve been called a hypochondriac in the past, but this sounds like DVT. Should I get it checked out?"

467,Is something wrong with my brain? Could I have an aneurism?,"26 years old/female/5’3”, 135 lbs/no medication besides Mirena IUD/do not smoke or drink/no ongoing health issues besides the below 

Thank you in advance for any advice. 

Eleven days ago I received a minor concussion. I went to the doctor and everything seemed pretty normal, although no imaging was taken of my brain. I was told to rest and cut back on screen time and not to drink alcohol, and to call the office back if I had any weird symptoms. 

Everything seemed to be fine until last night. I was on my phone and suddenly had difficulty reading—the best way to describe it is that it was as if I were reading a foreign language. The words didn’t make sense in the contexts, my brain was having trouble processing the words, and I felt somewhat confused. I also had trouble thinking of words I wanted to say. Additionally, there was a dark spot and a flashing rainbow spot in the field of vision of my right eye which covered up whatever else I was looking at. I was alarmed but figured I was mostly tired; I told my fiancé about the spot in my vision and went to bed. 

In the middle of the night I woke up with one of the worst headaches I’ve ever had. I felt it all on the left side of my head, especially in my neck as stiffness, in the top left side of my head, and behind my left eye as a very sharp pain. It hurt so badly that I got up and cried, and it was accompanied by mild nausea. Also I should note that at this point, the confusion and weird visual stuff was gone. 

I woke up my fiancé and told him and he was very alarmed. He seemed to be concerned, from what he was reading online, that it could be an aneurism. I was very reluctant to go to the ER so he called in, explained what was going on, and they said they’d have an on call doctor call us back. The doctor never called back and I was able to fall back asleep. 

When I woke up this morning my headache had mostly subsided, although it is still sort of there but dull. However, when I have sneezed this morning there is a ton of pressure and pain in my forehead. I emailed my doctor’s office and expect to hear back tomorrow, but I wonder if this is something I should have checked out asap. 

If it is relevant, I have a Mirena IUD that I’ve had for about three years that I’ve read can be associated with something called intercranial hypertension.

Female

Smoker (marijuana and cigarettes)


 She’s been to the doctor a few times and they have continually suggested that the vomiting is anxiety induced. She does indeed suffer from severe anxiety and depression so that is very possible. 

She’s been given medicine that is supposed to help with nausea but a lot of the time she’ll just throw it back up. She spends most of her time in the bathroom, hunched over a toilet with no end in sight. She’s lost about twenty pounds over the past couple months. It was a couple days ago that doctors took blood to look at the bladder and liver. The doctors seem puzzled about the situation.

He had an appointment last Monday for a cold. Coughing, sneezing, runny nose. No fever. Doctor said it’s most likely viral, suction nose, keep him comfortable and to watch for wheezing. He didn’t prescribe any medication. 

His cold seems to be getting much better, however now I can hear fine crackles when he exhales. I can’t find my stethoscope but I don’t hear any wheezing. He’s not coughing as much and still no fever. It sounds like it’s coming from his upper airway. Is this any cause for concern? He’s not having any trouble breathing and definitely no retractions."

A few weeks ago I popped it, and it went down considerably in size, but now it periodically lets out a bit of mucous if I squeeze it. A week ago, I noticed I had a bunch of tiny mucoceles on my bottom lip, along with the bigger yet still small one that originally was there. Is this a sign of anything that is more than just benign? How to I get rid of these? My doctor recommended gargling salt water 4 times a day a few days ago, and I've been doing that. I just wanna be in the know on what's going on. Thank you."

486,[Male][32] How long should a schizophrenia diagnosis take?,"A friend has been having a mental health crisis. They have been extremely paranoid and delusional and have had auditory hallucinations.  They went from being a successful engineer to being homeless.  I talked them into going to the ER and requesting a mental health check. That resulted in a 10 day stay in the psych ward.  At the end of it, my friend claimed that there was no diagnosis but they’re basically fine and that the doctor said they were “rational”. Obviously, I have no way of verifying any of this, but I’m skeptical that someone can present those symptoms, spend 10 days in the hospital and have no diagnosis.  Ultimately, they were referred to a program for people transitioning from a mental health inpatient stay, but it was run out of a homeless shelter and my friend refused to stay there.  Assuming that he wasn’t diagnosed, I suspect that if my friend had money or good insurance then the doctors would have kept him until he was diagnosed.  But I have no way of verifying that suspicion.   So I’m wondering if it’s likely that an indignant person would be released from a psych ward without a diagnosis. And I’m wondering how long a diagnosis might take for schizophrenia and other mental illnesses that may present similar symptoms."
487,"Sensation in my throat, almost like a heart palpitation","I'm 17 years old, female, 130 lbs, 5'2.

Sometimes the feeling can last up to 30 seconds but most of the time it happens for 10 or so seconds, and they can happen back to back. I did go to my doctor about this and got no answer, my blood test came back normal too. Normally something like this wouldn't bother me, but it freaks me out when it happens because I have no idea what it is :(.

493,[22/M] Erection issues making me deeply depressed and anxious,"22, 150lbs, 5’10”, regularly work out, suffer from depression and anxiety.

So I’ve had this weird erection issue for a year or so and the stress is taking its toll. I get morning wood that lasts quite a long time most days, but the moment I stand up my erection immediately starts to go down.

I’ve also noticed when masturbating the moment I stop stimulating my erection goes down within 10-20 seconds. However when I’m in a seated position my erections are stronger and seem to last longer. If I masturbate standing my erections only get to about 80-90% hardness before I ejaculate.

This honestly makes me super nervous to have sex with a girl because my erections seem to rely a lot on physical stimulation. Plus for some weird reason my standing erections seem weaker and less reliable.

I’m only 22 and in good shape, I’m worried this could ruin my life and is something serious like a venous leak.

I’m finally going to go to my doctor and talk about this tomorrow, but till then, does anyone have any opinions on what this could be? I’m terrified. A guy my age should have long lasting erections without trying."
494,"Follow up post: Baby son vomiting/diarrhea for a week, now has a fever and is very drowsy.","Our 9-month-old started vomiting last Sunday. Stopped that night and didn’t vomit again until Tuesday. His diarrhea began on Tuesday and he threw up once more, later in the week. He hasn’t vomited in several days, but still has diarrhea. This afternoon, he suddenly developed a 102.9°F fever and is very extremely sleepy - can’t stay awake for more than a half hour. His skin is clammy and cheeks are flushed. He’s still eating purées normally and is drinking most of his bottles. He’s having regular wet diapers. On Friday, his iron was slightly low. 

Should we take him to the children’s hospital? Monitor him overnight and take him to his pediatrician in the morning if he’s no better? I’m not sure what to do, but I want him to feel better and be well. 

Original post: My son is 9 months old, in the 99th percentile for height, 63rd for weight, and growing/developing normally. His diet consists mostly of formula, with three meals a day of puréed vegetables and fruits. He’s followed this diet for 2 months, consistently, with no issues. 

This may just be a virus, but I’d like to know what else could be a possibility. We are taking him to the doctor and I’m afraid they may just dismiss it as a virus without considering other possibilities. And it may be, but his sickness has been odd. 

A month ago, he went through the same thing. He vomited 2x on day 1. We gave him pedialyte and puréed bananas and apples for 24 hours after that. The doctor told us to mix his formula with pedialyte instead of water for a couple days, so on day 3, we did that. He did great and stopped vomiting, but had diarrhea. Then, vomited again on day 5. He finally stopped diarrhea and vomiting a week and a half after it began. 

He is currently in day 6 of round 2. He vomited on Sunday, did fine on Monday, sent him to daycare on Tuesday and they called before 9 am bc he had diarrhea. He’s had explosive, frequent diarrhea since then, but no more vomiting..until this morning. 

He eats normally and is still urinating regularly. Between these bouts, he hasn’t had any issues with any of the foods we give him. Just a happy, healthy little guy. 

If there’s anything this could be that isn’t a virus, please tell me what it could be. We’re desperate for answers. Tia!

Edited to add: no one else has caught this from him, either time, and no one in his daycare class or family have been sick."
495,Is it remotely possible that untreated skull malformation is causing my neurological symptoms?,"I fear I’m becoming a frequent flyer here. Sorry. I’ll keep it brief.

Meds: Progesterone only BC. Multivitamin. 500 mg magnesium.  
Location: head/most of body. US.  
Mild drinking, no smoking, no drugs.  
  
I’ve always had a pointed ridge on the rear top of my skull in the middle. My skull is mildly ridged all the way to my forehead (very mildly) and my forehead is slightly pointed. It’s quite mild, the ridge near the back is the most profound and it’s easy to feel under my hair. If I were bald it would be visible, you get the idea.  
  
Google-fu tells me this is probably a mild form of Sagittal craniosynostosis. I know, it’s bad to try to diagnose yourself. Maybe that’s not what it is, but I’m kind of at my wit’s end with my body.  
  
The short of it is that I’ve had MS-like symptoms for the past 5 years or so, progressively worsening over time. MRI and bloodwork came back clear. I get frequent severe migraines, have recurrent optic neuritis, numbness and tingling in various parts of my body, weakness and tremors in my right arm, profound fatigue,  and near constant muscle jolts-several every minute. There are more but I won’t get into them for the sake of time and space. 
  
I’m a very busy and active person. I don’t sit around dwelling on my symptoms, they’re just always there. 
  
Is it in any way possible my skull has anything to do with this? My neuro has been pretty dismissive of me since my MRI results. Is it even worth mentioning? Wouldn’t I have had major symptoms way before now? Cognitively I have always been above average, so I’m dubious that it is the cause, but at the point where I need to turn over every stone for answers.

501,Hurt like hell and not sure what to do,"35M. I was in a scooter accident about 3 months ago (I live on an island where it’s the primary method of transportation). Since then I’ve been suffering from semi-constant back pain. It got better for a short period but has been getting progressively worse recently. I’m pretty sure there’s a spinal issue for more than a couple reasons. My Dr doesn’t seem to be taking it seriously, but he did tell me to get some massages and see how it goes, then if it didn’t get better he’d consider sending me to get an MRI.

The core issue has been two spots on my mid to upper back. Left mid and upper right. After the accident I couldn’t sleep properly for weeks as there wasn’t a way I could lay down comfortably. Over time it got better, but then I got into busy season at work and was sitting at my desk for 11 hours a day 7 days a week for ~3 weeks. Things started to tighten up and get bad again. My entire back got tight, and the pain/tightness carried up to my shoulders which have been ridiculously tight for a week or two now.

When things died down at work I went and got a couple massages (2 in the past 3 days). It helped in some ways (I’m a bit less tight) but at the current moment my shoulders are literally on fire. I almost want to cry. I’ve taken ibuprofen but it’s not helping. Tomorrow is a holiday here so I can’t go into the doctors until Tuesday (I’ll push for the MRI then), but I’m not sure what the appropriate response is now. I’m not sure why I hurt and what I can do about it. I don’t feel like the emergency room is the corresponds here.

512,"Stomach Isuses (Mostly Related To Eating) - Male, 20 Years Old","Hello.

I am having stomach issues and I'm not sure what to do anymore. The issues include:

* \- gas, bloating, blurping (usually together) immediately or shortly after eating;
* \- bad breath no matter how much I brush teeth. I brush in the morning and immediately after dinner but still wake up with bad breath.
* \- hair loss. Not a stomach issue but I think it's related because my body seems to refuse some vitamins and supplements that encourage hair growing. I've tried the biotin supplement and some other medicine which made me throw up. I did mention this to the doctor that prescribed biotin and he replied ""yeah, it can cause reactions such as this"". My hair is dry and and comes off easily, I've also had an incident which lead to me loosing some parts of the hair and it does not grow back for some reason. All of the other hair (arms, legs, facial) grow as usual but hair - doesn't.
* \- I want to throw up after eating any kind of meat, especially pork. Chicken, turkey and beef cause light to moderate nausea but pork is guaranteed to have me throw up (I don't eat it anymore because of that). I have the same issue with apples, eggs and black tea. Apples that are more sour don't cause this. Also I've noticed that eating mandarines and oranges helps me with the ""throw up"" feeling which is strange because I used to have an allergy on oranges when I was in high school...
* \- I used to eat milk products of any quality without any issues but now it's problematic. Milk is out of question, ice-cream, cheese, some sort of cake are more or less okay but they cause gas and bloating, so I don't eat them. I've tried using the lact. pills but they didn't change much;
* \- additionally I want to mention that the issues occur no matter what I eat. Sometimes I take notes on what I eat and try to see how my body reacts to it and honestly, there's no difference for me between eating a high-fat cheesecake or hamburger, or eating vegetables and soup, and honey all day - it's all the same and I get bloating, gas, blurping no matter what. I also don't seem to gain any weight, regardless of how much I eat and that's how it was since I was little: I was 100-110 pounds when I was in high school (when my meals were better) and I'm the same weight now.
* \- uncontrollable blurping. I've never had this before but lately I've been having this weird blurping that occurs without me ""allowing"" it: not sure how to describe it, but it's like my throat lets out air by itself which makes me stressed because it can happen when I'm around other people. The sound is similar to as if I was gargling with water.
* \- I've also noticed that I cannot drink more than one glass of water per each period of taking food (three times per day). If I drink more than that, I'm guaranteed to have dhiarrea.
* \- last thing. I think it's important to note that I drink sleep-aid syrup on a daily basis. Without it, I cannot fall asleep. I've had the problem with sleep for a very long time now and usually I'd roll around in bed for hours. I started drinking the sleep-aid syrup which helps me to fall asleep. And I did try the various sleep supplements but none of them helped in any way, sleep-aid is the only thing that actually helps me to fall asleep. That said, I'm using the ones without corn syrup, the bottle says ""no alcohol, corn syrup"" and some other stuff. I thought it's worth to mention.

Can anyone advise anything? I brought this up to my doctor and I explained my symptoms, they checked my urine and blood, and said I don't have diabetes; my blood and other stuff (that they checked) is good. The doctor told me to use famitidine 20mg (Acid Reducer) - he told me to use 2 pills for a month. The symptoms were mostly the same but a bit less, maybe 40% less? When I stopped using the pills, it came back to 100%. I'm not sure what to eat anymore and having these symptoms makes me feel bad."

515,my skin is turning blue,"im not sure if this is the right sub to be asking this question but i'll go for it anyways.

6 days ago (monday) i got food poisoning. late tuesday night i got up to use the bathroom and sat there for like 15+ minutes. after i was done i got up and noticed the toilet seat had turned blue/purplish. it couldn't have been dye or anything because i wasn't wearing anything blue on my legs.. and i hadn't been that whole week. the next couple days i noticed the skin on the inside of my thighs were now blue as well. naturally being curious i looked up blue toilet seat and found that i wasn't alone, however almost all the accounts of this weird thing happening were from pregnant women. let me get this straight: i am female. i do not have a partner and i am young, neither am i interested in dating or sex. so i can't be pregnant.

anyways.. the blue color hasn't faded or washed off or anything. this morning i used the bathroom again and went to wash my hands. after i was done i looked at my left hand and half of it had the same blue coloration. i'm freaking out and i don't know if its connected to my food poisoning or if i should tell somebody.

here is a picture of my hand (left side is tinted blue):  [https://imgur.com/NHaMTSt](https://imgur.com/NHaMTSt)"
516,Help I [F26] need some insight!,"Hello everyone!

This is quite a long story, so please bear with me! 
Basically a year and a half ago I starting feeling very unwell suddenly. I woke up from a post-exam nap feeling very nauseous and had a very bad episode of diarrhoea and sulfur burps (like really loud and bad ones). Unfortunately, at the time I didn’t have medical insurance because I’m broke.
For two months in a row I would have bad case of cramps and diarrhoea with burps at night, and only manage to sleep in the early morning hours. This literally changed my life as I was living in the night and sleeping during the day because exhausted. I kept my diet to a minimum (bread and water) but at times it wouldn’t work.
As a result I put on a massive amount of weight. 
After two months, the symptoms finally subsided and I started taking some probiotics and it seemed to work.
However, ever since then my stool has not been the same since. It is yellow and occasionally my stomach will have a lot of gas movement (like a boiling feeling) and would pass a lot of bad air. Plus, I noticed very tiny white seed-like things in it. It’s not worms because nothing like that has ever shown itself. 
I never really thought of much because university takes over my life a lot and my parents, honestly, are not really of useful help. 
A week and a half ago was another turning point. I ate some dodgy Chinese food and the symptoms all came back at once. Up all night with explosive diarrhoea, sulfur burps and serious cramping. I finally had insurance and contacted a doctor (now my current GP, which a year and a half ago was not easy to find as you need to register here and nobody was literally available).
I had blood tests and an ultrasound. I do not have gallbladder stones (what my doctor suspected). But now I’m anxious about my blood results. I’ve tried to go on a diet in the meantime but nothing seems to make me shed the weight. 
Do you maybe have any insights? 

Thank you!! 
If you have any questions please do ask."

Hi,  I've been having bright red blood in my stool for three weeks, I've  seen a doctor and had a DRE, he then gave me a referral for a flexible  sigmoidoscopy which is coming up on Thursday. Today I had a new symptom  and passed a small dark blood clot with my poop, as well as bright red  blood. I know dark blood and clots are considered to be more serious,  but i cant find any information on how urgent it actually is. All the  walk-ins are closed right now, is it worth going to the ER, or would it  be reasonable to hold tight till my scope on thursday? I Do Not have any  symptoms of heavy bleeding like fatigue or pale skin or anything, but I  do have some vague discomfort on one side of my abdomen, with occasional feelings similar to a light painless muscle spasm.

The only other health problem I have is psoriasis around my anus, ankle and top of head, and I use Dovobet gel for it

524,"[Male, 29] Recurring Tonsil Issues/Strep","Age: 29

Sex: Male

Height: 185cm/6'1

Weight: 100kg/220lbs

Race: Caucasian

Duration of complaint: Three weeks

Location: Finland

Any existing relevant medical issues: None

Current medications: Paracetamol and Panacod (Paracetamol + Codein) as needed, haven't needed the latter more than a few times.

I'm posting this here because this whole situation is very strange and unusual for me, as I've never had symptoms recurring and receding so rapidly, or really any kind of reoccurring illnesses in general aside from 20 years ago as a child.

About 3 weeks ago, I was diagnosed with Strep C/G, with CRP of 140 and fever of 39C at it's highest, very sore throat, no cough. Got a 10 day course of antibiotics, fever and sore throat cleared up.

A few days later, dry cough started and lasted a few days before clearing up. I felt healthy for about 4 days, before suddenly the sore throat came back (On tuesday, writing this on sunday), very localized to left side. Looked in my throat and saw white patches, particularly on the left tonsil (no ""lumps"") which had a visible crypt. No fever this time. Went to doctor again, had my throat swabbed for the test. Soreness disappeared almost entirely with no antibiotic treatment within a day. Results of the throat swab came back negative for Strep this time. Doctor said it was likely viral in nature then. Since then, I boiled my toothbrush, which is something I had to do once as a child when I had recurring Strep.

Was almost entirely asymptomatic since then, until today on Sunday, seems the soreness is coming back. Looked in my throat again and I still see the white on my left tonsil.

Not sure what's going on, normally nothing recurs for me and I am generally healthy. What makes this even more odd is how quickly the soreness seems to come and go. This past tuesday when the pain started again, it began in the morning and got steadily worse during the day, and then was almost entirely gone the next day again (the white in my throat was still very much present).

I had unprotected sex with a partner preceding both the Strep C diagnosis and on the weekend preceding the tuesday when the soreness came back. I discussed this with a doctor, but since neither of us have had any symptoms pointing towards STD's, no tests have been ordered as of yet. To clarify, the partner I had has been healthy with no symptoms of any kind.

Could whatever virus/bacteria that is causing this still be alive on some other object in my apartment? A pillow case? A towel?

Thank you in advance."

From my research im assuming I should avoid alcohol at both events, is this accurate? I've read conflicting advice online to wait 48 hours, 72 hours, and up to a week. I would just like to know when I can expect bactrim to be out of my system, before having a drink to experience no drug interactions.

528,Heart - a murmur? Palps? Arrhythmia?,"22F, 5’6” or 66”, 126lb, white, rarely drink, no tobacco, almost never drink energy drinks, coffee not often. 
When I was a kid about 11/12yo is when I first recall it happening.  I was more high strung at about 12/13yo because of my home environment and became very depressed by 13-14yo, but I was in good shape and did sports and had never really touched alcohol or tobacco and rarely had energy drinks. I was exposed to second hand smoke often but that was when I was younger and had already stopped for years before that. I have never really liked soda. I won’t give too much more info unless asked because since it was already happening before anything else I did in life, so I assume it’s clear that that did not cause it. But long story short - I ended up with depression and alcohol dependency , then quit drinking around 14/15 and started smoking weed and then quit that at about 18 to join the military. I’ve only had a couple puffs of a cigarette, and never finished a full one in my life. I was still a pretty good runner later in life with a 22min 3mile time and in high school I also enjoyed weight lifting. I’m currently seeing a counselor for anxiety bc I have issues with frequent crying and breaking out in hives. 

Since I was about 11-12yo (I’m 22 now) I’ve had instances where my heart starts beating faster and hard. Not like “I just ran” hard and fast ( I ran track and am active duty and it does not feel like this after running or workouts) but like “this concerns me and does not feel right” and it can be easily felt through my chest or back by others around me. 
It seems mostly random. I do not feel stressed most of the times it has happened. I even have been bored a lot of them or feeling calm.
One time it woke me from sleep, no nightmare. It seems it happens when I’m standing more than sitting. It has started 3-5 times now by me bending down and standing back up. 
Usually if I take a slow deep breath it will stop it on the spot. Sometimes it doesn’t work. It can last from 1-2 beats to 2-3 minutes. Last time it happened I was able to use a smart watch and my heart rate was 160bpm ( May have been 163 or so but definitely above 160) My average heart rate is 50-60s when sleepy or relaxed, 80s with normal activity throughout the day, and 90s with higher activity. 
I WAS wearing an Event Monitor for about a month, and in this month it never was recorded happening. They said at some point a “rare arrhythmia “ was detected but there was no reaction or something like that, so I was told the diagnosis was palpitations and they may be from anxiety. They said come back if it starts happening 3/4 times a week.  
Another doctor told me I had a murmur at one point as well but then a different one said I do not."
529,66F Mom doesn't want biopsy to test for Inclusion Body Myositis,"My mom is: 66, female, ex-smoker (quit for over 20 years), maybe 5'5 and probably about 9 stone. She has had a ""minor"" heart attack in the past, and was on statins for a couple of years (until mid-2018).

My mom has had deteriorating muscle strength for the past few years (trouble sitting/standing, can only eat liquid food, etc.). She's had to wait an incredibly long time on the NHS waiting lists for appointments, etc.

Her recent appointment with a neurologist indicated that it most likely is IBM, but that they would like to do blood tests and a biopsy to rule other (more treatable) things out. She's done the blood tests but doesn't want to do the biopsy. She mentioned these concerns to the neurologist, and he easily convinced her to have it done. However, since then, she's ""read more stuff online"", and has decided she doesn't want it done. She says even if they discover IBM there's nothing they can do about it anyway apart from new experimental treatments that don't work. The muscle biopsy will also be performed on the arm (or, rather, the deltoid) if they do it, which can make it difficult to use that arm for a while. She says she can't lose use of the arm since she needs it to be able to stand up at all from sitting-down position, amongst other things.

My questions are:

(1) How valid are her concerns? I don't want to pressure her to reconsider if she's basically just right, and there *is* no point in having a biopsy.

(2) If I *should* try to convince her to take the biopsy, how should I do this? What are the best reasons that might convince her?

(3) Isn't the point that she should do it not to test for IBM, but to test for other things that *are* treatable? If so then this means she shouldn't use the incurableness of IBM as a reason for not having the biopsy.

Thanks! :)"

It would twitch and spasm for 6,7 seconds every 2nd minute for hours together till it would stop suddenly for the day and would resume the next day. This would continue for weeks together. I dismissed it and tried not to give it much attention. But it would return after a month or two again for weeks together. Has been happening since. Now the newest addition is my left eye lid twitch.

Sex: Female

Height 5ft

Weight 216 pounds

Race African- Canadian

Medication taken as needed: Apo- Pantarazole

Beginning in March 2017, I began experiencing heart palpitation all of a sudden. After a sudden episode of these palpitations, I was taken to the emergency in a full mode panic attack and discovered that I had a critically low phosphate of 0.34. With that been said, I was seen by a cardiologist, and an ultrasound was performed, and all looked well and was told if I had these episodes occur once again, I should come in. 

With that been said in 2018, I went a prolonged time without experiencing any palpitations, and my electrolytes were also balanced, so I thought I was in the clear. In April of 2019, I experienced a sudden episode of palpitation, which led me to the hospital to only find out my phosphate had lowered itself once again. Since April of 2019, I then began experiencing these episodes about twice a week every single month, and even though my phosphate is not stable, I cannot begin to think about what else I should do.

I had multiple ECGs done and a holter monitor test in July, which confirmed I had the most common type of palpitations in which I believe at the PVC's, and to this very day, I'm still experiencing my heart skipping a beat. Lately, I have also felt like a sharpness from my heart before it skipping a beat.

I do understand they are not harmless, but they send me into full-blown panic attack modes and a bunch of other sudden dooming thoughts.

With that been said, I do not wish to continue going to the emergency room for these episodes or not living a fully healthy life.

Is there anything I can do to stop palpitations entirely? Can the heart eventually correct its rhythm?

I do have a normal blood pressure and all other blood work performed are good except my C- reactive protein did make a jump from 2.5(2017) to 6.6 ( 2018) and I'm scheduled for a blood work to see if it has reduced late this month.

Previously diagnosed with hypertension at 16 (I think I was wrongly diagnosed) 

So everyday, I wake up my heart rates faster for about 30 minutes, to an hour. Not directly after waking up, but whenever I get out of bed and start doing my morning routines. 

My normal resting heart rate is anywhere from 55-65. Whenever I wake up and I’m laying in bed, it’s still normal. But whenever I get outta bed and start doing stuff, it’ll be 100-115 standing, and 80-95 sitting. 

It then resumes normal pace after about an hour. 

Is this a normal body response or something I should get checked out? I wore a halter monitor for 2 days about 3 weeks ago and had a CBC with Metabolic panel and all that was clean."
534,Aches in legs that seem to only occur at night/when I’m cold,"Age: 17
Sex: Female
Height: 5’2
Weight: 98 lb
Race: Asian
Duration of complaint: lifelong, but it is on and off
Location: California(relevant because of temperature, will elaborate), pain is on lower legs mostly.
Any existing relevant medical issues: various mental issues, but unsure if relevant
Current medications: just stopped temporary birth control for period that lasted two weeks. pain occured before medication.

The pain often wakes me up, usually early morning. It’s very similar to growing pains, but I am no longer growing. It usually happens when I’m cold, as it rarely happened during the warm California summer or during the day. I’m not sure what makes it go away, but heat improves it, and eventually it goes away on its own. I will describe a few incidents(different days) to demonstrate how they often differ:

- I wake up at around 4 am or so, with that horrible pain in my calves and feet. It is still dark outside. It’s very cold, so I try to bury myself in the blanket, until I fall asleep again. The pain is gone when I wake up again in the morning.

- I wake up at 5 or 6 with mild pain in left leg. I am cold, but I am unable to get warm or go back to sleep. I get up and walk around, which improves the pain slightly, until I think I can go back to sleep. A few minutes after I get back into bed, the pain worsens severely. I get up to take an advil, deciding not to try to sleep again. An hour later, the pain has faded.

- I wake up at 8 am with no pain. At around 11, the pain starts, but it’s mild. I am slightly nauseated and generally not feeling well, and strangely, not very coordinated or strong as I usually am. The pain worsens. It is 3 pm, and it seems it has reached its peak. My feet feel cold, likely due to sweating. My legs are warm to the touch though, not burning. Oddly, my calves, where the pain is located, is slightly colder than my thighs. There is nothing that helps the pain, I do not have access to painkillers.

I wonder if the pain is related to strain, as I am active due to my physical class(I have been doing set construction for a few years now and I work out three days a week. I also am very hyperactive and tend to run around/pace for no reason for hours a day.) 

However, this pain rarely happens in the summer, and seems to only occur when it’s cold. It also doesn’t feel like typical muscle strain pain I feel a day after a tough workout. It feels like the growing pains I used to get as a child. I wonder if the cold causes it or the leg simply feels cold as a symptom of whatever is happening to cause this pain. Any answers would be helpful. Thank you."

Most of the time I only experience heart pain when I’m laying down (on the left or right side, not when I’m laying down straight), but sometimes I also feel it in the centre of my chest when I’m sitting down. 

I told my doctor and at first she said it was because of my GAD but I asked her to let me do an ECG to put my mind at ease. ECG showed that my heartbeat was regular even tho at times I feel it beating so fast that I can feel the heartbeat in my feet. 

Anyway, now my doctor says I’m worrying for no reason because I had done blood tests previously too and they were fine.

For more details, I’m a 22 yr old overweight female, diagnosed with diabetes, depression and GAD. Currently on no medication.

What could the heart pain and the shortness of breath(even when just walking 400-500 feet or going up flight of stairs be related to? Which tests should I ask my doctor to prescribe me?

It's driving me insane. It was also similar to the feeling of discharge coming out, which is making me check for discharge pretty much 24/7 but nothing is coming out.

I went to my rheumatologist last week for my regular appointment, and while there, was given my yearly flu shot. I have chronic joint pain due to my AS and EDS, but have never before had joint pain in my shoulder before. I was concerned when receiving my flu shot that the medical assistant's placement of the shot seemed strange (it wasn't in my deltoid muscle, but rather on the back of my shoulder? Photo included above), and during the shot, I did not feel anything at all (normally I feel a pinch and very small amount of pain for a few seconds). Usually my flu shots make my arm a little sore for the rest of the day, but then it is better. This time, the pain feels more in my shoulder joint and is getting more and more severe every day. I am worried that the injection was placed incorrectly and there is something wrong.

How would you recommend I proceed? Should I be concerned or is this likely nothing? Should I be following up with my doctor? If so, should I reach out to my rheum or should I speak to my PCP or urgent care?

I’m experiencing a slight reddish/brownish discharge a week before my period and it really freaked me out as it’s never happened before. I did forget to take a pill a few days ago and I doubled up like normal. Could that cause the spotting? I’ve been on birth control for 5 years.

I also work in a library which means I use my hands a lot, but I don’t recall injuring my fingernail. I do fidget with my fingernails occasionally due to my anxiety and OCD.

Is this cause for concern?

544,[21M] Underlying Heart Disease? Don't know what's wrong,"Hey!

***21M, 210 lbs, 6'3, No history of diabetes or heart issue, No genetic relation in family, Health anxiety sine jan 2018.***

&#x200B;

Hey you all! I'm very worried and I don't know what is causing this anymore. Thinking the worst, Heart failure, heart disease, Angina (clogged arteries) or some kind of Cardiomyopathy. I've tried so many things but nothing helps. The pain I'm feeling can present itself in various ways. The first one is like a pinching muscle. It's right under my left breast and it feels like someone is pinching my muscle. The other one is to the left of the sternum, which is just pain, pressure like. The 3rd one is towards my upper left chest and close to the shoulder, feels like a pressure. Then there is the arm pain that also feels like a pressure but it does not hurt. Can someone here relate to this story or can indeed tell me that I am FINE? Thanks in advanced and please have a read and give your thoughts on this.

**I did 1 major blood work, including cholesterol which were all within the normal range! I also like to mention that I have been asking for echos/x-rays and a stress test but all of the docs told me it was not needed.**

**2019-02-26:** First case of my chest pain. Started off on the left side and kept going for 2 weeks.

**2019-03-11:** I had now felt the chest pain for 2 weeks. I went to my Urgent care and the doc listened to my heart and lungs, took blood work and did an ECG. The results came back a few days later and the ECG was normal, sound was normal and heart blood work was normal. All that was worrying was my low b12 and folate which he gave me medicines for and that fixed that problem. Told me it was muscular related.

The months between the next visit had it ups and down, chest pain sometimes and sometimes not, always on the left side.

**2019-05-24:** My next visit to a different doctor. I came for the same thing. Left sided chest pain, now with left sided arm pain/shoulder pain aswell. He took me in, Started listening to my heart, took my oxygen level (was at 98%) and later took an ECG. It all came back normal. Told me it was tietze syndrome.

**2019-06-11:** The pain has gotten worse, this time i knew for a fact it was heart related (ye right). Went to ANOTHER doctor, the same old thing happened, Stethoscope, Oxygen level, Palpating and ECG was done. All normal. Was told it was muscular.

**2019-09-30:** Latest visit and this time is was must had been my heart (i hoped). Left sided chest pain, arm pain, shoulder pain you name it. You know the drill, ECG, Stethoscope, Oxygen level And Palpation began. Tests came back, Normal. Told it was muscular once again.

**Today:** Still having left sided chest pains, its driving me crazy and I don't know what it is, trying to be rational but it does not seem to work.

&#x200B;

**Total tests: 4 ECG's, 4 Listenings using a stethoscope, 1 Major blood work, 3 Oxygen levels done, All tests were normal.**

Thank you all for reading, can anyone tell me what's going on? Is it really muscular or can it indeed be a heart problem?"
545,I [33][M] have been having some strange symptoms with my mouth/throat. Should I be worried?,"Im a 33 year old man from the US. I’m about 5’8” and 170lbs. I’m not on any meds and have no known medical conditions other than moderate Tourettes. I have no known allergies and nothing like this has ever happened. 

I’ve had some strange issues with my mouth/throat the last few days and I want to know if I should be worried. A little less than a week ago I got a mild sore throat and some irritation under the base of my tongue. The next day I had a feeling that my mouth and throat were very dry even when drinking LOTS of water/tea and producing seemingly normal amounts of saliva and using lozenges. That lasted about a day and a half. Yesterday evening I had a very mild 99.7 degree fever which went away by morning. I have not a fever at all today. 

The weird thing is what has happened today. I had a fairly painful irritated spot under the very back of my tongue in my right side. I massaged it wondering if it was a salivary stone and discovered that with a little massaging I could move the point of irritation all the way down to the base of my neck. If feels like it is directly adjacent to my esophagus just a bit deeper than the artery in my neck. 

If left alone it is only moderately painful and always makes it way back up to the top of my throat/base of
My mouth somewhat quickly. 

Pressing on it/massaging it relieves the pain but also moves it up or down. Should I be worried? What the hell is going on?"
546,Fractured vision - really concerned. Is this normal??

As time has gone on (maybe 10-15 mins since I noticed it), the cracks seem to have spidered out a little wider, so I can see the strands, as opposed to just a small patch of many cracks.

547,Drinking after taking Flagyl,"I was taking 500mg of flagyl 3 times a day and took my last dosage of it about 48 hours ago. My doctor told me absoultely no alcohol within 24 hours but when I was reading online about this drug, I have seen that you should wait 48-72 hours. However, I think my dosage was a little higher than what most people get so I think i may need to add even more time.

I am on vacation to Germany and would love to enjoy some beer while here. I am planning on drinking no alcohol for at least another 24 hours and I am wondering if I should I wait any more time past 72 hours?

551,Unknown illness,"Hello 

I am a 21 year old female and in the beginning of this year I had a few episodes of heart arrhythmia and tachycardia and went to see a specialist in January. They found no obvious cause but noted that my spleen was enlarged as well as my lymph nodes around my neck and under my arms. 

As the year progressed my glands stayed swollen but I started to get sick every 2 months or so and I am suffering from extreme fatigue, since the onset of the heart arrhythmia in January 

I had a lymph node biopsy done but it was inconclusive. I have also done multiple blood tests for glandular fever and they were all negative 

Any advice on what could be the issue or what to do next would be greatly appreciated"

22, male, 6'3, 210 lbs, sweden

&#x200B;

For the past months I've been dealing with left sided chest pains. This year alone I have gotten 4 ECG's and 4 stethoscope listenings and 1 major blood work done by 4 different doctors. The ECG's always came back normal and When i ask for a stress-test or an echo they always say i dont need one, my heart is fine they say. But still, I keep getting these chest pains and the more i think about it i can start feeling it in my left arm. 

I also want to add i suffer from health anxiety and thats why i have 4 ECGS done this year. I have poor posture due to being overweight (Ive lost 70 lbs). I dont know whats wrong with me. Is it a heart problem? Do i have a heart disease? Do i trust my docs? I want more tests but they dont want to give me any."
553,Getting overheated when standing/moving (minimal effort) until I vomit? 28F,"Hey all - I made a post not too long ago that details basically all of my medical history (it’s long) - I’m going to list what I think is relevant in this post, so feel free to check the last one for more details

A couple weeks ago my rheumatologist diagnosed me with ehlers-Danlos (leaning toward type 2 but need to see test results to determine which type)

28F

Medications:
Prozac //
Adderall XR and short acting //
Birth control (Junel)

Surgeries:
Chiari decompression brain surgery (2007) //
Appendectomy (2012) //
Gall bladder removed (2015)

My general heart rate is usually around 100 - 110 bpm, myself and my doctors have always just attributed it to the Adderall - I have had like a echocardiogram a few years ago that was normal, but I haven’t had it checked since

I have also been diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension and neurally mediated hypotension (I think that’s the right terminology?) but my blood pressure when sitting is usually normal

So here’s what’s been happening, when I stand up and move around for too long (taking the dogs out or walking to my car or doing chores, low effort stuff) I get super overheated like a hot flash or something and it makes me throw up (I get nausea pretty frequently from migraines, etc, but I almost never throw up then). I sweat like crazy, like my hair is soaked around my face and going back. It literally drips off of me like I’m living a Gatorade commercial. 
I get lightheaded and sometimes disoriented. Pretty sure if I ever try to keep standing after I vomit I would faint.

I haven’t been able to check my heart rate when it happens, but it kind of feels like my heart rate gets too fast like maybe POTS or something similar, idk

Also I just got fired due to immense amounts of bullshit and lost my health insurance so I am not sure when I’ll be able to go back to the doc yet. I’m not totally sure what type of doc I would need to see anyway.  

That’s pretty much it - any help is more than appreciated! Thanks so much!

I went to the er 4 days ago for chest pain/tightness, they did a bunch of tests and said I was fine and it was just anxiety. Today I’ve been sweating excessively. The pain hasn’t come back but my heart is racing although that could also be anxiety. I’m worried the sweating means I’m having a heart attack right now. Is that possible given my clean bill of health on Wednesday?"

556,"Almost a month of constant episodes of intense tingling/tenseness in a small area just below my shoulder blade. Do I need to see a doctor, or should I wait? What type of doctor should I see, and how much longer should I wait? (25M)","It's a strange sensation, and it's hard to describe. It's on the right side of my back right by my spine, about 2-3 inches below my shoulder blade. It's happening about 50% of the time. The intensity can vary. Sometimes it feels like ""tv static"", and other times it feels as if fabric is rubbing against my back. Sometimes I even have to pull my shirt away to see if it was just my shirt - it's usually not.

&#x200B;

When I first noticed it: It was a thing for a few days leading up to the ""big episode"". During the worst point (3 weeks ago), it felt as if that muscle had fallen asleep (that dull feeling you get prior to oxygenated blood re-entering it). It tingled so bad that it felt as if someone had a garden hose blasting right at that spot, and it continued feeling numb/dull and tingly for hours that night.

&#x200B;

There's also a very slight tensing going on. Almost as if there is a very small charlie horse. Sometimes, but not always.

&#x200B;

As for what ""activates"" it, it's hard to say. It seems random, but I know for certain that standing and bending down activates it. Using my right arm also seems to get it started. Laying flat on my back for a while calms it down. It also seems that doing my daily routine of push ups aggravates it, so I've had to stop doing those.

&#x200B;

There is NO PAIN thus far. It's just VERY distracting. I cannot seem to find a way to sit that doesn't make it constantly tingle. I've tried leaning back and looking up, sitting straight with no back rest, laying on my back... nothing makes it better. I'm worried it can be injured to become something catastrophic. I've been taking it easy and missing out on pretty much everything.

No existing medical issues, no medications, no drinking, drugs, or smoking whatsoever. My only imperfection is I have less than perfect posture and sit in a chair quite often.

I don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life. I am scared, and it's feeling like this is permanent."
557,35M Achy ears and ringing ears after supergluing headphone tips,"Prior to the incident I would have pain in my right ear when using headphones for extended periods (September, 2019), as well as when there was excessive Bass (I'm a DJ, February, 2019). I had accident when I was 15/16 where I didn't throw a firecracker away in time and it exploded near my head which gave me tinnitus in in that ear, but a very manageable amount.

Monday the 22nd I superglued the silicone tips on some earbuds. Waited approx. 4 hours for it to dry. After using the headphones for probably 30min. to an hour, I noticed aching in my left ear (roughly 10:30pm). Took 2 ibuprofen (400mg) and went to bed around Midnight. Woke up at 2am and had the ringing in my ears. Could the ""fumes"" from the cyanoacrylate glue cause my symptoms?

I've had the ringing for the past two weeks, and about 3 days ago took some over the counter tinnitus supplement. Ears have been a bit more achy since then. My Audiogram last week came back as ""no hearing loss"" which I'm so thankful for, but I'd still really like to know what is going on!

Diabetic (metformin, Linagliptin) 
My mother was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, and had a biliary derivation to remove part of the tumor, after her surgery she had a central caterer inserted and was given parenteral nutrition  for about 3 days, after that she started to try to eat, witch was very challenging to do due to nausea, at this point doctors started to give her Ondansetron, it worked somewhat, she can eat but not a lot, a month after her surgery she still has a lot of issues with nausea and we are using a medicine called Clodaset (Metoclopramida 10 MG Clorhidrato de ondansetrón 4 MG) , but now I’m reading that ondansetron  works by blocking serotonin receptors, could this cause depression?

19, F, 5'4"", about 150 lbs, white

Current medications: birth control (Cryselle), and oxybutynin for nervous bladder

Basic medical history: I'm very prone to sinus infections, and I had a root canal operation back in April of 2019 due to a malformed upper left molar (basically, it didn't fuse properly so I had an exposed nerve that eventually started dying after getting it filled in 2012. Not fun), I also still have my wisdom teeth

First post here, so bear with me. I started experiencing pain and pressure in my upper back teeth and jaw about a week ago, and today I woke up with a low grade fever that's been fluctuating from around 99.5F to 100.5F. I feel like this might be a sinus issue and not wisdom teeth for two reasons:

1. I am super prone to sinus infections for some reason.

2. I had a recent dental visit in June or July of this year, and my wisdom teeth were so far up in my head that my dentist wasn't even sure if they were going to come in at all.

However, I'm not super sure if its a sinus infection, because I've never had these symptoms before. My usual symptoms are a day of having a really sore throat, followed by up to a month of heavy sinus drainage with no fever. I almost always have to get an antibiotic because my body just won't fight it off for some reason, which is why the fever is sort of throwing me off. Any advice is appreciated. Also, if this is more a question for a dentist, I apologise and will take this post to a more appropriate sub. Thanks!"

For the past 2 months I've been having unusual problems pooping. It feels hard (in terms of work), not much comes comes out, it looks light brown and soft. I cant figure out why this started now, I've tried to googling a bit for this and among the usual problems listed:

* My diet has not changed in the past year, I cook myself, I do get some vegetables and fruits almost every day. I rarely consume sugary food or any type of fast food. Do not smoke or drink.
* About a year and half ago I've taken up running and I'm in the best physical shape of my life now. 
* I go to the toilet to poop at least once a day (every morning at the same time), though recently not every time anything comes out at all. Even though recently I've been spending way longer trying, at least 20-30 minutes.
* I've not really experienced any pain or discomfort related to this (other than worrying that something is wrong with me). Except for this week and last week I had to cut my run short because I felt sudden urge to poop (even though both times I really tried going just before starting the run). What came out after was mostly in liquid form.

I've tried to take laxatives twice a few weeks ago, first time nothing happened, second time quite a bit came out, mostly in liquid form, which was to be expected according to the description on the package.

I've also bought fiber supplements which I was taking regularly for about a week, but didn't experience any change.

It can also feel like I’m about to fall forward or backward while sitting in my chair. This always freaks me out and makes my very dizzy. A colleague of mine experienced it too a couple of times. This makes me think that it’s probably not me but the dizziness is due to sitting in the same position for a long period. And somehow the body gets confused if i rapidly change positions like standing up? Is this plausible or could there be something else? If not, professional advice would be greatly appreciated.

My only pre-existing medical issues are PCOS, asthma, OCD and Bipolar.  I have had migraines in the past but only once or twice per year, they're not a persistent issue for me.

Last night, I had what they think was a severe migraine aura so I was given an IV of Reglan and Benadryl. Within BARELY one minute of being given the IV, I was totally losing my shit, twitching and tremors all over my body and felt like my throat was burning and closing up, it was awful and came out of nowhere. It was like a panic attack in overdrive, featuring seizing and twitching all over my body.  They had to give me Ativan (which I've also never taken before), it helped a little but the problem still lasted for about two hours. This was the first time I've ever been given Reglan but they did inform me that ""this sometimes happens"".

It's been around 15 hours since I was given the IV and I still feel... really fucked up to be honest? Like major brain fog, and dizzy (like, trouble walking dizzy - I actually bumped my head on the table earlier while bending down to get something off the floor because I'm so uncoordinated) and panic-y. Is it common to still feel messed up this long after an IV of Reglan?  I'm considering making a doctor's appointment tomorrow because I'm honestly a bit scared by how out of it I feel."

Fast forwards weeks and my GP called me to tell me he will send me for an MRI as well. I wish I could remember the correct terminology he used but it was along the lines of checking out ""a couple of things"" , although the ultrasound to him also ""looks like a lipoma."" 

I'm just wondering what exactly a lipoma close to the bone means? Does a lipoma and, say, something more worrisome look different on ultrasound? I'm just trying to get to the bottom of why I'm being sent for more scans, it feels like they aren't 100% happy with my results.

Every time I go to see a GP, I'm told that it's just anxiety, and every time I talk to my psychiatrist about it he tells me that it isn't and I need to see a doctor about it. At this point they're just playing hot potato with me, and nobody is giving me any answers. I'm at a complete loss for what the problem might be or what to do, any advice is greatly appreciated!"
573,Groin Ache/Testicular Tingling Persisting for 3 Weeks,"24M, 6' 170lb caucasian

I will be seeing a Dr. about this this week but wanted to get an initial impression.

**Primary complaint and symptoms:**

\- Dull Ache in groin for 3 weeks with an occasional stinging/jabbing pain on either side of the groin, usually starting on either side of the perineum or scrotum and shooting down side of leg. The stinging sensation occurred initially when I began to first notice the issue but does not occur very much now, if at all. While I do feel a generalized ache around the entire groin, it is most apparent in the left side around the inner leg where the thigh and hip/groin meet. I feel it more when I sit up straight in a chair, less when i lean back in a chair, and least when I am standing and walking around. When there is not an ache or I am in a position where it is lessened, there is often a tingling in the perineum or scrotum (cannot explicitly identify location).

\-I have inspected my testes and found no lumps. The left is larger than the right by a solid margin, but while I do know the left is generally larger, I don't know if the size is unusual compared to normal.

\- I have more recently began to feel bloated in my lower abdomen, though I wouldn't describe it as aching.

\- I have been feeling generally tired/fatigued. Walking to classes in the morning leaves me feeling fairly tired and short of breath. This started this week, 2 weeks after symptoms manifested. However, I'm not sure if this is related to this issue or the ones I discuss down below.

**Additional medical information:**

\- I was sexually inactive for nearly 1.5 months before symptoms began.

\-I have GERD, and take 40mg Omeprazole daily to control it. GERD seems to be well controlled, I'm not burping and do not feel any burning or pain.

\- I have recently had more severe issues with my allergies, which have manifested as allergic asthma flareup (I had never had asthma prior to this year) and have been getting treatment for that since August. One week prior to the aching I completed a 4-3-2-1 regimen of Prednisone. The week of had began a 6-5-4-3-2-1 regimen. I took another 4-3-2-1 (10mg) regimen the week after. I have been off of large prednisone regimens for 2 weeks but did take 60 mg for a day due to allergy shots (required). I am also on Symbicort controller medication via inhaler and take albuterol as needed. 

I do think that Prednisone makes me somewhat more sensitive to hypertensive characteristics. My blood pressure normally alright, but while on it I have had a few registers of high BP I was 153/90 on the visit for sinus infection. There was a very stressful life event going on for me at that time - BP has since gone down and BPM has normalized as well.

\- Antibiotics: I have been on antibiotics off and on for various reasons since August. First for a wisdom tooth infection which needed a round of Amoxicyllin and Clindomycin to clear the infection pre operation (ending late September) and after removal of all four teeth, and then Doxicycline for a sinus infection (ending last week)."
574,"Back pain, pinched nerve, mysterious allergy, and numbness.","33F, 5'4"", ~135 lbs, US Florida, white

Typical meds: hormonal birth control, generic for seasonique

New meds (will detail when taken in timeline): 800mg IB, Hydrocodone Acetamin 5-325, muscle relaxers (not sure which one exactly), prednisone, Naproxen, Benadryl

Smoke a pack a day for the last ~15 years, drink alcohol occasionally (maybe 2-3 drinks month)


Essentially I had some back pain earlier this year which turned into what I believe is a pinched nerve. Sprinkle in a mysterious allergy, and now my legs are numb.


Feb 2019: started to feel some unusual back pain but I had been falling asleep in odd places like sitting at my desk doing homework so I chalked it up to that.


March 2019: spent 6 hrs in the car one day driving between my city and the city where my grandfather passed, I was also cleaning out his house at this time. Once I got home that evening my back pain was excruciating so I scheduled an appointment with my GP for a few days later. I also began to have muscle spasms in my lower back.


GP apt in March: Dr said he could feel muscle spasms and prescribed me some relaxers, 800mg IB, and Prednisone. I took the relaxers in the evening only as I still had to work and drive but took the Prednisone and IB as prescribed.


Late March/Early April 2019: began to have uncontrollable itchiness on my palms and the bottom of my feet. I had no visible rash or bumps. Went back to GP and he said it could have been the Prednisone but as I had already completed the course he said it would go away and advised me to take Benadryl. At this point going forward I began to obsessively check my dogs, and home (and bed) for bugs like bedbugs or fleas that could be causing this and have found nothing.


April-May 2019: no change in back pain or spasms, Dr upped the mg on my relaxers and I continued to take them in the evening only. Dr sent me for an Xray at the end of May. Xray results suggest early arthritis in my L1 & L2. After the Xray the Dr suggested I try PT for my back issues. Dr also prescribed me the hydrocodone at this time, he gave me 12 pills and I have only now (Oct) finished them so I was not taking these often at all. Still no change in the itchiness other than it getting worse and spreading to my whole body. I had not changed anything that I use (soaps, cleaners, etc.) but I still attempted to work through everything that came in contact with my skin to test for the allergy. No change or relief. 


At this point in time I was part of a mass layoff at work and so lost my health insurance.


June-August 2019: decided to wait to find a new job to let my back heal. Pain was getting better, and spasms were almost completely gone. Since I had no insurance I did not do PT, instead using stretching exercises I found online as a substitute. Itch still was there and slowly getting worse.  Over this time I also experimented with taking naproxen instead of the IB in case that was causing my itch. I had taken the 800mg IB in the past for cramps so I didn't expect it to be that but I tried. Does not appear to be the IB because I had the same issues when taking the naproxen.


August 2019: a hurricane was coming so we had a lot of prep work to do outside, I overexerted myself moving patio furniture and felt pain and some spams in my back again. Due to this I was walking odd and 'babying' my lower back.


September 2019: woke up one morning unable to move my left leg without sending why felt like a lightening bolt through that side of my body. Until now most of my back pain was on the right side. Without insurance I attempted to call my GP and they said I would just be referred to PT even with the new symptoms so I did not go into the office.


Late September 2019: walking was so painful that I purchased a cane and scheduled an appointment with a chiropractor. Chiropractor said my hip pain sounded like a pinched nerve. Itch still occuring and is at its worst, I am now scratching so hard in my sleep that I am breaking the skin on my legs and arms.


October 2019: after a few weeks of chiropractor appointments I am feeling better but still walking with the cane. At the chiropractor's suggestion I purchase a tens machine and at home alternate between heat, cold, and tens each day. Chiropractor suggests that I get an MRI. 



Mid month I come down with an upper respiratory infection so I stopped going to the chiropractor so I don't spread my illness. This month I did go to a Dr who specializes in medical marijuana because my mother (suffers from fibromyalgia) suggested a thc cream that she uses. I am at this point in time still waiting on my license so I have not yet tried any medical marijuana products. The same Dr gave me antibiotics for my illness and another round of Prednisone.


This past Friday Nov 1 2019: woke up and could tell something was weird about my hip. Bending, sitting with weight on that hip and actions like coughing now make a pins and needles feeling shoot through my whole lower body, both legs from my hips to my feet. This morning I can tell that my legs are slightly numb even when I don't have the pins and needles feeling.


At this point I am at the end of my mental rope. Between the pain and itchiness I feel as if I'm loosing it. I plan to go back to the chiropractor next week as my upper respiratory infection is gone. The chiropractor has suggested several times now that I get an MRI which I am considering even though the cost is a lot without insurance. 


Do you think this is the correct route? I will take any advice or suggestions, at this point I am desperate and would try anything."

Burn at day 3.5 after accident: [https://i.imgur.com/dpESQB9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dpESQB9.jpg)

Burn at day 4.5 after accident...

Before cleaning: [https://i.imgur.com/NJA09Y3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NJA09Y3.jpg)

After cleaning: [https://i.imgur.com/j6CEMc3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/j6CEMc3.jpg)

While we were traveling in Vietnam, my girlfriend (described above) had the inside of her right knee joint come in contact with some part of a motorcycle (exhaust or engine case) and got burned. Don't have an initial picture, but it looked worse than a first degree burn, and she could feel it, so we assumed second degree burn. For various reasons, didn't go to a hospital that day or the next, and then flew back to the US.

Immediately after the accident, rinsed it with cool water and cleaned it with some rubbing alcohol. After arriving back at our accommodation 8+ hours later, we went to a pharmacy and got saline solution, iodine, silver sulfadiazine, and gauze/tape. For the first 3 days, she was cleaning it with the saline solution and then iodine, and then applying the silver sulfadiazine and covering with gauze/tape. Yesterday just cleaned with saline and applied the silver sulfadiazine and left uncovered. Then just applied silver sulfadiazine. Have also been taking paracetamol/ibuprofen every 4-5 hours for pain.

Posted a picture of what it looked like yesterday (day 3.5), and then two pictures from today (day 4.5). Yesterday, she noticed it starting to scab. Throughout today is slowly started getting to the point of the 'before cleaning' picture. She then used saline solution to clean it and it sounds like the top layer came off very easily and now looks like the 'after cleaning' picture.

I've heard second degree burns are supposed to blister and not scab. Is this an issue, or can this just sometimes happen?

We still have not gone to the hospital as we've heard that they usually just prescribe silver sulfadiazine, which we got plenty of while we were still in Vietnam. Also, we were traveling long-term in Asia, so we still need to get our US medical insurance back up and running... Don't want to go to the hospital before that.

Any information would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

578,Dog scratched my arm,"Hi people, it's kinda silly but i'm a bit uneasy so i'm gonna ask anyway.

Im male 6'4 280lbs 27 years old.

Today went to a friends house which has a dog, the doggie is a golden and i started playing with and the doggy started jumping to my chest in a friendly play, since im relatively tall the doggy used it's paws to try to climb on me and in the process scratched my arms a little bit with it's nails. The dog had a rabies and tetanus vaccine at the start of the year. It was playful the whole time and the scratches were not intentful in any way. Also the dog is walked outside regulary but is getting some cleaning when it comes to the house.

The scratches itself are pretty insignifican't no blood as far as i've seen.They were red for a while but now are barely visible. First thing i did was wash with soup, and later like an hour later cleaned with medical alcohol.

Here are two pictures: https://imgur.com/a/MkuvkU8

Should i be worried about that and get some kind of vaccine or something?


Edit:Also should i say i fell extremely slight pain/irritation on my arms. Should also mention that the owner said she was scratched a couple of times also - long before and nothing happened"
579,I [21F] excessively have to pee after pooping.,"I’m asking here because I’m not sure if this is serious enough to warrant asking a doctor, and I also can’t really find anything online about this.

I’m white, 169cm tall, weigh around 47kg, don’t smoke or do any drugs besides prescribed ritalin and birth control. I don’t have any physical medical issues, but I have had some struggles with gaining weight, and I thought I had IBS but it seems more likely to be a gluten sensitivity (not allergy or intolerance). 

So basically, every time I poop, which is usually once, sometimes twice, a day, I have to pee a LOT afterwards. Like, I’ll be pooping for say, 2-3 minutes, then I can sit on the toilet for up to 40 minutes afterwards forcing out pee. It doesn’t all come out at once, but it feels like I have to pee and I can “squeeze” out a small amount at a time. And if I don’t sit and force out as much as I can for at least 20 minutes, I’ll have to pee really badly again after around 10 minutes, and then visit the toilet every 10 minutes for about an hour after I poop. And even if I force out a lot of pee right after I poop, I sometimes will have to pee again after 10-20 minutes. 

It doesn’t happen every single time I poop, but almost, and it has been going on for quite awhile. Several months. 

Curious if anyone here might know what’s causing this and if it’s something I should be worried about."

They happen pretty much everywhere throughout my body. Sometimes muscles in my face, particularly the corner of my mouth will feel tight. Almost like a slight pulling sensation. Additionally I've been dealing with some other issues that might be related. When I'm napping, sometimes my mind will ""freeze"" for a few seconds and wake me up. Meaning that my train of thought just stops for a few moments. Also dealing with quite a bit of buzzing in my head, dizziness, and other strange sensations that I find difficult to put into words.  The ground sometimes feels like its bouncing when I walk, like I'm walking on a trampoline. Or my hands will sometimes feel foreign to me. I sometimes feel like I'm on the verge of passing out that comes on randomly. Also getting quite a bit of heart palpitations, feeling like a fluttering in my chest. Fast and forceful heartbeat after eating accompanied by palpitations. Hard to workout due to heart rate unless I'm on propranolol. Im quite concerned but I'm never lucky enough to get a twitch at the doctors office and everything else ends up getting attributed to anxiety. 

I've had a brain MRI a year ago which came back clean, an Holter which came back with minor twave abnormalities and rare supraventricular ectopies. Heart MRI that came back mostly clean, but mildly reduced right ventricular ejection fraction at 39%. Possibly due to my lung disease, but that is now resolving due to smoking cessation.

Weight: 85kg

Race: caucasian

Duration of complaint: 5 days

Location; Aus

Any existing relevant medical issues; vulvodynia

Current medications; Implanon, fluoxetine, amytriptaline.

I had a colpsosopy with two biopsies taken on Thursday. This is due to bleeding (very very minorly) after sex, my last smear was normal.

On Friday night, I've had the worse cramps I've ever had since getting my period. It honestly felt like my body was trying to expel my uterus through my vagina.

I'm still bleeding. I've read not to worry unless it doesn't stop after 7 days but I'm still worried.

I've had Implanon for just over 3 years (changed in Feb). The periods I have been getting were 4-5 months apart, very light, and lasting only 3 days. My last period was in August. Same as usual, very light and 3 days. Almost no cramping. My boobs are also sore for about two weeks before I start bleeding. They weren't sore this time and I had no indication that my period was coming.

I'm not really cramping anymore, but I get little 'tiwnges' now and then but they're not painful. Now the bleeding isn't what you would call heavy, but it is definitely heavier than the periods I have been getting.

So, my question is. When should I worry about this bleeding? Should I wait and see if I'm still bleeding on Friday and call my GP then or should I go in tomorrow?"

I also had my period twice after, but I'm just wondering if it's ever possible to get pregnant with no symptoms and heavy menstruation? I heard that some people still got pregnant after similar situation and also some website claiming it's possible. Also some people claiming around that they got pregnant but they never knew about it until the baby was born. Would it be better to take another pregnancy test to be sure?"

25F, 125lbs, 5’8, white, no prior medical conditions, medications, drugs/smoking, and otherwise healthy. This is been going on for about a year and a half and I can’t pinpoint the cause.

So it all started with a headache, muscle soreness and excessive twitching, and nerve pain/tingling/burning, all weirdly on the left side of my body. My head hurts mostly on the left side and I keep getting these tingling and pressure sensations in my face, almost as though water is trickling down that side. Also my left ear keeps ringing. It all seemed to come out of nowhere.

My left arm and leg are tingly and burn as well. It feels as though a bunch of bugs are crawling all over them...which is disturbing to say the least. It’s worse in my leg, and it’ll often go numb quickly if I’m in certain positions. It makes it difficult to exercise because my leg often feels weak, so I’ve quit all exercise aside from walking. 

The last 2 months or so my headache has become awful and has persisted everyday. My vision goes blurry a lot and I keep seeing these black dots in my vision. This symptom is new. 

I have no idea if these symptoms are linked in any way, I just find it strange that it’s only my left side that’s affected. I thought maybe it’s a pinched nerve, or perhaps posture problems, since I’ve developed pretty bad soreness in my left shoulder and hip. The left sided headache and the duration of all this despite trying to correct my posture and laying down flat as much as possible is what stumps me. 

I’ve been treated for a possible sinus/ear infection already to no avail. Should I push for a referral to a physiotherapist, or maybe a neurologist? My doctor doesn’t seem concerned. Any advice would be appreciated, i’m starting to get freaked out."

My first year of college was very difficult. For one thing, I had a problem eating. I thought I was going to choke all the time and had trouble swallowing. Odd because I was slightly overweight. I would chew small bites of food and struggle to swallow.  I eventually only ate certain foods. Only occasional meat if I remember correctly. Seemed like I got over this completely when I was maybe 23 or 24. 

The other odd thing is I noticed these lumps all around my scalp. It seemed like I’d get a few lumps and my hair would recede. It wasn’t all at once but I just kept seeing bumps about the size of a quarter. 

The last thing was my head changed shape. The upper area of my head got noticeably wider. Even today I can see the areas that grew on each side. What this does is make hair on the sides of my head look recessed and thin. 

Hair loss has always been a huge part of my life. I’m nearly 50 now and still would give anything to have it back. I just wondered if it was just male pattern baldness or something else."

Medical issues: Loss of lumbar and cervical lordosis, generalised anxiety disorder

Hello, 

So these past few months have been very stressful, I've been having severe health anxiety which started out thinking I have something in my brain, then it was my pancreas, then it was my moles and so on....

I'm becoming increasingly worried about my heart recently as I'm getting extra heartbeats, they're strong and happen just once then vanish. Sometimes they go away for days then come back. Also some chest pain/pressure but that could be due to my muscle tension. I have already been to the ER twice where they did blood tests, multiple chest xrays, and two ECGs. The doctor in the ER checked the pulse in my foot and used a stethoscope (I think that's what they're called) on my chest. Was told that absolutely nothing was wrong, even tested my thyroid which was fine. 

I'm actually getting more emotional each day and don't know how much longer I can take, yes I'm already seeing someone and taking antidepressants but it's really tough, I keep thinking I have some undiagnosed heart issue that won't be figured until it's too late. 

If you read this, I'd appreciate any help."

I work out a lot, i’m skinny, i sleep enough, don’t smoke, or anything like that that could effect my testosterone levels. I also have had slower facial hair development for the past 2 years. What can i do to fix it? should i go to a real doctor? ANY information will help. Thanks so much!"

My hands have been shaking for a few years now, and i want to know what could cause it at 17 years old, sometimes my hands shake more but after 10-15 minutes they go back to shaking as usual, i would also like to know what i could do about it and what kind of doctor should i visit.

I'm also pretty sure I have social anxiety (not diagnosed by a professional), and my hands do shake worse during social situations, but sometimes they shake badly even when I'm at home, and not feeling anxious. But again my hands are shaking a little all the time, no matter what I do or where I am.

Duration of pain: overnight
Health issues: IBS, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Acid Reflux Disease 
Day 14 of menstrual cycle 

Hey docs, I'm currently worried that I might have appendicitis. I'm currently having some lower right hand stomach pain and pain around belly button. The pain is very crampy, but slightly sharper when walking around. It feels better when lying down. I don't have a fever, no chills or anything like that. I'm very gassy and can't stop passing gas. The past two days I've been pooping more than usual, with occasional diarrhea mixed in. I tried ""the jump test"" that one doctor told me to do a few years ago. I jumped and it didn't really hurt any more than usual. I can press on the area and it doesn't make it worse."

When this happens my limbs feel pretty weird as well and i get light headed. My head just goes full on panic mode and i have to sit down and breathe, and it slowly goes away. Are these panic attacks or is there something more to it? It usually last for about a minute. Also i’m kinda busy with school and work and havent been sleeping too good lately."
603,Big Toe Pain,"My left big toe has been painful to the touch for the last month.  Specifically, where the top right edge of the toenail meets the skin.  The pain is sporadic, not constant.  And the pain only comes from contact, like socks or shoe.  But when I am in pain it is so sensitive that even a bed sheet touching it triggers the pain.  There is no discoloration of my toe or any other obvious sign that something is wrong.

Only thing I can think of that preceded the pain is a pedicure.  The pedicurist was a bit rough and drew blood when scraping where the nail meets the toebed.  But she was rough on both big toes, and its only my left that's in pain.  Also, I am not entirely certain of the sequence of events: this was four weeks ago, and I may have had slight pain before that, I just don't remember.  Immediately after the pedicure went on a big trip with lots of walking and I definitely noticed the pain then.

My details: 34F, 5'7"", 118lb.  I don't drink/smoke/do drugs.  Only current medical issues are chronic headaches (taking propanolol) and acid reflux (pantoprazole)

606,Memory issues ranging from the same day to the past week and beyond,"Hello!

Male, 31, White, UK, smoker, non drug user.

Drink alcohol daily, get around 5-6 hours sleep every night, sometimes less.

Over the past few years I've noticed I really struggle to recall events. I often can't remember what I did a month ago on a family holiday, or the past week at work (last Friday I had a meeting and had no real recollection of what I'd done that week aside from a few key points) to issues remembering what I did this morning. 

It's concerning me as it's obviously bad, but I also worry it's stunting my personal development as I can't learn new stuff, since I seem to forget, unless I do it constantly. Also my emotional development as i cant grow as a person if I have no memories to recall or learn from. 

Some days I wake up and have a weird disassociation that I'm going to work and it feels like a first day, when I remember it's not. Like I remember the office, The people, but it feels like my past memories of being there are vague and aren't real, as though it hasn't really happened, yet I know it has. 

I don't know what to do about this, I'm sure any doctor will dismiss it as I'm not totally forgetting stuff, just things that aren't interesting, I guess. Which makes sense, maybe? You can't remember every boring moment of your life, can you.

Honestly I don't know what to do and if this is normal or if I'm just overthinking it and trying to remember more than a normal person should remember. 

I'm expecting people tell me to go to a doctor,  which I guess I will, but thought I'd ask here first to see if anyone had some advice or outside perspective to give me.

Thanks in advance."

I've been having some pain in one of my nostrils. Pain similar to high pressure. Went to ent doctor, had a look in my nostrils with his tool and just gave me  a nasal spray (contains cortisone). he said ""very slight allergy"".

no improvement so far, 3 weeks later after using it twice a day (as well as a saline spray).

i had a car accident years ago, my face slammed on the back seat. My lip was affected, but i didn't get my nose checked.

What could be the issue?

specific location: upper side of nose, between nose bridge and nostril.

septum doesn't seem deviated, i can breathe well through both nostrils, and i only breathe from my mouth at night (without snoring), or whenever i am laying down on bed (i can't breathe through my nose properly, if i do, i feel like suffocation)

thank you kindly"
610,The ringing in my ears is deafening,"Female, age 18


Drugs: Used to smoke cannabis and accidentally smoked k2 a few times, before I found out what it was, about a month ago. Once our weed was laced with cocaine, on the day I passed it up, but I never had a good high experience, it was always scary, heart racing, nausea, my thoughts were literally loud, to the point where I couldn’t hear because I kept thinking. I was shaking really bad every time. So I’m not sure if the weed was laced the whole time or I just smoked too much.


Smoker: I recently started smoking cigarettes, about two weeks ago, because I was in a house where people smoked inside all the time. I stayed there for a little more than a month. Got kicked out with my boyfriend, and started having horrible migraines, and apparently got really moody. So I stole a cigarette from him and smoked it, all better. Don’t worry I’m trying to quit already, only 2 or 3 per day, sometimes less. At first I smoked whenever he smoked, 8 times a day at least.


No medications except cranberry tablets, cause I have an infection.


Height: 5”4 if I remember right.


Weight: 97lbs


I think I’ve covered all the necessary background info, now to the reason for the title. 


So I’m pretty sure I’m anemic but I don’t have a doctor yet and I wanted some outside opinions at least. I have random bruises show up all the time on my legs especially. That was the first sign lol. I like to sit in the shower, and when I stand up, I get really heavy, then my sinuses clear and this deafening ringing starts up in my ears, it’s so loud it’s almost pulsating. So loud I can’t hear anything real clearly. Everything feels muffled. And I get sparkles in my vision, then tunnel vision. So I stand there until I stop feeling weak, and the ringing starts to subside, which takes a few minutes. Then I just hear this static sound, like sand I guess. That sound lasts maybe 5 or 10 minutes, never really counted.


This still happens when I stand up from a chair, or couch, or really anything. It’s not always that bad, unless I was in the shower. It’s always that bad after the shower. I’m recovering rn, it’s been at least 10 minutes and the sand sound is still pretty loud, and I’m shaky but everything else is over.

I’m scared that one day I’ll pass out, a few times I’ve fallen over after getting up and walking away from a couch, it always takes a sec to kick in. Fell right on the floor, and then just laid there cause I was too weak to stand up. Anyway is this anemia do you think, or something more serious? Been happening for at least 2 years, didn’t use to be this bad.


Also, proud of myself I woke up at 8am today, and it’s 1:49pm now, haven’t smoked yet"

Was bench pressing a few months ago. Felt something in the front of my left shoulder pull a little. Had to take around two months off due to anterior shoulder/pec minor pain during any movements where my arm was raised up or chest pressing movements.


It's now been 5 months since the injury. I've been back in the gym for the past 3 months. Still my arm/pec in the area in the picture cramps when I put my arm across my body or hug something. It's the last symptom that just will not get better. I wake up at night when I'm laying on my left side because it cramps up. 




Any ideas of what it could be? I can't afford a follow up PCP visit for a referral to a PT atm.


Additional info:

- Was using the ""[iso lateral wide chest machine](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/olNQWjEVpNQ/maxresdefault.jpg)"" when I got the injury. Where you sit, grab two handles and push forward/inwards across your chest. 

- I also believe I had overstretched on dumbbell flat bench that day."

613,Is it uncommon to have wisdom teeth removed without sedation?,"28,male,6'0, 170 pounds, no previous medical issues.

I'm going to have 4 wisdom teeth removed, all impacted and not flared up.

The dentist wanted to discuss sedation options and I was like ""What sedation? Isn't it the regular local anesthesia?"". He was surprised I wanted no sedation because that's what his patients usually do, with either IV sedation or gas. 

He asked if I was absolutely sure about it because the whole procedure for 4 impacted teeth can be quite aggressive. He said I could at least take a small Valium pill beforehand.

Do you think any of this is necessary?"
614,Chronically ill and dependent on narcissistic parents: I feel like suicide is the only way out of this.,"Female, 26, Europe, 5'4"", 85 lbs, iron deficiency anemia, celiac, gastritis, sicca syndrome, undiagnosed neuro issues Nexium 20mg - I never smoke, drink or use drugs

Here are the symptoms that have piled up these past few years:

&#x200B;

* Weight loss, despite eating 2000-2200 calories a day (since 2013)
* Alternating between severe constipation and greasy yellow diarrhea (since 2013)
* Gastritis/GERD (since 2016)
* Iron deficiency anemia (since 2017)
* Extreme dryness: eyes, nose, mouth/throat, skin, hair, and vagina (since 2017 - awaiting results for salivary gland biopsy)
* Neuro issues: diagnosed with upper motor neuro syndrome by 2 different neurologists, objective worsening weakness on left side of body, brisk reflexes on left side of body, balance issues (with Romberg sign), swallowing issues (can only eat mashed food), bladder/bowel incontinence OR retention, partial seizures, whole body goes limp when doing efforts etc
* Extreme tiredness, despite sleeping 12 hours a night, get « attacks » where I have an urgent need to sleep, and often times I have disorientation/dissociation when too tired/when waking up (can’t remember my own name, where the bathroom is located, what year we are in etc). Recently got MRIs and a spinal tap (no results yet). Been hospitalized in the neuro ward twice.

That is for most of my symptoms. I have to live with that on the daily, and I can’t stress enough how hard it is, physically and psychologically, to accept. Pooping myself at 26 is humiliating, it's not that I can't hold it, I just don't feel when I need to go, it goes out on its own. Not being able to swallow normal food is scary, I keep choking during meals. I used to go hike, can't do that anymore. I was a musician, can't play music anymore. Can't even read or watch movies for long before my eyes turn red from dryness (I often get keratitis, despite using artificial drops) etc

But the worst part is that I can’t take care of myself anymore, for obvious reasons. I can’t work, go grocery shopping or even open jars on my own. I can still shower by myself, and do basic things, like washing a few utensils, basic surface cleaning, etc but everything that requires strength or ""finer"" motion skills is impossible (can't peel veggies, as it turns into cutting myself or dropping them). So I have been back at living with my parents, and my parents have always been dramatic, narcissistic in nature. My father is impulsive, he is the kind of person who starts fight with all of the neighbors for absolutely nothing, he constantly feels attacked by people, he talks about conspiracy theories all day, and yells at people if they don’t agree with him. He had a phase where he was an alcoholic, and would beat me (when I was a teen). My mom is not exactly the same, she has always taken care of me, but she also had an odd behavior. Like, she will definitely cook for me, clean my bathroom, etc but then she’ll come around and tell me « You are worthless, I wish you hadn’t been born, you’re so disabled I can’t even have hobbies, all of this is because of you, you’re ruining my life », or if she finds me disoriented she will say things like « you’re completely insane, you should be a psychiatric institute, you’ll never do anything with your life anyway, nobody else but me would take care of you ». When my anemia was very severe and I had trouble breathing even at rest, I once texted her (at night) to call an ambulance because I was really out of breath and she came around yelling at me, about how I was faking it and should just go back to sleep, and she started hitting herself in front of me saying « if it wasn’t punished by the law, I’d hit you and probably kill you, that’s why I am hitting myself, just so I don’t hit you. See, your craziness is contagious! ».

Needless to say, I can’t live like this anymore. Not only are my symptoms too hard to deal with, but I can’t stand living with my parents. I am just sitting here, waiting for my test results, and I have NO treatment for now. I think I may be falling into depression because everything is just too hard. What can I do?? I have no money to pay someone to help me.

EDIT: Since the post is locked, I just wanted to thank everyone for their help and advice, it means a lot to know total strangers still care. I'll be seeing a social worker ASAP, and discuss my options with them."

It usually sits between 130-140/ 80-90, before I was on medication. Last time I checked/ had it checked was a couple months ago , and about a month after starting my new medication. It was 125/85. However I get headaches quite a bit but it isn’t due to dehydration or caffeine OR migraines, as these all feel different. My headaches are at the base of my skull where my neck meets it, and when I bend down or move my head up and down it throbs worse and worse (not the same as my dehydration headaches which hurt way less and hurt the entire time) 

I don’t know if that’s anything serious.

622,I suspect I have an STI but I can’t figure out what. (23M/5’11/180),"Basically a week  ago I had unprotected sex twice a female I never met before. A few hours after the last session I began to feel the urge to urinate more frequently. I also felt like I couldn’t empty my bladder. It wasn’t very severe but it was definitely noticeable. So the next day about 36 hours later I went to the doctor and explained my symptoms,  which at the time was only frequent urination/urge to urinate. I told them I suspected an STI and I provided them with urine. Two days later it came back negative for chlamydia, gonorhea, and trich. It’s also worth noting this has been the only sex I had for basically a year and I definitely wouldn’t be surprised if this female didn’t tell me she had something.

However, since that time I’ve experienced more symptoms. There’s been an increasing sensation around my urethra specifically the tip of the penis that comes and goes. I wouldn’t describe it as burning or itching but more of an uncomfortable tingling if that makes sense. The past two days I’ve also noticed a slight redness  on the top of the tip of my penis, accompanied with extremely small bumps. It’s honestly so subtle if I wasn’t experiencing the other symptoms I wouldn’t think anything of it or even noticed it. Lastly there’s also been a very very small amount of clear sticky discharge, with no odor. It’s exactly like pre-cum but because it’s occurring without arousal and given the circumstances I’m sure it’s related.

I posted in r/STD and one user believes it may be Mycoplasma Genitalium? I certainly plan on going back to the doctor, but I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction until that time.

Last night I was walking on uneven ground when my right ankle rolled out really far and it popped kind of loudly. I didn’t like immediately collapse or anything, in fact I kept walking on it. It hurts pretty bad when I move it if I put my weight straight down and keep it still it’s fine, can support me. 

When I got home I put three socks on for compression and went to bed. When I woke up today there was like no pain to speak of until I got out and sort of tweaked it and it hurt again. 

Taking the socks off, there is still swelling and it is slightly purple, not too discolored though. 

I can move my foot up and down pretty easily but rolling it side to side is where I have some trouble.

I don’t know exactly what is helpful in this so if you have questions please ask so I can clarify!

Last night laying on my back my left leg and left arm went to sleep and conpletely numb. As I can recall I was not laying in a way that would potentially cause this. Today, both legs, both arms and my cheeks have a numb type feeling to them. Should I go in and see someone?"

626,I (22F) have gotten a cold/flue 10 times in the last year,"Hi,

I never used to get sick, except maybe some sniffling in december but in the last year I've gotten sick 8-10 times (also during the summer). I'm literally sneezing right now while trying to study for my exams. They mostly seem like colds (sneezing, clogged nose, slight headache), at least 2 times the flu and one lung infection for which I got antibiotics. 
There are two factors that changed before this started: last year I got asthma medication and I moved to a new appartment (maybe the air is too dry). 
Could any of this be the cause or is there something else that can cause getting a cold very often (or is it just bad luck)?

Analpram HC(started 10/2), stool softener(started yesterday)

I’ve been dealing with some blood on my toilet paper since July of this year. It would be periodic(2-3 days in a 2 week period.)Then around the end of September I started to see blood in the bowl and the tissue. Went back to my GI dr and she said I have a small anal tissue and a small hemorrhoid. She put me Analpram. Started using it 10/2/19. It seemed to work well. Had some blood on the tissue every so often but at some point it seemed to go away. After it went away for a few days I stopped using the Analpram. Well just yesterday I had a large and hard stool and had the most amount of blood on the tissue and in the bowl to date. Woke up this morning with pretty much the same amount of blood. Started using the Analpram again after each BM and before bed. 

I bought a 100mg Stool Softener to see if that would help. Just used it last night and I don’t think it took effect yet. I’m just worried that this won’t ever go away, which is irrational of course. 

But I just want to know if I should try anything different. Or if I need to seek potential surgery(which I want to avoid at all costs). 
I’ve also been taking Kefir a yogurt probiotic. I’ve been doing epsom salt baths as well, but will start to do those more frequently now. I also eat between 30-40mg of fiber each day. 

Any other suggestions? And at what point would surgery be on the table? 

Edit: I’m also physically active. Should I take a break from exercise for now? Or just keep going as long as the pain isn’t bad? 

I also want to avoid infection."

Pain in right rib

Okay so about a week and half ago I started experiencing a tigh cramping pain in my stomach, it got worse at night to the point where I was up crying and couldn’t sleep . I didn’t think much about it so I didn’t see a doctor then about 4 days ago it went to my lower right side and it was a sharp pain that concerned me so I went to the emerg they took all my blood work (everything came back normal) and they took an X-ray and the next day an ultrasound that was about 2-3 days ago and I haven’t gotten a call back yet. Anyways a day or so after that the sharp pain is now under my right rib .  It’s sharp all the time I can’t laugh , sneeze , breath hard etc. Without it hurting so bad i especially can’t lay certain ways either . I went to walk in to see if I could get pain killers because Advil does nothing and they gave me medication for gas (in case it was just gas built up) I took it yesterday and it still hasn’t done anything. I’m in so much pain I took all these tests still have no answers. I literally have noo symptoms at all except for the sharp pain under my rib cage on the right . By the way I’m a 20 yr old female . I did miss my birth control at the start of the month (no not pregnant got tests already) and all of the weird pains started after that ."

For over a year I have been getting intense physical anxiety, id say 90% of waking hours, varies in severity.

Feeling of shaking and intense irritability, muscle ridged feeling. When standing have to clench feet to ground so I don’t feel like I’m going to fall. Basically clench your fists and squeeze as hard as you can, it feels like this all the time. Symptoms don’t seem to be triggered situationally, no social anxiety. 

Mentally I feel great. No social anxiety what so ever.

Have had a number of medical tests to no avail, other then very high blood pressure, was prescribed linsnopril 5mg. When I took it the symptoms went 100% away, I was in disbelief. I have since stopped taking it due to it giving me mental anxiety/panic/ intrusive thoughts.  Symptoms all came back.

I have also taken Xanax once before a long flight. Symptoms instantly went away. 

I have since lowered my blood pressure with cardio. Still a little high but much better. 

Symptoms are pretty intense. Any thoughts?"

I've been taking Sudafed or Nyquil as needed, which typically helps but doesn't completely get rid of the nose problems. Typically exasperated by lying down or slouching while sitting.

But now I'm sick of it. The first appointment I could get with my doctor is in two weeks, so I thought posting here could help get me some insight. I looked at my nose yesterday and noticed it looks really swollen on the inside. Is this indicative of anything? Sorry for the really weird facial expression.

I initially think this is a UTI because I feel the need to pee more often, but the symptoms go away after a couple of days and they aren't very serious when I get them. Last time I got a UTI, I was peeing blood, shaking uncontrollably, and the urge to pee all the time was always super prominent. However, its not like that at all with this feeling. Its just a little irritation at the end of peeing, and a little while after I have a very slight feeling of needing to pee. This usually goes away but comes back after we have sex again, even if the sex is a week later. This is PIV sex and we always use a condom.

But recently I have had server muscle twitcing in my upper back (same muscle every time) for 2 weeks or so. That stopped after I took a run (no idea if related), but for 2 weeks or so, I have had other ""minor"" muscle twitches (still very visible), primarily in my right foot (same muscle every time) and sometimes in my left leg.

The doctor at the hospital talked about some long term complications as high potassium and/or low calcium - But my own doctor was not concerned, as my blood tests for normal when I was in the hospital.  


So he said I should just wait it out. It has been over 1 month now, since the twitching started. Should I ask to get blood work done again? And if so, what tests would you recommend?

Race White

Duration of complaint: 3 months

Location: Maryland, USA

Any existing relevant medical issues: Born with mild cerebral palsy (CP), chronic constipation for the last 3 years

Current medications: Gabapentin, amitriptyline (although ineffective for headache)

So about 3 months ago, I started having a burning sensation on the top and back of my head. It's constant, seems worse when I lie down, and doesn't go away. It doesn't radiate, but is in a line from a spot on the top of my head to the back. No nausea, sensitivity to light, or other symptoms. Pain is usually a 5/10, goes up to 7/10 when I lay down. Occasional trapezius muscle pain on the left side of my neck, and sometimes my neck ""clicks."" The pain makes it hard to sleep. Nothing I've tried so far seems to help, and nothing makes it worse or better. 

At this point, I've seen 3 neurologists, an infectious disease specialist,  and a headache specialist, and they're all stumped. I've had an MRI of my brain and cervical spine (with and w/out contrast), CT scan, MRV, EEG, blood tests, a scan of my carotid arteries, and an eye exam to check for increased ocular pressure, all of which have come back normal. 

The doctors have ruled out Lyme disease, occipital neuralgia, migraine, tension headache, cervicogenic headache, and epicrania fugax. 

I've tried ibuprofen, naproxen, heat, ice, a migraine cocktail in the ER, topical lidocaine, acupuncture, topamax, indomethacin, a Medrol dose pack, amitriptyline, and gabapentin, and nerve blocks to my occipital and supratrochlear nerves. Nothing has helped so far.

Does anyone know what this could be? Or anything else I could try that might help?"
637,Paradoxical effects from sedatives on workout performance and energy.,"33/M. 5’6, 130 Lbs.

This concerned my doctor but he simply brushed it off as “odd” and didn’t seem to delve into this any further.

About 3 years ago, I assumed I was simply getting older and was out of shape from working an office job... I’d run out of breath going up stairs, and doing any high intensity activity simply exhausted me after a few seconds and caused my heart rate to skyrocket instantly.

I have been single for 2 years and even stopped having sex for a long time because even the movements involved with sex cause me to run out of breath pretty quickly and need to stop and catch my breath (within 20-30 seconds). I simply don’t have the endurance to jog or do exercise as I did 10 years ago. My body simply “gives out”. I run out of air and lack the “umph” to perform exercise.

I was recently prescribed a sedative medication to sleep during a stressful period, and noticed that when it kicks in, my previous cardiovascular performance from childhood kicks in. I can go out and run a couple miles, I can have sex without running out of breath, do push-ups, and I can go up stairs without any problems. I have incredible cardio performance but only while under the effects of the medication, which is for a couple hours before going to sleep. When it wears off I go back to being out of breath and unable to do simple exercises because I simply do not have the performance to do so.

The medication is clonazepam, 0.5mg. It is intended to relax and sedate, however it simply gives me the ability to exert myself in ways I thought I had aged beyond ability. Is there any type of specialist I should be looking into or does this ring any sort of bell? If I could exercise during the day and have a normal sex life again without running out of breath and energy after 10 seconds (without needing to be under the effects of a sleeping pill) it would change my life."

Female. 25. White. 

I’ve had a slew of weird symptoms the last six months. But now I’m struggling to eat even half of one meal a day. 

Symptoms: 

- Loss Of Appetite: often never hungry, full very quickly if I eat. 
- Incredibly foul smelling urgent stools/diarrhea: this has only started the last two weeks. Diarrhea at night, usually after dinner, which smells incredibly bad. Sometimes in the morning on an empty stomach. Not always watery. 
- Painful and swollen feeling under left rib cage/bottom of left rib cage. It’s getting quite bad and uncomfortable. 
- Painful lower right back/feeling of swelling: around my kidney area. 
- Consistent weight loss: only becoming very noticeable in past two days, probably due to the lack of food. 
- Swelling and some numbness in feet and ankles: this swelling has been extreme recently (we are talking feet the size of bricks), sometimes for days on end. 
- Extreme fatigue, could sleep all day. 
- Extensive urination in odd patterns: sometimes I can pee, almost constantly, for one hour straight. I don’t go many times a day, but at least once a day one of those times is extensive. 
- Nausea and feeling faint. 
- Lump in neck: GP suspects thyroglossal cyst but ENT isn’t sure. 
- Lymph node swelling under arms sometimes. Not correlated with any known infection or virus. 
- Night sweats. Have had them for months, air con on full blast doesn’t even help. 

Tests already done: 

- Full blood count, normal with liver and kidneys fine. 
- Abdominal Ultrasound is normal (do these include the spleen because I think my abdominal pain is spleen related and it feels FUCKED) 
- Pelvic Ultrasound was normal.
- Have has colonoscopy and endoscopy within the last five years. Tested negative for lactose intolerance and celiac.
- Have already had mono years ago."
639,Please read my x-rays (broken foot),"Hi, so a few months ago I [22F, caucasian, 5'7"", 190 lb, no prior history of breaks] moved to a ""developing"" country with a shitty medical system that is also banned from imgur, so I can't upload my pics there. I can't put them in this post because of that so I guess if you comment I can pm you my xray pics?? Another suggestion is welcome. 

Anyway, 4 weeks ago today, I twisted my ankle while walking, heard a crack and couldn't put weight on it, so I went to the hospital and was told I broke my foot. They put me in a non-weight bearing half cast and told me 3-4 weeks. Sounded short so I asked my parents to send photos of my xrays to my doctor back home, who (begrudgingly, because he wasn't getting paid, yay America) told me 4 weeks in a non-weight bearing cast, 4 weeks in a walking boot. He's not answered any other questions since and his nurse told us just to listen to the doctors here which 1. I'd love to but they're also not responding to me and 2. even the citizens of this country told me to get a second opinion elsewhere and I'm really at the end of my rope at this point.

Anyway, I'm guessing what's wrong is a 5th metatarsal non-displaced avulsion fracture, but I really have no medical knowledge (there's jones fractures that are similar maybe it's that?? is that the only issue? is that the issue in the first place??) and I basically want opinions on what happened, and if the 4 weeks cast/4 weeks walking boot is fine. 

I also don't know what my next steps are, like I got a walking boot today but it hurts to walk still. Is that normal? Am I supposed to do physical therapy? Can I go back to swimming? Should I only be walking with the boot for short periods of time/use the crutches along with the boot for a while until I start building more strength? Sorry for all the questions, I've just been in the dark for the past 4 weeks and am so very, very frustrated with the doctors here and my doctor back home.

I can do stuff but on a much lower productivity scale and with no feeling of energy.I have never woke up feeling rested and have no appetite to eat.I can eat plenty when i start and enjoy some food, but never feel hungry even if i try not eat for days on an occasion.

Exercice like running or that have intense cardio are nearly impossible to me and drain me intantly.I have tried taking it slow but i wont change the uncomfortable feeling i have in my chest and shortness of breath.I went through pneumologist examination and told me its likely asthma,i also went through asthma back when i was much younger and got sick for a period of like a few months but it never relapsed again.Could my bad eating habbits played a role here,its weird to explain but there are days in which i feel i can breath better on occasion and that usually when i have a very healthy eating routine for a few days absecent of sugar and feels with vegetables.It may be just my idea thoough,is there a thing such as asthma triggered by bad eating habbits,cause no doctor seemed to ask me about diet?

646,Calcific Tendonitis in shoulder,"My details: White female, 38, 5ft3, 111lbs, no known conditions, non smoker, healthy and active. Live in the UK.

So here’s the story :

Pain in shoulder, had a scan which shows calcium deposits. (Can’t remember now if I had an MRI, but I definitely had an ultrasound)

Had physio, steroid injection... no better. 
Had guided barbotage ( they sucked out some calcium and the rest that was too hard, they jabbed with a needle and broke it up). 
That fixed it but only for two months and it started again. Slow gradual pain built up to how it had been before - very restricted movement/rotation, weak, difficulty sleeping etc. 
Went back and had the same again and the exact same thing happened - two months of being fixed, then it started again. 
I’ve since had shockwave treatment (paid for privately while I wait to see an MSK specialist on the NHS again). No improvement. 

I’m at the really bad stage again, I’m so miserable with the pain and tired from not sleeping well. 
The MSK appointment is with a view to referring me for surgery. 

My questions are: why has this happened? Is my body producing too much calcium? I’ve been googling a bit and there are conditions... don’t know if can go to my GP and ask for a blood test to show calcium levels. They’ve said there’s no reason for this happening so they may think I’m a hypochondriac.

Also why isn’t my body absorbing the calcium as it should, particularly after the barbotage and shockwave treatment?

Again is there something wrong with me? 

I’m worried I’ll go through surgery and then calcium will just grow back. 

I had an operation on my other shoulder a few years ago after an injury and was told they’d removed calcium deposits then (just in addition, while they were doing the main repair), and they’ve never come back ... 

I just want the pain over with but don’t want it back again."

It is now a dull ache on my hip even when I'm sitting and I now have pain along my lower back doing normal activities. This week whenever I attempted to run the pain would travel down from my back and shooting pain down my left leg to the point where my leg felt weak and like it was giving out.

Feel nauseas most of the time and drinking any liquid I have to ignore the gag reflex sensations (this is a new symptom) 

My question is, are there any common problems that happens to people who had surgery as a baby?

Please help I barely coping all I can do is stay in bed and I’ve been experiencing mental breakdowns due to being in pain constantly!!"
653,Pain in right armpit and some of breast,"I (19F) recently noticed an uncomfortable pain in my upper armpit a couple days ago that since hasn’t gone away. It also tends to spread towards the side of my right breast. I can’t feel any lumps, nor can my husband, it just feels tight. 

Because of the tightness he thinks it just might be a muscle strain from “too many push-ups” I did workout on Thursday, which was about when I can recall the pain starting, but when I use a muscle and joint rub to try to soothe the pain (which usually provides relief for me), or NSAIDs, it doesn’t really go away. 

I’m wondering if this is something I should just wait out to see if it goes away, or get it checked out sooner? Thanks in advance (no pictures because there’s no visible swelling)"

Female,

Non-smoker.

Im not a regular coffee drinker, in fact, I hardly drink it.

Yesterday I woke up at 10:00 AM feeling very nervous for my test, so I couldn't eat. I started to get sleepy and tired because I had no food so no energy. So, I decided to have some cold coffee (The one with cream). The bottle was about 500ml, I drank it evenly throughout the day. I had no food at all except for some rice at 7:00 PM.

When I tried to go asleep at 11:00 PM. I couldn't sleep, I was wide awake. I tried everything, I even went to have more rice (Because I read somewhere that it helped), nothing. 

Only at 5:00 AM was I able to force myself to sleep. I woke up at 7:00 AM though because I had to go to college. 

So, till now I dont feel tired at all and I'm very shaky, jittery and nervous. 

TL;DR 
I had too much coffee yesterday on an empty stomach and till today I'm having the jitteres."

657,17M Losing layers of skin from thumbs to the meat and weird nerve behavior,"So this is the second occurrence of this phenomenon for me. Basically, it starts with a very sharp pain on my left thumb when applying pressure but no visible damage, then over a few days I progressively lose layers of skin until it gets meaty (no bleeding but touching it leaves blood) . During the whole thing, my thumb becomes very sensitive, feels kinda numb and can suddenly induce pain for no reason. The first time it happend I just let it go away and it did after 1-2 weeks. Should I be worried, is there something i can do to treat/prevent it. 
The area affected is the under part of the thumb that you use to type on a phone.

Hi, so basically I've been worrying a lot about my hair, mainly because I've been growing it out for like 1 year and I like it this long. I don't know if this amount of hair is too little for what it should be or not but I think it is, I just want to know if it's normal or not. I think this has happened for a few reasons, one being because of my diet having a lack of protein and stress, both unsurprisingly because of school exams. I do stress out really easily and when making plans with my friends I do tend to stress and then end up making plans in case those plans I've already made work. I personally wish I didn't do this but I guess I can't do much about it. I just want to know if my hair is anything to worry about and if it's normal because I can't tell if im unnecessarily getting worried. Also some tips on how to prevent this would be nice. Thanks
Also, it is usually really thick but for some reason it's really thin this night."

(If it wasn't clear I wasn't circumcised). If I try to pull back the skin it becomes stuck, a clear ring of skin is too tight to pass over the head. My negligence to this issue was largely due to the assumption I made that all penises I saw on the internet looked the way they do simply because those persons were circumcised, while I was not. (In hindsight, that was a very bad assumption to make)

I've began attempting some stretches to loosen the skin over time, but I fear that even if I reach the stage where the skin is loose enough (which I hear can take months to years) it may become stuck behind the head, and cut off blood circulation to the head. I've done a bit of research and taken a look at [the phimosis journey](http://phimosisjourney.com/), and have determined I am in between Type 3 and Type 4. Now, I've read a few horror stories of circumcisions at adult ages online and am really unsure of whether to get a circumcision anyway and attempt to readjust, or try creams, or something else.

666,Worried about recurrent yeast infections,"Age 28, female

5'10/ 160 lbs/Caucasian

Meds - none

I     am getting some tests done later next week, so I will figure this  out    sooner or later. My issue has been over the last month I have had     stubborn yeast rashes on my arms and leg that weren't able to be     completely cured with topical Nystain. The Nystain reduced them,     seemingly getting rid of them, but they returned. Has anybody else here     experienced this who wasn't very immune suppressed? As in someone who     didn't have HIV, untreated diabetes or something of that nature? I   feel   fine otherwise, but this returning, persistent yeast on my limbs   has me   worried. As of right now, I have it nowhere else. I did get   scared for   awhile and thought I had a fungal eye infection, but the   mild redness  in  my eyes is too minor for that, and I have no blurred   vision, light   sensitivity or eye pain. I am at my wit's end here   currently. This   recurrent yeast has me worried, mainly for HIV   although I test negative   on an Oraquick test 4 and a half months post   exposure, and diabetes is   also something I wonder might be affecting   it. I have no noticeable   classic diabetic symptoms, but my diet on   busy days, and my family   history make it a possibility. Overall I am   just confused and a little   worried. Having to wait until Wednesday and   Thursday of next week for   these tests doesn't help the situation,   either.

Below   is a photo of my   arm. The quality isn't super good, but I feel it's   sufficient. It was   confirmed as yeast by my doctor a couple weeks ago.

I'm 28M, height - 180cm, weight - 75kg, no previous medical ailments apart from asthma which I'm not currently taking medication for, and I'm a non-smoker.

About 2 weeks ago, I had a sexual encounter with a guy I was dating. There was nothing penetrative, but I did perform oral on him. He did not ejaculate in my mouth. Although, I did have cuts in my mouth. I did not know his sexual health status, but he has told me he's a virgin.

Immediately the day after, I fell ill with allergy symptoms (i.e. blocked nose, sneezing, headache, clogged throat). That cleared up within a week and I felt fine. However, within 2 days I've come down with another bout of illness with the following symptoms (dry throat, lethargy, slightly blocked nose, mild headache, mild muscle aches).

I just want to know whether I've got anything to worry about regarding HIV? I'm going to get a blood test within the following week."

671,Autoimmune related?,"Autoimmune or not?

Hi all,  

I have been suffering for about 5 years (25/m) with still no diagnosis. I am not here looking for a diagnosis but for suggestions as to what I should have doctors look into next as they don't know themselves what to check so I'm trying to figure it out for myself so I can point them in the right direction.  

The first issue was digestive issues that started around 6 years ago, I have had an endoscopy where they took a biopsy and they said everything looks fine. My stools used to be very loose but the last couple years haven't been too bad, though I still have to use the toilet 5+ times per day (to poop).  

Then around 5 years ago I had a case of Labrynthitis (inner ear viral infection) and all my other symptoms seemed to start exactly at this time so I'm sure the virus has triggered this (which is why I suspect autoimmune). The symptoms are as follows:  
Dry mouth  
Fatigue  
Neurological decline (memory, problem solving skills have gone to shit)  
Excessive sweating  
Derealisation  
Sensitivity to loud noise  
Sensitivity to bright light (particularly sunlight)  
Balance/coordination problems  
Joint problems (stupid amount of injuries from working out even though I use good form and don't lift heavy)  
Alcohol intolerance (get drunk much easier and hangovers are 10 times worse than previously, rarely drink more than a pint or 2 now) 
Wounds take a long time to heal  

I was also diagnosed with psoriasis and Raynauds at a young age, had what doctors told me was a psoriasis guttate flair recently and it has cleared on my body but my head is still sore/itchy and it's causing bald patches on my scalp.  

I have had many blood tests in this time, and have been negative for everything except for slightly elevated liver enzymes but I have had both an ultrasound scan and a fibroscan on my liver and everything is fine. Have been tested for T1, T2 and insipdous diabetes, kidney functions, ANA and all were negative. Sjogrens syndrome seems to match my symptoms most closely but my rheumatologist doesn't believe in seronegative Sjogrens so has ruled that out, my blood tests were negative as was a lip biopsy.  

If anyone can hell I would be forever grateful!"

673,Hepatic encephalopathy? lasting brain damage?," 

My lovely but alcohol addicted brother suffered a series of seizures on Thursday, lasting for about 10 hours + (we are not sure when they started as he was found having seizures, so it could be way beyond 10 hours) . They managed at the hospital to stop them after very many hours. He bit his tongue during the seizures and they think he swallowed a lot of blood as a result.

He is now awake, sort of. He is making unintelligible noises. He has nystagma and is not focusing on anything. He does not respond to his name or simple requests. He does however respond to discomfort. In addition he has difficulty breathing (very labored and fast) - currently using an oxygen mask. They think he may have a chest infection - his temp is high. His blood pressure is also high. He showed no signs of recognizing me when I visited yesterday. CT scan normal. No MRI yet.

Previous hospital admissions: x3 duodenal ulcers and sepsis. Several visits for drainage of ascites. Four visits for seizures over the last 4 months. This episode seems far worse than any of the others where he did recover, enough to live independently etc.  


The questions I have are, is the current really quite severe mental impairment recoverable? A result of seizures? or is this possibly  Hepatic encephalopathy? Any insight on what is going on would be VERY much appreciated. I need to desperately understand and I need to start making some decisions on who to involve or not family wise etc (it's complicated).

His details are:

Age: 55 years old

Sex: male  
Height: 5'10  
Race: white  
Duration of complaint: 60 hours

Pre existing diagnosed conditions: cirrhosis (he is an alcoholic). They have mentioned that his liver may have entered the decompensated phase. Korsakoff.  
Recreational drugs: none, however he is an alcoholic of many years (20+)  
Smoking: yes

Previous hospital admissions: x3 duodenal ulcers and sepsis. Several visits for drainage of ascites. Four visits for seizures over the last 4 months. This episode seems far worse than any of the others where he did recover, enough to live independently etc."
674,Constipation,"I’m a 21 year old male and have been constipated for about 2 weeks now. I still have daily bowel movement but they are all small and incomplete. I have not had any diet changes, I’ve been eating pretty much the same stuff everyday for the past 8-10 months and all of a sudden I get constipated 2 weeks ago. Before this my stools were extremely giant and pretty soft but they were complete. 

I am a college cross country runner so lack of physical exercise is not causing this. It’s also not due to lack of fiber since I have an extremely high fiber diet (around 70g of fiber per day). I eat around 3,000 calories a day. I do not track macros. 

What is causing my constipation recently? Also when I do have bowl movements I do not push hard or struggle to pass them. They’re just small, often long and skinny and are always incomplete.

67kg
155cm tall
No medications
Relatively healthy

So about 6 months ago I was finally diagnosed as having ‘anaphylaxis’ to fruit and vegetables, meaning the allergy doesn’t happen in the mouth, rather the gut. 

I have had adverse reactions to eating most fruit and vegetables all of my life, mum hiding veggies by blitzing they in my meals just to see if it was all in my head, still had reactions. 

Approx 15mins after consuming, I get severe stomach cramps and end up on the toilet with diarrhoea non stop and at times vomiting too. My reactions are getting worse and when I could cook my potato and carrot in boiling water and have a steamer on top with broccoli and beans for the rest of my family, I cannot do any more. 

My worst episode was both for 8hrs. Needless to say I was very unwell and ended up with serious hemorrhoids which no amount of creams can get rid of. I’m reluctant to have surgery that has been recommended by my GP. 

I can eat potato, carrot, corn, cooked onion, cooked tomato (like in a pasta sauce that has been cooked for at least 4hrs), garlic, some herbs eg parsley and chives, no spices besides salt, pepper and saffron, lemon and lime. 

I feel like I can only have kids meals when I go out, fish and chips, cheese burger and chips (no onion or pickles). 

I am asking for advice please. Is anyone out there who has the same problem I do? Any suggestions on how I can get my life back? Please help!"

Stats: height 163cm, weight 53kg, Caucasian 

Problem:

Had severe period pain on the train. Pain was severe enough that my vision went hazy. Started to feel extremely nauseous, got off train and collapsed onto station bench. This is kind of normal for me. The next part is not normal, though:

Extremities gained severe pins and needles effect, could not feel through them, severe tremors throughout body, shallow breathing, tunnel vision, eventually my fingers became locked straight and were enormously difficult to move, as if in muscle spasm, like trying to move rocks. I needed external force to make them bend and couldn’t feel anything in them. I still had clarity of thought. I had trouble speaking so no one helped me, just walked straight past (keep in mind that I managed to just barely text my friend in plain English by jabbing at my phone with immovable fingers).

Episode slowly ended after 5-10 minutes, but still had shallow breathing and tremors for the next half an hour. Period pain continued at varying intensities for the rest of the night. Could not speak in full sentence English for 20 minutes, but could use my badly learned second language, Japanese, on call with my boyfriend.

Local doctors surgery kept an eye on my condition until boyfriend could pick me up after about an hour, but no examination took place.

Blood sugar should have been fine and had plenty to eat before the episode.

Can anyone offer some clarification over what happened to me? It was pretty frightening and the doctor I saw couldn’t explain it. :("

Main complaint is that ever since I banged my head a few months ago I’ve felt much more uncoordinated and clumsy. It wasn’t an extreme concussion as I didn’t pass out but it required me to stay home from work for two weeks. Could this head injury have worsened my already bad fine motor skills?

205 lbs

Caucasian

Around a 1.5 years

American and it is obviously located on my ass crack

No medication

This is a very long story and something I've been putting up with a year and a half. Basically in the very beginning I had a lot of pain kind of inside my anus, like it hurt very badly. So went to the doctor, they said it was swollen and probably a hemorrhoid. I was constipated too from the swelling so they gave me laxatives and I was actually okay for about 3 days. No problems, felt nothing there. Then I noticed a hard lump just under the skin, and the pain returned. No constipation this time. Just pain and this pea sized lump. 

I visited a general surgeon, he tried a bunch of stuff like antibacterial cream as he said the skin looked unhealthy. If I'm being honest it was probably due to me not being able to wash super well down there as to avoid ripping the skin open as it would bleed sometimes. Anyway, this did make the skin look healthier. Still didn't fix the other problem. So I get colonoscopy, no IBS or anything, most likely not a fistula. Problem keeps persistenting. Appearing to heal and then relapsing, over and over for so fucking long that it's making me suicidal, I swear to God. I wanted to join the military out of highschool but I can't because of this, it has ruined my life. So I had surgery to remove it, doc said it was a mass of dead tissue and a bunch of blood vessels forming to heal over and over.  That surgery was two months ago. It hasn't healed, [this](http://imgur.com/a/fOEORaW) is what it looked like 2 days ago after bleeding a fair bit after a shit. I just took [this](http://imgur.com/a/ykXAUED) picture like 15 minutes ago. I've never seen it look like that. Think it's infected? It sort of looks like puss. I've never discharged puss from that area in the entire time I've dealt with this btw. So I'm just looking for some fresh opinions on this. I honestly can't tell if what was bothering me is pre-surgery issue that is still there or if it's just the surgery wound still healing since the area is sensitive. Surgeon is adamant that he removed what was there. Point is it hurts and I'm tired of it. Making an appointment this Monday and hopefully can get referred to a specialist or something. Just looking for second opinions on this. Thank you :)"

Long story:
So yesterday I ended up getting a crazy bloody nose, blood was everywhere. It soaked paper towels soon as I put them against my face, and was overflowing down my throat. It was horrible, and my first ever crazy nosebleed. It stopped within 25 minutes 
I’ve had a fever since Monday(101.8F), it returns as soon as the DayQuil I’m on runs out, but goes away with the next dose. I’ve been to the doctor and they said it was just a cold. 
University staff saw my bloody face and immediately called an ambulance. They told me if I continue to feel bad I should go to the ER. 
I hadn’t blown my nose, or strained myself in any way before the nose bleed, in fact I had been sitting down in the movie theater of my university. 
I have my first ever Rheumatologist appointment tomorrow and I’ve been told to expect extensive lab work. So my primary care doctor chose not to give me medicine for my cold as it would disturb any labs. I’ve waited 4 years for any leads on why I’m having frequent debilitating chest pains and this might be it, so NOTHING can get in the way of these labs. I’ve had a positive Ana-test and frequent joint pains, and my doctor thinks I might have lupus and RA(but refuses to treat any pain without diagnosis)
Tuesday morning I’m going right back to the doctor to get re-evaluated for my cold, and hopefully some medicine. 
But I’m basically just curious about the correlation between the heart rate drop and nose bleed."

1. Itchy, randomly i get a urge to scratch it and peal the dead skin / skin growing around it (Its not like normal skin growing back, its frosty and blue i think, its weird.)
2. Sometimes  some liquid comes out of it, kind of like, it does not drip out, imagine licking your lips with a lot of saliva, it basically looks like that.

I honestly just want some advice regarding what this may be, if it looks like its healing, what I should do to make it heal faster

This is scaring me as i feel that I'm  losing my hair all over again. Is it normal to shed hair daily because I have read online that it is normal to loose 50 hairs a day. The size of the hair seems to be the one which is grown with minoxidil and finasteride. It is not that thick but seems to be fine hair but shorter than the usual length of hair on my scalp. I have read online that once we start using minoxidil and finasteride one will not lose hair after 3-4 months after initial shed.  Please  advise what should I do.

I’ve had a cough for about 3-4 weeks now. My family came down with the flu 5 weeks ago and I didn’t catch flu symptoms, just this cough. Two weeks ago I called Teladoc and was prescribed an albuterol inhaler and benzonatate 100 mg (take 2, 3 times a day as needed). I was also told to take mucinex. I’ve been taking the meds infrequently because I’ve felt very little relief from it. Steaming gives me temporary relief. 

I also have a runny nose and congestion. My lynph nodes have often been swollen. I just checked my throat and found that it has a few red, scratchy-looking streaks and my tonsils are really swollen with white dots on them. My cough is generally worse at night and the tickle in my throat causes me to cough to the point of gagging often.

Current smoker, very occasional drinker, and it has been a four years since any recreational drug use.



About five months ago I (presumably) tore a ligament in my right shoulder. After a visit to the e.r. I was given a 1mg dose of Dilaudid (hydromorphone) and was good and giggly within twenty minutes. Between a few repeat doses and some t3s over the next few days I was in control of my pain and able to still work with slightly modified duties.

Today I went in for what feels like the same issue but on my left shoulder. They gave me the 1mg dose, and then after no effect for 45 minutes gave me another, and finally sent me home to at least be miserable in a comfortable chair. An hour and a half later I took another 2mg Dilaudid tablet, and I feel... Nothing. No significant relief, no cloudiness and giddiness or even fatigue. 

A few weeks ago I was in significant pain over something else unrelated and I had a very low dose of methadone (save the lecture, I know it's stupid, I'm just trying to survive the present to the best of my ability) and after two hours felt no relief so had another very low dose. I didn't at any point feel pain relief, or the pleasant mental state that tends to come with that kind of medication. I did become very nauseated and vomit through most of the rest of the day.

I am wondering why suddenly medications that have always been effective for me, some as recently as five months ago, are suddenly not helping at all? Aside from Tylenol and naproxen, and lots of midol, these are the only pain killers I've had since 2016."

Ok. So I had a blood test done to test for herpes over the summer. To my surprise, the results came back showing I had been exposed to herpes HSV-2 at some point in my life. I've never had a cold sore anywhere to my knowledge and the test result turned my world upside-down. My doc at the time advised me to ignore the results, that it doesn't necessarily mean I have herpes, and if I've never had a cold sore I probably never will. 

Fast forward to this past Thursday. I'm getting over a cold and am working through my first week in an eating disorder clinic. A pimple shows up above my lip, and I attempt to pop it. It's sort of tender, but not unusual for other zits that've popped up on my face. Next day, it's a nasty scab. I happen to have a dr appointment and ask about it. Doc says it's probably herpes, swabs it, and tells me it is most likely HSV-1, even though my blood test didn't show exposure to that strain. 

Swab comes back negative, though my doc says the sore was probably too healed for the swab to pick up anything. Tells me again that it's likely still HSV-1 and reassures me that it couldn't  be HSV-2, ""unless [I'd] been giving oral to a penis covered in sores."" 

Now I feel like a whore and I'm ashamed of leaving the house with this visible mark on my face. 

If the blood test showed exposure to HSV-2, why is the md so sure that this cold sore on my lip is HSV-1?"

700,29 Y/O Female With Unknown Skin Rash On Inside of Thigh (Pic Included),"I started to develop a skin rash about a week and a half ago on my inner thigh. At first, I believed it to be some sort of jock itch or some sort of fungus of some sort but it hasn't improved. Originally, I had been putting an anti-fungal cream on it and spraying it with Goldbond powder spray to keep the area dry. The Goldbond relieves the weird sensation I feel on my leg but it doesn't make it smaller or anything. It looks like it is in a circle/multiple circle shapes, so ringworm has crossed my mind. Not sure how I would have gotten ringworm on my inner thigh. I will note that my parents cat is losing fur on his stomach/has weird spots and I mentioned to my mom weeks ago I thought the cat might have ringworm but she informed me that he was brought to the vet (on 10/17) and DIDN'T have ringworm. So, I'm confused. This hasn't spread to my partner that I sleep with every night or any other part of my body. It feels like normal skin when I touch it, it's not raised at all, it itched the first few days but then after that, nothing. Most of the time I forget it is there until I see it or my thighs rub together too much that day.

Only on birth control pill and Prilosec once a day

Im a student and I have really crappy state insurance so I don’t always see the most caring physicians (no offense). I saw someone 5 months ago for a routine physical (I waited 3 hours past my appointment) and everything was normal, however he said my lymph nodes in my neck were enlarged. I hadn’t noticed much. He didn’t send me anywhere and my labs were all normal. 

2 months later my lymph nodes are even bigger upon palpating, and they don’t hurt at all. I also have and had been experiencing horrible night sweats 1-2 times a week. I had not been feeling like myself, and just extremely fatigued. I went to another doctor since the last one didn’t have much of anything of to say. I told her my issues, and how it always feels like there’s a lump in my throat, and I can always feel it when I lay down on both sides of my neck as well. She felt mine, and sent me for an ultrasound of my neck. she also sent me for a swallow test, and put me on Prilosec because she thought I might have acid reflux (although I had no idea) the swallow test showed I have reflux. I called to get these results because no one contacted me after weeks. Turns out the ultrasound also shows I had an enlarged lymph node, her nurse says I need to get another ultrasound in 4-6 weeks to see if they go down. 

Is this normal procedure? I have seen all sorts of articles about types of lymphoma and the things I’m feeling/symptoms seem to match up. I just don’t want it being overlooked. I don’t know if I should get the first scans and get a second opinion, or what? The ultrasound tech even made comments about how it “didn’t look good” which made me feel terrible. 

I just don’t know what to do. I am scheduled for my next ultrasound in 2 weeks. However my sweats and fatigue have gone no where, and I can still feel the lump in my throat as well as lymph nodes when I palpate. Should I get a second opinion? Or just wait to see what this next ultrasound says?

The spots are red and slightly puffy, and the skin seems to be wrinkly inside these patches whereas the rest of my feet are smooth.


These patches are here when I wake up,  and slowly subdue over the course of the day, usually barely visible when i go to sleep at the end of the day. 

As far as feeling, there is no pain but a strange itching, like the flesh is itching rather than the skin itself. Almost like there hasnt been blood flow, and when I'm awake the flow returns and gets itchy.

Over the last few days these spots have grown and moved around each morning and become more itchy, and I can't find anything online about these kinds of spots. I'm quickly beginning to get pretty worried. Please help!"
709,Stitches from prolapsed bladder surgery passed in stool?,"Age: 67  
Height: 5'4''  
Weight: 140lb  
Medications: low dose pain medication for chronic pain stemming from head/neck/back injury  
Smoking status: yes, about one cigarette a day  
Location of complaint: abdomen--prolapsed bladder

I am actually searching for input/advice for my mother. She had surgery for a prolapsed ladder about three years ago. She chose to have it repaired with robotic sacrocolpopexy and opted for the mesh sling. The urologist however, decided not to use the sling in the middle of the surgery, and didn't bother to tell my mother until the next day. The other odd detail is the surgery was only supposed to take about two hours but instead took five. To make matters worse, as soon as the surgery was completed, the urologist disappeared. Like, she left the building, turned off her cell phone, and left no instructions or prescriptions for the nurses. When the nurses came to check on my mom they had no idea what to do for her. By the time they finally tracked down the urologist, my mom had been laying there in pain for hours.

Putting all these questionable details aside, my mother recently found what appears to be the stitches/sutures in her stool. She hasn't had any other type of surgery, so we're sure this has to be from the prolapsed bladder but we are so confused as to how this could have ended up in her intestines... how could she have passed it this way?

About two month prior to this, my mother noticed her lower abdomen was starting to budge (similar to way it had before she was first diagnosed with a prolapsed bladder). About a month of these symptoms, she went to the restroom expecting a bowel movement but was shocked to see nothing but blood. This only happened once, and she had reported all this to her primary care, but recent family emergencies have kept her from following up with the urologist who performed the surgery.

After finding what appears to be stitches/sutures, she called the urologist's office but the nurse who answered kept insisting that this kind of thing just doesn't happen. When my mom insisted that she wants an appointment to get everything checked, the nurse said she'd call back in a couple days. Still haven't heard back. The nurse's lack of urgency and attempt to downplay everything is infuriating. I'm hoping to get insight/advice for my mom about what might have happened here and what questions we should try to bring up when she does finally get an appointment."

715,Fever/chills/body aches ~8 hours after receiving this years flu shot,"22F; height 5 foot 4 in.; weight 105 lbs.; no medication/existing conditions. 

I received my flu vaccine last Saturday at around 4 pm. I went on about my day feeling fine and ate dinner as usual and then relaxed and went to bed. I woke up around midnight with chills and tried to go back to bed for a few minutes before I finally got up and checked my temperature. I had a fever of 101.7°f, this was around 8 hours after receiving the vaccine. As I was up and moving around to get some water and acetaminophen to get my temp down, I could feel that my body was aching—specifically my elbows/arms and my legs. I woke up again around 3:30 am and checked my temperature again, it was at 100.3°f. I stayed in and rested the next day, and the highest temp I recorded was 99.8°f. I felt just a little worn out for the duration of the day. By Monday morning, my temperature was completely back down to normal and I had no symptoms. I was not sick before I went in for the flu shot and had no symptoms. 

Could this have been caused by the flu vaccine?  If so, why? Any info is appreciated!"
716,Unsolved chronic stomach problems,"18M

I have very bad chronic constipation. I usually go about 3x/week and the stool is always very hard and wide and clogs the toilet nearly every time. I also have visible blood in the stool about 1x/week. The blood is a darker shade of red.

I also get very bloated after eating. My stomach noticeably distends and I feel extremely full and cannot eat for a long time afterwards, even though I have not eaten that much.

I am currently taking two tablespoons of lactulose (laxative) and 2 tablets of sodium docusate (stool softener) per day. I also eat 3 prunes per day.

About two years ago I went for about a year where I was severely malnourished and lost a dangerous amount of weight and almost starved to death. I do not know if the undernourishment could potentially have long term effects that are causing my problems.

DO NOT suggest that I drink more water or eat more fibre. I drink more than enough water and eat more than enough fibre. If the problem were that simple I would have solved it a long time ago.

Any opinion/suggestion/advice is appreciated.

718,Amnesia like symptoms for 4 seconds at a time,"
Female, 18, uk, 5’3, social drinking and smoking, no drugs, 4 years ago had 3 abnormal ecgs that were never followed up.

So I have a load of symptoms that don’t seem related to eachother at ALL and I’ve put them into 2 categories, brain and hormonal

Brain
- Forgetting who I am, what I’m doing and where I am at the same time as a sharp intense pain in the back of my head but this only lasts for around 3-4 seconds before it is back to normal. I had this happen for the first time about 5 weeks ago and has happened to me about 7/8 times
- 2 days ago I woke up with intense dizziness so bad I couldn’t stand up straight but slowly went away after a while. I now have dizzy spells on and off.
- 2 days ago I also woke up with blurry vision that went away at the same time as the dizziness
- Tired all of the time, even after sleeping for 10+ hours
- Cold almost always as well

Hormonal
- missed my period for 2 months until today when it’s started
- Constant period like cramps since a month & a half ago
- Spots and oily skin on my face, back, breasts and thighs for around a month
- Tender breasts for a month
- Pink discharge 2 days ago
- Need to wee all the time
- Loss of bladder control

I rang my gp yesterday and she said is there any possibility you’re pregnant and I said no (never had sex with a man), she pushed for a pregnancy test and booked me in for an appointment with a nurse on Tuesday. She told me to ring 111 or go to A&E if it gets worse.

Later that night it happened again and I rang 111 (medical helpline) for a second opinion, after listening to all my symptoms she asked me a few questions that I hadn’t even thought of ,like weakness in my left leg and stumbling over words. I ended up being passed on to a senior clinician who told me to go to a&e.

At a&e I was put into majors and had blood taken, I didn’t find out the results but I assume they were fine bc I never heard about it again, my heart rate was constantly 100+ bpm, and my blood pressure was 147/79. The doctor listened to my “brain” symptoms and kept putting words in my mouth and insisted that I was having a throbbing pain instead of sharp pain. He told me I was just having migraines and that I’m fine and all my vitals were fine, he did some nervous system tests and said I was fine, he later came over again and said he forgot to do some of the other nervous system tests and needed to do them, he also took an ecg and said that was fine. I wasn’t convinced about it being a migraine, I asked about my other symptoms and he told me to see my gp about it. Then I was discharged.

I feel so embarrassed that I’m making all this drama over a migraine but I don’t think that the severe confusion is from a migraine and it doesn’t seem normal to me. I dont feel like I’m being taken seriously, and it’s scaring me so much I don’t want to drive or go out in case it happens again. I also don’t know if my hormones relate to my headaches and would just like a second opinion, thank you so much for reading if you’ve got this far!"

Hi, so my mattress sheet would always be slipping out of my mattress every time I sleep. I was planning to buy ones that had a curve inside to prevent this but during the mean time, I used safety pins to stick the sheets to the bed. I am living in an old furnished apartment on rent and I don't know hold long this mattress was used for, but the safety pin that I tried to stick as deep as I can into the bed, scratched my hand and causing a little bit of bleeding. Now, is there any sort of disease i should be worried about?"
720,Why is my doctor referring me to haematologists?,"24F. 5”3. 122lbs.

I had a scan 3 weeks ago, spleen size was 9.3cm on ultrasound. All ok.

Had one at public hospital by doctor referral on thursday and they said it is slightly enlarged or ‘larger end of normal’ and a bit ‘bulky’ but wouldnt say the size.

I had a private scan yesterday and it was 9.7cm. Does this mean its grown? Or does it just vary? Is it because I’ve been complaining about back pain? My appetite has been so up and down, as well as my weight, back pain and early satiety. I’ve been so anxious. I know I have a problem but I am going to therapy for this soon.


I am just concerned that I have been told my spleen is enlarged and have been referred to a haematologist. My doctor felt my lymphs and my blood tests, liver, thyroid, FBC and pancreas markers were normal.

I also wanted to know..


My back where it hurts is harder/a bit more swollen than the right side. Could this be a lymph node or my organs being pushed by my enlarged spleen on my back? Or just muscular.

Could my appetite and weight loss be sinister? I have gone from around 9 stone to 8 stone 7lbs in a month.


I am so scared of lymphoma or leukaemia now. I just want to live a normal life and now this has thrown me and scared me. Maybe my doctor referred me because I’ve been so anxious and they want to be sure and cover themselves too? I dont know how this works. Please share your advice. Again, I know this is frustrating and I have anxiety. I’m seeking help for it but I am just so worried for my health. I was getting better until this came up. 


My original worry was cancer like PC due to yellow stools, weight loss and back pain and gastritis. My stools arent yellow now, but have had a lot of soft stools, a bit diarrhoea like but thick. My weights stayed around 8 st 8 for 2 weeks, fluctuating up and down. My ribs also pop on the left side when I’m laying in a certain position.


Also could my partner massaging my back have cause it to swell?"

From what he has told me, prostrate cancer has a high survival rate and isn’t that bad, as far as cancer goes. However, I would like some more info, especially from a medical professional, as there is the concern that he is not revealing all he noes about it so as not to upset me and my brother.

If this will kill him, what kind of time frame are we talking about. Months? Years? Decades?

I'm pretty sure it's mental but after reading online (something that isn't good for anxiety), I just had a question or two. 

My blood was tested earlier this year and everything was fine. My glucose was *just* tested and it was 4.8 a1C. The only health issue I have is high blood pressure, but I'm on medication to regulate that and my weight used to be higher, and I've been working on getting it down.

I guess my question is, if it happens that suddenly, it's mental? And how fast does something like bad cholesterol rise if the numbers were good just months ago? I can't understand how this could have happened within an hour and now I can't do anything when I was just fine before. I would think that even a physical issue would produce a gradual result and not something that is akin to snapping fingers and it stopping.

Now my anxiety is through the roof (I have a history of it anyway) and I know that's making it worse, which is why I'm trying to find answers. I have a urologist appointment on the 18th but I need some sort of peace of mind until then."

I'm a 22F, white, 5'1 and 148ish lbs. 

My wife is on birth control that causes her to have periods every 3 months, so I assumed that was the cause of my weird periods, but now I'm not so sure.

We've been living together for about 3.5 years and my periods haven't really synced up with hers, but rather have nearly stopped. I feel like I only really have something like 1-3 periods a year. (I'm sorry, I don't track them because I'm horrible with things like that). When I DO have a period, it's light and easily managed, only a few stomach cramps that aren't really even that bad. 

Enter last week: my period started for the first time in probably 5-6 months or so. It started normal: light, no cramps. But about 3 days ago the cramps got really bad, and I'm going through a pad every few hours. Definitely abnormal for me.

728,Alone in a foreign country with a mysterious sickness,"I’ve been traveling alone in Colombia since the end of September. Everything was going fine health-wise until about two weeks ago, right when I took a plane from the Caribbean coast (lots of mosquitos and biting flies) to Bógota, which at almost 9000 feet high is one of the world’s highest capital cities. I started feeling run-down and got a headache. I thought it was just the elevation at first, but I’ve been at slightly lower elevations now for a whole two weeks and the fatigue is just getting worse. It’s to the point where I’m sleeping 11 hours per night, and I can barely make it outside for two hours a day or walk a couple miles, whereas earlier in the trip I was hiking up to 15 miles some days with so problems. The headache is stubborn, and when I shake my head the back of my head hurts, especially the right side. Occasionally I get a sudden stabbing pain in my inner ear or throat. I have a very slight fever 99F) and trouble concentrating.

I went to a hospital yesterday but they told me “this is not an emergency” and just told me to take ibuprofen, which I guess was fair. I probably should have just gone to a clinic, but I was really worried as I never get symptoms like this and I don’t have a good sense of the types of diseases that are common here—better safe than sorry, right?

The good news is my flight home is in just a couple days, although I’m really not looking forward to the long journey at this point.

Could I have some kind of tropical, mosquito borne disease like dengue fever, and/or could I still have altitude sickness even though I’m now only at 7000 feet? I’ll get checked out right when I get home, i just want to know in a general sense what I might have so that I don’t catastrophize too much and jump to the worst-case possibilities."
729,My period is being abnormal,"So, I (18F) usually have an irregular period which sometimes takes more than one month to reappear. I got my period at the beginning of the month and then again toward the end of the month two (a week or so ago). When I got it the second time there wasn't nearly as much blood as usual and it was over within 2-3 days. And now, a week later, I got it again. I'm thinking (perhaps hoping a bit) that it might be implantation bleeding and that I'm pregnant. However, I was getting a birth control injection every month while I was living temporarily in another country, and I still got my period while getting the shot (although irregular as always). The shot was supposed to be last effective September 30 (today is November 3rd). And I've been having sex frequently throughout the whole month of October. 

I thought maybe the bleeding might be nothing serious, but I can't shake the thought that maybe it's implantation bleeding. I just don't know how likely that is and I need to know if it's even worth worrying about."

Tl;dr: Red, itchy, and sometimes dandrufy spots appeared on my skin under my beard out of nowhere. I've also had issues with dandruff on my head before this, but never with my beard. Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/QgM94Jz .The beard has just been washed and I applied a bit of moisturizer, and I took the pic with flash, so it slightly affects how this thing looks like. Third pic has a bit of that dandruff thing. The spots are only under my beard, which is the shape and size of a goatee.

I've been growing my beard for a while now. I've been maintaining it pretty well, washing it, trimming, moisturizing, using oils etc

About a week or two ago, i had this one spot under my chin that felt a bit itchy, so i scratched it a little. It kept itching, so I looked at that spot in the mirror with a flashlight and it was red. Whatever, maybe I just scratched it.

A few minutes later, another spot got itchy, I went to the mirror, and that spot was crusted? with somewhat thick dandruff I assume (never had dandruff in my beard before), so I got that off, went to wash and condition my beard, and it was more or less fine.

Over the next few days I'd check the spots with a flashlight, and they looked the same, red and kinda reflecting the light a bit if that makes sense. Dandruff appeared randomly, it'd get kinda itchy. I decided to try to soak my chin/beard in apple cider vinegar, and this helped with the itchyness and one of the spots dissapeared.

Today I noticed that some of the spots are back and itchy, so I did the cider wash, then contidtioned it and the skin, and when I checked now, the spots seem bigger and more spread.

Hello wonderful people. For about 2 years already I (27F) have been going through a series of stressful events in my life that have hit hard and taken a toll on me. I had to leave my family, sell all my belongings and start from scratch in a foreign country, been through multiple unfortunate situations at my workplace, been through lots of xenophobia and last but not least I lost my job 2 days ago. Every time something very stressful like all I have described happens I start spotting. The lasting of it dependes on how long I stay stressed, it can be up to a month or just 2 weeks. It can be just a light Brown spotting or it can be bloody or dark Brown - almost black. No matter what, it always happens. If I have my emotions balanced and everything's going good then im ok but something happens and boom, spotting. Is there something I can do to prevent this from happening? It itself stresses me out because I don't like it.

I should mention that I'm on the pill and have been taking it non stop for about 4 years already because I suffer from endometriosis, have tried most medication available (progestin-only pills and IUD as well as the arm implant, Zoladex shots for over 2 years to try to reduce the cysts, and danazol, went through laparoscopy surgery to try to remove it but the endometriosis cyst was/is located in a very delicate and risky area of my rectum/cul-de-sac so it was impossible, but I did respond wonderfully to taking the combination pill non stop to not have my period ever (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol  pills 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg, tried others that only caused me the worst pain ever)"

Today I noticed that when I pressed on the lower left central ribs vs the right side, the left ones I could press down a lot farther, and almost seemed softer. I did sense some shifting/possible rubbing as I did so and when I turn over on my left side. I will be going in next Thursday to get the pins in my hand out, but should I tell them or a family doctor? Also might now that I did not take an ambulance to the hospital so I was dropped in the EC not the ER.

739,Odd persisting pain under my arm,"So I'm not sure if this is anything or not, but here's what is going on.

About 2 weeks ago I caught a cold, a few days later had a slight ache in the area between my right triceps and armpit on the bottom/back side.  I am an active 25 y/o male and practice hot yoga and weightlifting, so at first I thought I may have tweaked something in my arm and would practice massaging/rolling techniques in that area which didn't help.  Later I was told it was probably a lymph-node and I shouldn't have been messing with it, but I have never had soreness during a cold in one before which is odd to me

I lost my cold after a week, but the pain persists.  It feels like a sharper pain now, but only occurs sporadically, sometimes when deep breathing, twisting, or reaching.  I tried to feel if I observe any swelling and I think there might be some, but it is hard to tell in the location that it is as I have large shoulders and arms.

Does this sound like something familiar? Is it possibly a lymph-node that I aggravated too much and just needs time to heal, or should I go to a doctor somewhere to have it checked out?

740,"Severe leg pain, doctors keep focusing on an apparently different issue.","45 yo male, Canadian, 150 lbs, Caucasian.

For a week now, my leg has HURT. It started with a severe burning pain in my thigh, and has spread from the hip joint to the mid shin, with the worst spot depending on what position I'm in(standing - thigh; legs elevated - shin; sitting - hip). I've had no injuries that should account for this, and no medical history of leg issues ever.

I went to the ER and they've been treating it as a kidney stone, which was found with a regular ultrasound a few weeks ago. I have a lot of history with stones, this does not in any way feel like a stone. My kidney area, bladder, and urethra feel just fine. Urination is normal in volume, colour, and pressure. I keep getting sent for x-rays, ultrasounds, and a CT scan, but they keep focusing on the kidney area and show no interest in the leg at all, no matter what I say.

Painkillers help somewhat but by no means make me feel normal. Pain is present even on morphine. The issue doesn't seem to be getting better or worse, and it's been a week now. Any ideas?"

Once I reached 120, I increased my intake to about 1600-1800 calories a day to maintain and have been doing that for around 2 weeks. I noticed my period was lighter than normal the last time I had it (August) and then it didn’t come in September or October. Also forgot to mention i’m not sexually active either. I was really hoping it was a fluke but I’m pretty sure it’s because I wasn’t getting the proper nutrients/giving my body enough energy. I still weight train but I don’t do any cardio so it’s pretty minimal. I’m also trying to pay more attention to my nutrients and macros. I really just want my period back though, and I know it’s what is needed. What I’d like to know is if you think what i’m doing now is sustainable and will get my period back?

None of them can tell me what it is or what really causes them, but the neurologist told me it’s a high possibility that it’s due to my migraines that I get. I was just wondering if anyone on here has seen this before.

Edit: wanted to add that I get zero symptoms besides the flashing. No headaches or anything."

Evening!  
On Tuesday 10/29 I received an ESI in my C-5 and c-6 for cervical radiculopathy. so far it has helped with my numbness.the doctor that did it in Chicago is one of the best. Dr. Amish Patel. I have not had pain since. but I have had arm tingling that comes and goes in waves. I asked the Dr and he told me it could be a Cortizone flare up and irritation of the nerve to the medication.  
1) is this accurate about the flare up?  
2) is the tingling common after?  
3) is lightheadedness normal after a ESI a few days out?  
Secondly   
about a month ago I noticed my legs would have tingles from the knees down.  I have minimal weakness and occasional cramping in my calves and feet.  doctors cant pinpoint this... I had a full brain MRI with and without contrast.. a cervical/thoracic/and lumbar MRI... Brain- fine, Cervical bulging c5/6 and arthritis for thoracic. Lumbar is still in review.

&#x200B;

Can this be Sciatic? can the numbness from sciatica come without the pain? i have any pain etc...

&#x200B;

Im getting concerned as im having trouble reaching my toes(i have to really force the bend or movement to touch.. ) and have noticed my calves are super tight...

747,NSFW *WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES* Do I have IBS?,"\*GRAPHIC  DETAILS\*

&#x200B;

To give a little background.

I am a 22 y/o male and have never had any major medical issues my entire life. This started back around late March/early April. I started having issues with my stools, when I would go they would be mushy and float at the top (thats the best way I can describe it). But this issue has progressed to where I have soft stools for the most part now that range in various size and texture and sometimes if I have ""hard"" stool it appears very cracked and usually has what looks like mucus in the stool. Sometimes I have to use the restroom multiple times in a day, sometimes back to back. Other days I only have to go probably a couple times (I have always had an active system though and when I had healthy bowels it wasn't unordinary for me to go a couple times a day). I had a normal bowel movement the other day which I haven't had in months. I have taken some pictures of what my stools have been looking like so I can show a doctor if/when I make an appointment. But when I went to wipe today my mucus looked dark so I took a picture of it in hopes that I can get some insight before I see a doctor. My other symptoms are sometimes feeling bloated, tired, sore joints, stomach ache/abdominal pain. But the severity of these symptoms fluctuate widely. Some days I will feel 100% and other days these things can slow me down. It is November now and I am embarrassed that I have let this issue go on for this long. My whole life I have had no issues whatsoever  with my whole body and I have always had very healthy bowel movements and I am worried because I don't want to have colon cancer or anything serious. Plus I am a very anxious person so I don't think that is helping at all. I haven't noticed any weight loss (I don't even know the last time I weighed myself). However, my appetite has been effected but I think this is probably more related to the constant stress and anxiety than my issue itself due to the fact that some days I am hungry and some days I'm not all that hungry. This issue has SEVERELY affected my social life. I haven't gone out and hung out with friends in a while due to the possibility of me having to constantly run to the restroom and my overall motivation and drive for everything has just slowed to a stop. I hate how my life has become and want to have this issue fixed but wanted to get some insight before I made a doctors appointment.

I am attaching pictures of what my stools have been looking like and the mucus when I wipe. 

Thank you to everyone who reads this and gives some insight!

748,Puncture During Atherectomy,"60M, Height 5’11”, Weight 180, medications: Plavix, 20mg insulin daily, 80mg Lipitor, Non-smoker, recent amputated right leg/quintuple bypass in the last year.

In June, my dad had an atherectomy in his left leg for three clogged arteries (80-95 percent blocked.) When the surgeon came in the day of the atherectomy, the surgeon appeared extremely fatigued and frazzled. My dad asked out of concern and the nurse said he had done 7 surgeries so far that morning. 

A week later, his leg was extremely swollen and he was in a lot of pain, so he went to the emergency room. His cardiologist recommend a CT scan of his leg. The results of the scan showed that the surgeon that performed the atherectomy punctured a hole in the artery. Now it's bleeding into his leg and another vascular surgeon is recommending an surgery to repair the damage. 

Should he seek the advice of the attorney or does this seem to be an honest, common mistake?"
749,Is this an external hemorrhoid? What do I do?,"Hi! 

Two days ago I noticed an uncomfortable sensation around my anal sphincter. Somewhere between pain and itchiness, but not severe in any way. I was a little constipated that day and figured it was a result of my strained bowel movement.

Today while showering I noticed that the sensation was still there. After feeling around I discovered that there is a tiny bead sized lump beneath the skin on the outside of my anal sphincter. 

After some quick research I figured it may potentially be an external hemorrhoid. I’ve posted some photos of it below in hopes of someone being able to diagnose it and suggest what I do next.

I feel that I should give it a week or two to see how it progresses and then decide whether a doctors appointment is necessary. It feels like an embarrassing problem to have given its location so I would like to avoid a doctors visit if possible.

2 weeks ago I got hit quite hard on the ring finger of my right hand, right on the articulation between my middle and proximal phalangeal. It hurt and I couldn't move it. The next day I went to the doctor, they checked it with xrays and it wasn't broken, she told me it was most likely capsulitis so she immobilized my finger and told me to take it off ina week or so and also gave me some painkillers in case it hurt (I didn't take them since it didn't hurt). 2 weeks after the finger is better, it doesn't hurt at all if I don't move it but I can't move it much without it hurting and the articulation is still swollen, the skin on the area doesn't have a particular color though.
Is it following the normal process of healing or should I go to the doctor again? They didn't tell me how long was going to take to heal and I forgot to ask. I will upload pictures, I can't right now.

755,FDA Regulation RE: Controlled Medication,"25y/o M, 190lbs, White, Male here diagnosed with ADHD

&#x200B;

I've been prescribed to take 60mg Adderall IR (30mg x 2/d, then 20mg x 3/d) for ADHD over the past few years. I switched to a new doctor and a few months later, the doctor tells me that FDA limits the amount he can prescribe me, so new doctor asked me to try 20mg ER in the morning and 20mg IR in the afternoon instead.

I was willing to try the change and the ER does seem much smoother, but I feel the rebound effect of hyperactivity at around 2pm! I let my doctor know and the doctor said the maximum they could change it to was 25mg ER and 20mg IR. Is that true? Would it make sense for me to get a second opinion from another doctor? This is impacting me at work since I usually work 10:30a-6:30p. :\\ Is there any 'wiggle room' here?"
756,"24, male. Have a question about refilling prescriptions without having to see my PCP to write them out every single time","Hey  I'm not sure if this is the correct sub for this question, but I'm  having quite a hard time finding out the answer to my question.

I'm  American and had insurance through my university as a student. After I  graduated, I just went without health insurance until I landed a job  which provided a health plan (about 3 months). While a student, I took  Lexapro and Xanax for 2 of my years there and it helped me quite a lot.

After  I graduated, I decided to take not having health insurance as a test to  see if I thought I still needed my prescriptions, because I could no  longer fill them (At least to my knowledge I couldn't, American  healthcare is confusing). While a student I saw my psychiatrist once a  semester just to check up on things. We quickly found what worked for me  and I would just come in once a month to get my prescriptions (30 10mg  lexapro a day and 45 0.5mg xanax every two months).

I'm  not going to get too into it, but I still definitely would benefit from  them. Those three months did not go as smoothly as I'd have liked.  Recently, I saw my PCP and he's making it pretty difficult to do this. I  know this regiment works for me, but he wants me to come in for a check  up every single month and talk about how I'm doing. This is nice and  all, but I'd rather not use all my PTO for this and pay for the out of  pocket visit until I hit my deductible. I already owe $200 for the visit  don't want to rack this up for medications that I used to just pay $10  out of pocket for.

Is  there any way I can just refill them online or something? I just want  to be able to stop by a CVS once a month and not worry about scheduling  appointments around work every month"

758,Gross looking skin lesion with Sjogren's syndrome.,"Posting for my grandma.

Female, 89, 5'2"", 140 lb. Southern Europe and ankle. Diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome with cryoglobulinemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism and the usual laundry list of old people diseases.

Current medications: Deflazacort 30mg and hydroxychloroquine 200mg for the Sjogren, something I can't remember for hypertension (I remember reading something about potassium on the PIL, though) and levothyroxine 25mg for hypothyroidism. She also takes aspirin 100 mg, I believe is to avoid a stroke (she got the prescription after having some stroke-like symptoms, losing vision in one eye IIRC, it went away with the aspirin), and calcium and ibandronic acid (the latter once a month) for osteoporosis.

At almost 90, she obviously doesn't drink, smoke or uses drugs.

At the start of summer, her ankles started to swell. Went to the GP, who prescribed compression stockings and changed her previous hypertension pill (she said something about potassium) for lisinopril and furosemide. One of her ankles was more swollen than the other and kind of red, the GP gave her antibiotic thinking that maybe there was an infection. It got better.

As far as I know (and as far as the GP knows, I think) there was no lump, nothing there.

But a couple of weeks ago she started complaining that she had a lump on her ankle, she says that she had it since summer (but didn't tell the GP in June, I went with her) that it was small then and now is bigger. She's starting to forget stuff so we take everything she says with a grain of salt.

&#x200B;

We went back to the GP October 22th, who was pretty stumped. She said that maybe it was an infected cyst or an infected lipoma but wasn't sure, and prescribed Varidase (Streptodornase and Streptokinase) and Cefditoren. Also changed the lisinopril for something else for hypertension because Grandma complied it was giving her dry cough. Told us to return in two days, we did and she said it looked better. It was flatter but wider. My mom said it looked worse, I said the GP had said that it looked better, grandma's next appointment with her rheumatologist is next week so we decided to wait until then.

&#x200B;

Thing is, it was still flat but wider a couple of days ago but it didn't look bad either, but today it looked kind of gross. Grandma says it doesn't hurt but tingles like it was infected (?). We're unsure if it merits a visit to Urgent Care.

759,Sinus infection or something else?,"I am a 19 year old male. I work with kids and don't have the best immune system. My symptoms have been prevalent since mid september (2019) but have gotten worse in the past week. Otherwise I have been relatively healthy this past year aside from a strep throat infection in March. That I did not get treated in time which led to a case of reactive arthritis, which I am still dealing with. 

I got a bad cold about a month and a half ago. Lasted almost a month and then I started feeling better for about a week. Then last Sunday (10/27) I noticed some white spots on my tonsils and had a very sore throat (no fever). I was initially worried it was strep but since I did not have a fever I decided to wait a few days. Over the course of the week it seemed to develop into another head cold. The white dots disappeared but my sinuses got more and more congested. My throat was hurting less but became irritated from postnasal drip and dry air. On Friday (11/1) I got a really bad headache halfway through my work shift. The pain was right around my sinuses, above my eyebrows, under and behind my eyes, and in my ears. Initially I thought it may be a migraine as my job is pretty stressful and I had had a busy week. It felt a bit different than my usual migranes though and was not made worse by noise or light, which I usually experience when I get migraines. I decided to rest and sleep as much as I could after I got home from work Friday. I woke up on Saturday (today) feeling a bit better with no headache. Only to be struck by the same exact headache around the same time (11am). This time it has not gone away no matter what I do. My sinuses are so plugged and sore and the pain is excruciating. I have been using my neti pot at least once a day this whole week. I also have developed a low-grade fever (100.4°F). I have tried breathing in steam, using a humidifier, and other remedies but nothing helps with the pain. I have also taken behind the counter nasal decongestants that have not helped at all. The only thing I haven't tried is a nasal spray. I am planning on going to urgent care tomorrow since this is the most sinus pain I have ever been in and I can barely keep my eyes open. There is some swelling around my eye on the left side, where the pain is more intense. Do you think this is a sinus infection or something else? I have had sinus infections in the past but they have never hurt this bad. I also have a wet cough that is worse when I lay down and some mild stomach pain (not nausea just discomfort)."

7 ish years ago I noticed a lump on my neck, right side, kind of right below where my earlobe ends (but it’s on my neck). 1 cm and smooth. Moveable, but hard. Doesn’t hurt and never has. No fever and no other symptoms. Campus doctor brushed it off said it’s a lymphnode and that happens sometimes. 

Years passed and it came and went. Sometimes it would be there, sometimes it wouldn’t be. It usually is not. When it comes back, it’s always this same size. I got a new doc in March 2018 and it was back, she was nicer but basically said it’s no big deal it’s probably a swollen lymphnode. 

Well it came back again this week. I’m not sick and never have been when it shows up. Had to see a different doc because mine is OOO for 2 weeks, he was extremely rude and treated me like a hypochondriac and said “ok well if this thing bugs you then get it removed”. Told me I was freaking out over nothing before he even felt it. After feeling it he wrote “lymphadenopathy” on my chart and said “go get surgery if you’re that stressed”. 

I have no idea what to thing. He said it feels close to the skin, but doesn’t think it’s a cyst bc it’s not painful or red. Said it’s probably a lymphnode. But like... that can’t be good can jt? Everything I’ve seen online points to lymphoma. My paternal grandfather had it in the 70s so I’m really scared. I’m going to schedule with my PCp when she is back, but In the meantime I’m terrified.

My hair is fine, btw. It's got a few white hairs but nothing out of the ordinary.

My other theory is that it coulb be genetics, since both my father and his brothers started having white hair at a fairly young age, but not as young as me. Also it could be stress, but I'm not sure how that works either. Can anyone help?

773,do i have cancer,"male , 20 , morocco , 5'8 , 95 lbs , so i feel normal during the whole day until it time to go to the toilette , every night after i finish pooping i feel some pain mixed with itch and discomfort in my anus for hours  , i also forgot to mention it so hard for me to poop , i have to sit for minutes for the poop to come out and when it do  , it doesn""t come out fully but in pieaces ( pieaces that are long and looks like a worm and they're NOT hard , just normal  and kinda watery sometimes ) , and i have to go 4 to 5 times to the toilette so the poop inside me come out fully and all of it , anyway what pugs me is the pain and itch i feel in my anus after pooping , i searched in google and it said i have colon cancer , i'm scared ."
774,Why have I shrunk 1 inch over the past year at 24 years old? (Already accounted for measurement time of day),"I have already accounted for measuring at different times of day.  11 months ago my morning height was 6 ft and 1/2 inch (184cm) . Now morning height measures at 5 11 1/2 inch (181.5 cm). 

What could have caused this? Disc degeneration? 

The only explanation I could think is that I spend many hours hunched over a computer for work. I’ve always had chronic neck pain/stiffness since childhood and lately stiffness/dull pain in the upper back.   

I often have my girlfriend walk on my back to “crack” it which I know is bad. I have since stopped that and focus more on stretching and strengthening my back. 

Do you think my neck and back stiffness is the cause of my height loss?"
775,No immunity to MMR after 2 shots?,"I have had two doses of the MMR vaccination but have not developed titers to Measles (I did develop them for Rubella and Mumps after the first dose).

I have had extensive immune system testing, which included a CBC with diff, a full lymph prolif, Titers, Immunoglobulins  (primary & secondary), etc and nothing was noted other than the lack of immunity to MMR and Hep B. I received 1 dose of the MMR as a child but no Hep B (it would have been around 1980).  

The immune system testing was ordered after I recovered from a case of mildly disseminated shingles a few months ago. I did develop over 4k  antibodies to Zoster after 1 gram Valacyclovir (so I had a good immune response).

No history of cancer at this point.

I am just interested in a non-committal opinion because my Immunologist and Internist (GP) are both scratching their heads.

Sex: Male; Age: 42; 190lbs; 5'10"" Race: Caucasian 

Medications/Vaccinations: Pravastatin 20mg; Vitamin D (2k IU daily); (2) of (3) Gardasil 9 vaccinations.

Labs: All routine results have been historically normal (with exception of Vit D deficiency &  moderately high cholesterol), HIV, HSV, Hep B & C and Syphilis tests all negative (all taken post any exposure). CT scans of my pelvic, abdomen, chest & neck normal last year (other than 1 benign adrenal nodule).

776,18F Food poisoning?,"I've been throwing up on and off for the past three days. Two days ago and today were probably the worst, but yesterday I thought I was completely fine. I believe it's food poisoning because I have no symptoms other than nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. What should I do?"
777,Vitamin D deficiency and my muscles - Is this why I'm weak and have no energy?," Male, 5'8, 83kg, no medications, no health conditions, not a smoker or drinker. Duration is around a year, location is everywhere with muscle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have a severe Vitamin D deficiency that I got diagnosed with a year or so ago. I was issued ""Osteocaps"" 1000U, and to take one daily out of a bottle of 60. I've to take them for the rest of my life, apparently.

After I finished my first bottle, I went through a bout of being down in the dumps and didn't really care about taking them, as I saw them as something that would help with just tiredness and not much else. I know it was a really stupid move, but I didn't take any and haven't done for about 10 months(got them 12 months ago).

I started working out properly around 8 months ago. My muscle has grown a lot, but I usually enter the gym feeling very weak and having no energy, despite following the right nutritional advice like eating natural sugars/carbs before the workout. I feel like my muscles are just constantly weak and lacking energy, and at times I find it difficult to put it on even though I'm not an ectomorph and shouldn't have any trouble. Like, literally, there is a guy I know who only lifts weights when he dies on his xbox game. Literally puts the controller down, does about 5 bicep curls, and then that's it. His muscle is almost on par with mine and I've been working out vigorously for 8 months.

Is my complete lack of Vitamin D contributing to my lack of muscle growth and weakness? If that's the case I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and discuss it, because I really just wan't to be able to feel good about myself and not be stuck in this permanent hole of feeling weak and not energetic. It feels like the right workout advice applies to everyone but me, and it's making me lose motivation to keep going to the gym.

Long post I know, sorry. If anyone can reply and help me out you'd be doing my life a massive favour. Thanks"
778,Lymphoma Scare,"Greetings,

I am worried I am showing symptoms of some variety of lymphoma. I have an upcoming appointment with my GP, but I’m nervous and I’ve entered the boy who cried wolf territory with my fiancé. 



History first:

I am a 29 year Caucasian male in the United States. I have good health insurance through my job teaching. 


My first symptoms go all the way back to last year. I had an infection that landed me in the hospital. Doctors cured it up but I was stuck there for a day and a half and required some heavy antibiotics. They were afraid to let me leave as my heart rate refused to drop below 100 bpm but eventually yielded. My bpm has been around this level all year.


In April I developed a cough. It was mild, and dry. I thought nothing of it. As a teacher I get coughs often because kids are gross. This cough stayed with me and I still have it. I’ve been to my GP, two ENTs, a cardiologist and a pulmonologist for this. I’ve been on a variety of inhalers (aidvair, spirivia, Flovent), prednisone, singular, and pentaprozol, none of which have made a difference. I did a test that involved breathing into a machine in a bunch of different ways which came back with good results, and did a chest X-ray and ct scan both of which showed nothing. The ct scan did pick up some liquid around my heart which sent me to the cardiologist. He did an echo and found nothing of note. 


The first ENT was very old and not helpful. I started seeing the new one this week and he scheduled me for a neck ct scan with contrast for two weeks from now. He is just being cautious but he suspected it involved something with an irritated nerve. 


Around June I started getting daily prolonged headaches. I went to a neurologist who had me take a eeg, and get an mri. The mri picked up a 1cm lesion and he referred me to a neuro-oncologist. I’ve been with Sloan Kettering for about four months now. They’ve conducted a follow up mri this month and it showed no changes. Another is due in December. The lesion is something they couldn’t identify and were scared to operate on as it was near something that controlled my vision. They said it could be nothing or something that I wouldn’t know about for years. A headache specialist (another neurologist) prescribed me amitriptyline which cured the headaches after about two weeks. 


The new and scary symptoms started this week. On Monday my fiancé noticed the lymph node near my jaw/neck on the left side was swollen. It did not hurt but was larger than usual. Shortly after that I started itching all over my body. I don’t know if this is related or because I googled lymphoma and my body reacted to what it found out. I have been seeing a therapist for this. Additionally my body temperature has been between 99.3-100.4 every evening for the last week. I’ve also lost about four - five pounds since Monday, and while I have been doing cardio my diet hasn’t exactly been great this week due to Halloween. I can’t say I’ve experienced night sweats that are unusual - I sweat a little bit but not swimming pools of it. My fiancé thinks it is just a little cold but I’m not seeing it. I don’t know if I should wait for this ct scan that isn’t for two weeks or if I should go to the hospital. 

Thank you!"
779,nausea feeling constantly for no reason for 12~ years,"so im 22 right now, lets throw this story all the way back at maybe 4th grade. so about 12 years ago. ever since i could remember since then ive felt nauseas constantly for no reason. when i was about 10 all i can remember is throwing up in a sink red liquid(which might have been from a drink) but ever since then i think ive had a fear of vomitting. but i think it progressed to even more. 

&#x200B;

since then i havent been able to eat out at places because i just feel sick to my stomach if i do, i cant wear clothing thats tight on my neck or near it because again it'll start making me gag easily. i remember going to the hospital as a kid and they were going to do an xray in my stomach but i hadnt ate that morning so they tried making me drink something to check but even then i couldnt drink something. my parents told me i was taking medication and an almost yogurt tasting drink like a danimal for it but ive still felt bad ever since. 

&#x200B;

im unable to go to crowded places such as movies, parties, or anywhere with loud banging noises like clubs because even that just makes me feel nauseous. i was diagnosed with social anxiety during highschool so about 16 years old maybe, which that was an issue of me having to urinate frequently and again with the crowded spaces. but i never thought about that maybe being anxiety since most of the nauseousness was always with me since i was a little kid. i have been reading stuff up recently and people say they have the same syptoms as me and that it could be something like gastroparesis but you know the internet you can never know. 

&#x200B;

im just curious if any doctor has heard of something like this or what i might try to be able to narrow it down to help my doctor if i do end up deciding if its more of a therapist issue or an actual doctor issue."
