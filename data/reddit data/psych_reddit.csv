0,[x-post]Is it possible for a treatment resistant psychotic disorder with mood component to be misdiagnosed PTSD ?,
1,Do I have psychosis?,"I see a lot of hallucinations that look are either shapes or color globs and occasionally rings, I also think my
Friends are talking shit about me everytime I smoke with them. I never hear voices though or have these feelings while sober other than hallucinations."
2,Do mood stabilizers work for unipolar depressed patients?,"Asking because I'm on a mood stabilizer (lamotrigine) and don't have a bipolar diagnosis, but it works perfectly for me."
3,Is it possible to induce schizophrenia?,"Or in other words, can human induce schizophrenia to other human?If yes, how?

The only info I have is that non-chronic psychosis can be induced by drugs. What about schizophrenia? Can be caused by drugs as well?"
4,Would anyone be willing to pm me?,"I have a very long string of messages of me essentially pouring out my brain with everything I am having problems with at the moment. I pretty much got obsessed with thinking I might be a psycho/sociopath or narc. Then I got obsessed with autism. Honestly it’s just my empathy which really trips me.

Anyway if you are willing to give me feedback on a very detailed and long account of me, pm me."
5,Zoloft/Wellbutrin edgy feeling,"I have been on 50mg Zoloft for depression for 6 months and it is great. It really mellowed out my erratic moods. Recently I started feeling anxious from time to time, the sweating side effects were starting to make me uncomfortable and I really had a lack of motivation (I think this was making me anxious) I addressed the issues with my doctor and we decided to try adding 150mg Wellbutrin XL. I’m currently on day 4. I can tell it has already helped with the motivation, and I am not as overheated all the time. But I do feel a level of edgy ness. Not necessarily BAD edgy, but I am way more self aware of my emotions, and more likely to speak on them. (I have had a few blow ups with my hubby, they weren’t petty fights. They were deep conversations with big breakthroughs) With the Zoloft it was more of a no fucks given feeling. Which was such a nice break from being so easily triggered my whole life previously. My question is, can my awareness of my emotions and acting on them be therapeutic? I have spent my whole life angry, and had a lot of anger issues so when I would react it would be in a very unhealthy way. Now I feel that same amount of emotion, but my brain does speak out on the emotions differently. I’m going to be honest, I have a lot of childhood trauma I am still working on with my therapist, but it is a process. I have just had a few enlightening moments where some things clicked in my head about my past, and i feel like the Wellbutrin almost helps my brain go to that place? I guess I’m nervous because I enjoyed the blunted feeling on the Zoloft, but I would really like to FEEL my emotions. Also, does the edgy ness wear over time? It is the only side effect that I am feeling, and maybe I need to just be patient for the anti-depressant side to build in my body? 

I have already left a message with my doctor about this issue, but I believe he is out of the office until Monday, and I have a sense of curiosity, not urgency."
6,Lithium (1200) and Lamotrigine (25).,"My Lithium is up to 1200mg (not sure blood level). 

My Lamotrigine is at 25mg (starting dose). 

I was depressed, and I bumped up the Li to 1200. My mood improved right away. I wanted to wait a few days to try to gauge the Li's effects *before* I muddied the waters with Lamotrigine. 

I felt so spacey for a few days. No idea which drug caused it. I felt bizarre, though not really depressed. Very ""out of it,"" distant...my memory/identity both felt distant. 

I had *awful* ""twitches"" that weren't nearly as bad as akathisia, but still pretty brutal. 

Then one day I woke up feeling less weird/terrible, with brighter mood/energy, and with not very many twitches. The twitches seem to be on the way to zero, which is great. 

I think that the Lamotrigine might be kicking in. I have no idea for sure, but it's interesting. 

Lamotrigine seems to have a major effect. Last time I took it (at the lowest dose) I became manic within like one day or two days, but that was a totally different context (had just been manic, was MEGA-depressed, no Li) so probably not useful information. 

Lamotrigine is a fascinating medication. We intend to ratchet up to 200, over some months, but if it already has an effect at 25 then that seems like too much, unless the initial effect is much more than the effect after each increase. 

Is it normal for Lamotrigine to have an effect at 25mg, given that we're headed for 200mg in the long run? (I suppose that we might stop if I feel too elevated, or something. Not sure how we will gauge when to stop.) 

What do you guys think of the medication? It's a pretty awesome medication in my view. Putting aside the (very small) risk of rash, it seems like an awesome medication because it doesn't have all the terrible side-effects of other medications, and it seems just as powerful as the other ones.

**Edit**: How often can a Lithium/Lamotrigine combo actually balance out bipolar patients' mood in a way that *sticks*? And what do you do if it works for like a year and then messes up? What adjustments do you make? I'm curious about the long-term situation for patients on these two meds that I'm on. It *seems* like a hopeful combo."
7,How long can 'normal' periods last in bipolar disorder?,"I (21F) was diagnosed with BP1 when I was 18, and have received that same diagnosis a few times by different professionals over the years. I have had 2 hospitalizations and was on medication for 3 years.

I went off latuda in June (under supervision and with permission) and I've been doing great since going off. I've only dealt with minor anxiety and I'm able to hold down a job for the first time in forever. 

I was just wondering, how long can normal periods in between episodes last? I've been questioning whether or not I have bipolar disorder, due to an absence of symptoms.

Edit: Also, I've never had alcohol, never smoked weed, never had recreational drugs. 5'2. Went from 108pnds to 174pnds after taking zyprexa, and I'm currently 157 pounds."
8,Anything but Depakote - rapid cycling bipolar disorder,"28 yrs, F, 4' 11"", 103 lb, Asian, bipolar disorder II 5 yrs

psychiatric diagnosis: bipolar disorder II; current meds: 400 mg lamotrigine, 120 mg lurasidone, tapering off carbamazepine

I cycle rapidly. Episodes have always lasted from 5 days - 2 weeks. Lamotrigine and lurasidone work well, but in the past we added carbamazepine because they clearly weren't enough. Carbamazepine worked wonderfully - except during the change in seasons. Each fall and spring, cycles become so tight and intense that at times it's been impossible to work - mainly due to intense cognitive impairment during the depressive episodes. This year, the suicidal ideation returned. My psychiatrist has suggested that we switch to Depakote, or some other form of valproic acid, given the evidence behind its utility for rapid cycling bipolar disorder.

I've read the studies, I know about the breathtaking amount of weight gain. I know it doesn't happen to everyone, but if studies show that \~70% of females gain \~10 lbs in six months, my chances aren't great. My family has a terrible cardiac history: My dad had a cardiac arrest at 49 yrs, my uncle and grandfather had triple bypasses, my brother had the highest cholesterol level ever recorded in the doctor's office. All first degree relatives have high cholesterol - as do I now. No one in my family is obese, drinks alcohol, smokes or does drugs. It's genetic. Starting a medication that will make me gain a significant amount of weight is insane.

Are there other options for rapid cycling bipolar disorder? My psychiatrist seems set on the Depakote. Low dose lithium (I am rarely hypomanic) didn't work and gave me migraines, though I would be willing to give it a second trial. I had a bad reaction to bupropion, so that's a no-go (prescribed before bipolar diagnosis). I'm feeling pretty desperate and depressed about this situation. Sometimes it feels like I'm just being forced to choose how to die."
9,Questioning Bipolar Diagnosis,
10,"Going to see a doctor tomorrow about my ongoing psychosis, what do you think he will do to me?"," I'm scared. Have an ongoing psychosis for 2 years now due to LSD. It was bad but managable, I only saw stuff in the corner of my eyes at night, would sleep with the lights on. Thats it.  
Stupid me didnt stop taking LSD.  
Yesterday had a psychotic trip again. If it werent for 2mg xanax I would prob kill myself. Today everything was fine until night came and I started feeling terror again, took my last 0.5mg of xanax and while I still feel fear its not that intense, altought I wish I had more xanax.  
Tomorrow I have to go to hospital because I dont think I will live trough the night tomorrow without any xanax.  
What do you think doctors will do to me? Will they have me stay there or will they just give me meds?  
Any advice is helpful because I'm really scared. Thanks.   
 I'm just afraid of everything and seem to be in a constant panick attack. But at night, it gets 100x intense, hallucinations start, I see a monster in my imagination. I see it for the past couple of months. But yesterday, it felt as if it emerged from me and now I'm consious of it on a whole new level."
11,Working with psychopaths.,Do female psychiatrists treat psychopaths?
12,Drug-induced Psychosis or Schizophrenia,"I took three months 0,5g magic mushrooms and 100mg modafinil per day. Afterwards I took four months 100mg modafinil per day.

My psychotic symptoms started around the fourth month. I thought the professors at uni talked about me. Later on I saw shadows in my peripheral vision. At the end I went full blown psychosis with realistic hallucinations and strong delusions.

I had to be admitted to the psych ward and stop the modafinil. All my delusions subsided after they gave me haldol. It took me four days. After three weeks I had a delusion again for about 15 minutes. Now I’m six months symptom free and on 2mg risperidone.

They diagnosed me with Intoxication-Psychosis and also maybe paranoide schizophrenia. They were not sure. I read that it’s extremely rare to get a psychosis from modafinil. How can I find out, if it’s schizophrenia or not? They reduce my risperidone after three months of taking it, but it’s probably not the best choice, if I have schizophrenia. Why they gave me risperidone for three months and not one year?"
13,How to lose a diagnosis,"Hey all,

I was diagnosed with bipolar ii, ADHD, and a eating disorder from a psychiatrist about 2 years ago but I don't think they're accurate. What steps can I take to get this undone? I called the most recent nurse practitioner who I was seeing and she said she wasn't willing to as she wasn't taking on any new patients. 

I don't know if it's possible but I think the medication was having an adverse reaction since once I stopped taking them I felt so much better. 

If anyone can help me with the appropriate steps that would be greatly appreciated."
14,Why does Neurotonin reduce the amount of Alprazolam taken?,"Long story short, I've been RX'd Alprazolam for anxiety for years and recently started Neurontin for pain. Since I started taking Neurontin I noticed I don't reach for my 'as needed' script for the anxiety meds nearly as much. After sharing this with my doctor he upped the pain med dose and reduced the amount of Alprazolam for me to take. I'm perfectly fine with this, less anxiety is always good and he said Neurontin isn't nearly as addictive as the other one, it's been hard to get new doctors to prescribe Xanax due to abuse potential so I'm all for it.

Why does this work though? Only Benzos have had any effect on my anxiety, and now this med that isn't even meant to be used as an anxiolytic just happens to work so well my benzo usage reduced by 50% without noticing. I'm amazed, I'd even say it helps more with my anxiety than pain at this point."
15,Helppp,"Anyone who had problems with existential ocd or psychosis, help me!

Going to try to make it as short as possible. So I have had anxiety for a year now + dpdr and ocd. I have had simular thoughts about this kind of theme(existential). So long story short I got a thought about dimensions and that somehow I got stuck in a different one.At first I got anxious but I got over it even though it felt real. About a week ago, my parents got into a fight which trigerred my ocd dimensions thoughts. And so I sometimes get anxious about being stuck in a different dimension, even though I know its not real and its impossible but it feels really real and idk why cant I get over it again. So I went to a psychologists today and he said that I might be developing psychosis. And I freaked out. Has anyone had any similar experiences?"
16,Seasonal OCD becoming more severe every year?,"To preface I’m a 19 year old male, and and as title suggests, I started noticing it around 3 years ago, but this year it has really started to impact my quality of life, whether it be by washing my hands and avoiding certain contact during the day, or routines at night before bed and in the morning before I leave to make sure the house doesn’t burn down, I just can’t escape the thoughts and feelings associated unless I act out the routines, I’m aware that’s bad for it but the repercussions if I don’t truly are worse for hours or all day. 

My mother displayed pretty severe OCD year round from what I remember, she would wash her hands so much they would bleed, or check oven knobs and doors at least 10 times (not exaggerating), I was later adopted out of that family LOL.

My main question is, what would someone in my position, without insurance, making 12/hr do to get professional help, or should I even? Mental health is usually considered last when it comes to health issues especially where I am from so getting treatment seems like a reach but I truly don’t know, never had any form of it."
17,No antipsychotic for schizoaffective?,"No antipsychotic?

My PA I am seeing wants to take me off my antipsychotic (seroquel) and put me on a mood stabilizer (depakote). He says he really wants to get rid of my hallucinations for me and make me entirely asymptomatic. Hes excited to have a schizoaffective client and thinks that this is, what he said, “the gold standard for this disorder.”

Im not so sure. I mean, I dont really get how my psychotic symptoms are supposed to get better by taking me off the antipsychotic. But Im not the clinician here so idk. He said if this doesnt work we will try lithium, but he would prefer not to have to do that.

My mood is relatively stable. Has been for a month, but I had some issues in September (adjustment, moved back home and stress messed with me, Im weak), so thats not a SUPER immediate need, but I suppose I can understand a mood stabilizer because my mood can be problematic over time. 

I was taking 600mgs. I saw him the middle of October and he cut it down to 450 and then when comfortable go to 300. Ive done 300 for 2 days now and I feel really... spacy? I guess is the right word. Like I cannot focus well because everything seems kind of mildly “wrong/distorted”. But I am trying not to be a huge baby about it and deal.

Now today he said to start taking 150mgs and Im a little worried about doing this. I havent hallucinated in a few days but I already feel kinda crappy from the 300mgs. He said that by the next appointment, November 20th, hed like to see me off the seroquel and on depakote.

I just dont know if this is right. I get that this is super specific and I dont expect... I dont really know what I expect, and I dont want to cross any lines here and cause any problems, but I would also prefer not to end up in a hospital, or having the next few months be a waking nightmare from being on something “wrong”. I dont want to mess everything up.

But if depakote really is better, I dont know. Im not the med provider here. 

Is this common? Only using a mood stabilizer for schizoaffective?"
18,I don't know how to get myself on the right meds. My fear and paranoia won't stop. I'm suppose to start seroquel. Can someone please reassure me that 12.5 mg of Seroquel will help me even though I'm hypersensitive to meds? I'm having severe anxiety/ panic attacks and severe paranoia.,"I'm having numbness in my forehead, increased ringing in my ears every other day and extreme paranoia along with severe anxiety and panic attacks.  I couldn't sleep and I have the chills right now.  I'm scared to take these meds.  I'm taking 1 mg of ativan but I don't wanna take it anymore even though its the only thing that's calmed me. But I get paranoid its causing or increasing my paranoia.  I've taken it for 2 years I got this bad 3 months ago. My dr doesn't think its causing this.   I have a phobia of psych meds.  I need help getting over it. What do I do? I don't wanna end up a vegetable. I can't end up a vegetable right? I was inpatient for a day and couldn't handle it. I was too scared.   My dr is upset and said If I don't take my meds he won't see me. He wanted me to stay inpatient to help me but I freaked out. How do you help ppl like me that's terrified? I have medication induced panic attacks. I've been feeling out of touch.  It comes and goes.  I felt better yesterday and then all of a sudden a wave hit me and I was experiencing extreme fear and paranoia that it wiped me out. I had to go home to bed.  Some days I feel like things look out of it."
19,Mental illness and loneliness,
20,"Dot-Based, Blurred, Colorful Vision","Hey!

Since I know myself, I see the world as parts of dot, or particles, and color always shifting at the background, like none of them is actually real. 

My psychiatrists and eye doctors assure me that nothing wrong with me biologically. 

But I'm still concerned. They are not visual illusions per say or hallucinations, I just see the world not a concrete but moving, particle based phenemomome with colours constantly moving. 

It's not getting worse when I am stressful or on drugs etc. Always the same. 

Any idea why this is happening?

I began to fear from MS. Is it a possibility since I have a fibromyalgia and ADHD too.  

Bests,"
21,Advice on How to Stop Seeing my Psychiatrist / Lying To Psychiatrists,"This probably sounds simple, but I do have a few questions that are keeping me from just canceling. I've been seeing this person voluntarily for meds since August of this year, but I haven't taken meds since April of this year. 

It's been a long ineffective process with medication and therapy, and I got fed up and stopped my meds in April. I've been feeling mostly better, but never worse. 

I'm 20 and my parent's want me to see someone so I kept meeting with him. But he wants me to get my Lithium levels checked and...I really don't want to start taking them for a few weeks to then get blood work done and then stop again. It'll fuck up those weeks pretty badly, along with how sick they make me the first day or two taking Lithium. 

So, I want to just say I'm done and cancel without him alerting and worrying my parents. Even though I'm 20 I've allowed them to be able to call and ask for info. I don't think they have ever done so, but it's more of a comforting thing for them since I rarely bring up issues. 

So, would my psychiatrist alert my parents about this? How would he react if a patient he thinks is on meds suddenly says they won't be coming anymore? The place also offers therapy, could I email him and ask to move me into that program without causing issues if I'm honest?

My next meeting with him is December 15th, so I have time I guess but I need to make a decision sooner than later."
22,Why have I started hearing my name in different scenarios?,"Along with getting mega obsessed with sociopathy, autism, adhd, psychopathy, and narcassism, causing me to non stop think about how something might be wrong with me, for the pas couple of weeks once a week I will experience a voice saying my name.

For instance one night I cried for the first time in a while about something and then just as I was about to go to sleep I heard a harsh voice but I don’t know what it said. It wasn’t like I heard it in the room it was just in my head.

When I was a. A festival in the summer I was conscious that every now and then walking through crowds I would hear my name from a random voice. 

In the past month, it was happened twice over two weeks where I have been masturbating one time where I heard an unknown voice whispering my name, and another time where I think I was daydreaming at s hook and in my head, not in the room I heard a bold voice saying my name.

This has never happened before what is going on? I have been seein a counselor about the stuff I mentioned at he start and he decided he doubted I was a sociopath or anything but after a second session said I could see a psychiatrist about testing for autism."
23,Is there such a thing as “quiet” Borderline Personal Disorder?,"Is there such a thing as “quiet” Borderline personality disorder? In which some of the symptoms such as anger and extreme emotional outbursts are directed inward as opposed to the acting out in classic form? I definitely appear higher functioning or normal from the outside (coworkers, casual friends & acquaintances) but my emotional instability becomes much more apparent whenever I let people get to close , in romantic relationships (which I seem to avoid now)  or during stressful life circumstances? 

I was diagnosed with high functioning or “quiet” BPD 6 years ago which seems to fit perfectly. However, I recently I started seeing a therapist again after a few years of not going. This new therapist said it’s not BPD but Complex PTSD. She acknowledged it’s not officially in the DSM but said that it’s very similar to BPD but is not as extreme as the classic acting out BPD. She cited the ACE study and the book “The Body Keeps score” 
She said complex trauma is caused by ongoing childhood trauma and attachment with caregivers. 

My mother had flashbacks almost immediately after I was born of her father molesting her for years as a child. She took it out on me from the start. She would rage at me for hours by screaming, name calling and violence including the metal part of a belt to the face. She then would feel guilty and buy me whatever I wanted. Then she would go into a violent rage again. My father worked all day & didn’t know the extent of what was going on I loved my dad but my mother decided she needed to be single after a breakdown. My dad is emotionally distance and unfortunately started a new family when I was 8. He paid child support & sent me to private schools but I only got 2 phone calls a year and the occasional visit. It was clear I was a visitor and nothing more. 

My mother ended up taking me around her father who had molested her as a child when we moved back from Boston when I was 4. She cut off all contact with him when I was 8 years old. I was drawing sexual pictures and had an interest in sex by age 5 or 6. Although I have no memory of any sexual abuse. 

My mother never got well. I’m in my late 20s now and I’ve only ever seemed to be interested in men who have no interest in commitment, use me for sex or are closet still partying hard well into their 30s. Their rejection hurts so bad it feels like a panic attack even though on some level I know it’s coming. I hide it ok at times but I hate adult responsibility and still feel emotionally very young. I want children someday but am terrified of becoming my mother. 

I do want to beat my demons and am pretty insightful. I just want to make sure I get the correct diagnosis. 

How do I know which therapist is correct? Is there a good test?"
24,SSRIs make me overthink - Stimulants calm it down?,"So I’ve had an issue with overthinking/over analyzing things to the point that I would lose sleep and don’t even feel present in life. The symptoms matched low serotonin so I was prescribed an SSRI (viibryd) and a few weeks into it the overthinking analyzing is even more now.. then the other day I used adderall for studying and all the sudden I notice the thoughts all stopped and this happened each time I used it.. I thought it was strange that a stimulant would calm it down. 

Is this a typical ADD response or something else? Why would more dopamine cause me to have less of these overthinking/over analyzing states of mind and more serotonin make it worse?"
25,Question question.,"Hello everyone, I have a quick question, how you can know when your dopamine it’s going down or up?"
26,When does sedation from TCAs start to subside specifically Doxepin?,"Just a general question when going over some information for my students. 

I know that Doxepin has the strongest inhibiting of histamine H1 receptors but when do we start seeing (if) Doxepin to decrease in sedation? 

Thank you"
27,irritating deprivation of ssnri,"I've been using cymbalta (since november 2018) until 2 weeks ago, started with 30mg and after 1 week I went for 60mg. it was prescribed. about 2 weeks ago I've went to another psychiatrist because I wanted to quit those. she got me started on something called duxalta on 30mg, said it was equivalent to cymbalta. I was supposed to take those for 3 months or so before quitting.

tho  I've really disliked the affects of it. after 2 weeks, I've decided to quit them by my own. now I know this is really irresponsible but the affects of it were really unpleasant and extremely hard to describe. it was like time slowed down for a few seconds and nothing made any sense during that time. sometimes it was triggered when I'm listening to someone and they started sound really really dumb. but once it triggered by two cars honking at each other. the affect were the same tho. time slowed down and nothing made any sense and people appeared to be acting incredibly stupid.anyway, thats why I've decided to quit my own because I feel like this all not gonna make any sense to a psychiatrist or anyone else tbh. didnt want to try another drug at all.

it been 3 days and I feel really awful. not depressed or anything but my head is so dizzy, I feel so cold all the time, getting stomach aches and kinda anxious. there's this ringing noise in my head as well. wasnt able to sleep till 5 am last night. and tbh there's this low-key hallucinations time to time. nothing discrete, but lights or shadows moving in my vision for half of a second or something. I'm looking for any advice on my situation, if it's gonna last another couple of days, I'm actually willing to bear it in order to being able to quit them for good. but if it's going to last for a week or something I dont think I'll be handling this any smoothly.

I dont consume any alcohol, tho I smoke weed regularly, usually it helps for deprivation of antidepressants but I dont have money to buy some atm. are there anything I could do by my own?

edit;  I just read some articles that said this symptoms can last up to months. this got me really scared about my situation. I'm considering taking some lsd because I've heard about they both affect the same part of the brain. anyone got any experience on that? also what happens if I break those pills apart and snort a very little portions of it, would that easy those symptoms?"
28,Psychedelics and depression/anxiety.,"I know there are studies that we can refer to, but I’m wondering more about the professionals’ “gut” feelings about the possible effects of psychedelics on depression/anxiety and the future of such treatment. 

With your knowledge, does it make sense that a sort of ego death might greatly improve mood? 

If deregulation allows further study and use of psychedelics in medicine (and pretending there is no political or big business opposition), do you see this resulting in a complete overhaul in how we treat these disorders, a niche treatment, or something inconsequential?"
29,Would I be put into a straight jacket?,"Hello, I am starting to go see a psychologist but I am afraid to say some stuff due to fear of being locked up.           

Basically I lack empathy in most situations, I look for weakness in people to try to exploit for my gain(I work in sales. I was involved in  the bdsm lifestyle and still have interests. If it matters, I was a submissive. In yr 12 about 20 years ago I was super stressed with school and had thoughts of killing my father but I think that could also be because he cheated on my mother but not sure.          

Apart from normal porn, bdsm porn, I find some scenes in hostel(the bath scene) to be erotic. 

I am currently seeing a psychologist for ocd but I only get a few lessons paid for as it’s through work and he can’t see me outside of it due to contract.           

Anyway, he said I come ofc as a down to earth friendly person.          


I don’t torture animals, I am against violence to children. I am not violent or sadistic. I know right from wrong except for emotions.          

So will I be locked up?"
30,35M - Unable to form relationships/fear of rejection,"I'm a 35-year-old male who has never been in a relationship. I have never been on a date. I have anxiety when talking to people in general, women in particular. In scenarios where I have to talk to a woman I don't know, I'll have a physical reaction, like my throat constricting, my face reddening, etc. I've been like this for as long as I can remember. I have an incredible fear of rejection by women. I have a feeling that my body reacting the way it does is to protect me from getting into a situation where I might be rejected by a woman. Recently I had an unusual experience that seemed to trigger bad memories and maybe give me some insight to my issues. 

For some background, my parents divorced when I was 6 or 7 years old. My father got custody of my older brother and me, as my mother was out of work at the time. My mother soon got a job overseas and moved away (this was the early 90s, leaving the country was much more of a separation than it is today). My brother and I would see our mother a few times each year, usually during holidays or summer. Eventually when I was in high school (late 90s), my mother moved back to the states, relatively close to where I lived. 

A week or so ago I began reading a novel that triggered an emotional crisis. In the novel there are two brothers who are left by their mother, who then leaves the country. In the book, the brothers hated their mother for abandoning them (I don't hate my mother and am actually pretty close to her today). Given my background, I was profoundly moved by the novel and had a realization that many of the social problems I was experiencing were probably connected to my mother leaving me. As hard as it may be to believe, I had never connected my mother's leaving with my fear of rejection until I read this book. I'd always thought there was something about me that was maybe repellant and unlovable, which I'm now starting to question. 

Since I've had this realization, instead of feeling better, I've felt overwhelmed with emotions. Yesterday, leaving work, I felt heaviness in my chest and breathed heavily. This carried over through today. Now I just don't know what to do. Do I see a therapist? Is it possible to resolve this on my own, now that I think I know why I feel this way?"
31,First time to a psychiatrist. Made two appts with two different psychs. Do I disclose this?,"Is this okay, to see multiple psychiatrists at the beginning to find a good fit? Do I disclose this? I have an appt next week and if it goes okay I’ll just cancel the other appt. I have a really good relationship with my PCP but it’s time to see a specialist, I’ve been on too many meds, I’m getting tired of only having 15 minutes to follow up, and I only want to continue seeing my PCP for regular visits. I guess I’m just wondering if it’s frowned upon or if I’ll get in trouble for seeing multiple doctors. Obviously I only plan on continuing on with one...."
32,Best way to get off outpatient commitment after inpatient and doctor switch?,"I just got approved for Medicaid qmb so I can see a mindfulness therapist! I'm looking forward to this, however I was on medicare in an outpatient clinic where my dad would come to the appointment with me and basically hold sway over my truth^tm.  
Now I'll be looking for a doctor to help me reduce medicine and hopefully get off outpatient commitment, it's already been 7 months.
Any red flags I should avoid when looking?

Also I have an orbiting care coordinator that may try and dictate my options since I'm committed right now. I've been on injection since I was taken in to the hospital.  Was off it before for 10 months but family doesn't like who I am without meds, I want my life back under my control and I'm tired of feeling foggy and forgetful when I can be joyful, creative and witty.

Any help is appreciated."
33,Grown in abusive family,"Hello everyone. I was grown up in shithole neighbourhood not in US. People were involved in drug, prostitutions, gambling, fighting, etc etc. My family was uneducated and abusive(I am not angry with them). They never let me go out other than school (because of bad neighbourhood). Now, I am in US studying. I have a hard time socializing. I enjoy myself being alone, laying on bed alone, playing game alone,etc. But I feel like it is not way to live life. I like to hang with my friends, but hanging with makes me feel more lonely. I try to join their group for conversation but IDK why cannot go along with them. I feel more lonley with them in parties. I feel like I need some therapy. What specfic therapist should I visit? I tried to get in comfort I just cannot.  Is this right sub to post this thread?"

35,[27M] Caught between a rock and a hard place with Adderall Rx & Depression,"Hello. I've never actually spoken or seen a psychiatrist before so this is a new thing for me. I saw a few other similar questions on this subreddit but nothing specifically answered my concern so I thought I'd post it here. 

A little about me: 6'1"", ~170lbs. No real history of mental health issues besides ADD. I smoke weed occasionally, maybe a couple puffs once a week. Don't really drink alcohol. Smoke a vape frequently & chew nicotine gum. Currently prescribed 20mg of Adderall XR, taking usually ~30-60mg a day with 2-3 off days a week and occasional week long breaks when I run out. I've been progressively abusing it over ~2 years. Days I don't take it are usually pretty rough, I'm definitely dependent. I have some 20mg IR's that I sometimes take a half dose of when I need the extra boost too. Sometimes I'll take 2-3 antacids (Tums) to increase the solubility of the Adderall. Sometimes I'll take 200mg of caffeine (pill) too. Feel free to tear into me for that + nicotine, I probably need to hear it & my heart would thank you. 

I very rarely take more than 60mg in a day, however I have taken ~100mg over 24 hours a handful of times (not within the past year). My GP is partly aware of my abuse - I've told them that I take 30mg daily, am dependent on it, & have breaks on the weekends. To my surprise, they said they'd prescribe me 30mg (I was expecting them to cut me off) but I declined knowing it would probably only lead to me abusing a higher dosage. 30mg is truthfully my minimum, unless I don't take it; my typical dose is about 40mg spaced out through the day. Sleep hygine is pretty poor - probably get about 4 or 5 hours a night, however it's pretty sporadic. Some nights I'll get 1 hour, others I'll get 9. I try to make up for some lost sleep when I can by sleeping 12+ hours every so often, usually on days I don't take my meds. My Adderall dosage and amount of sleep I get per night are definitely related, though I'm not sure if it's because of the Adderall or work I have to get done. Probably both. 

Ok, sorry about all that - the reason I'm here: I think I'm reaching a level of depression where I need to talk to a psychiatrist. I'm a current grad student and the stress from school and all these other responsibilities are taking a toll on my mental health. I've additionally noticed a progression of anxiety that is commonly exacerbated by the adderall. Others have noticed as well. Physical health also seems to be on a slow decline. My problem is my devotion to school. I want my degree so badly it's almost an obsession; failure in this, in my mind, would result in a complete and total collapse of my self identity. I wouldn't go as far as saying life wouldn't be worth living if it happened, but I think it would certainly be a crisis for me. If I fail a single class I'm kicked out of the program - it's just the college's policy for grad students. If I stop taking Adderall I'll fail. I'm too dang dependent. I know there are laws and policies in place to protect me but I can't seem to put my trust in them against tenured professors. I've heard a lot of horror stories in academia about these sort of things. 

So. If I see a psychiatrist for my depression, the Adderall problem IS something I would like to share with them in its entirety. With that said, if they take me off of it completely and I fail my classes because of it, I will probably become very self-destructive (not suicidal). This is almost like a self inflicted consequence I've intentionally planted and reinforced in my mind to discourage me from failing. I'm not sure how fucked up that is, but my guess is at least moderately to very. Anyway, what would you do if you were in my shoes and had never seen a psychiatrist before? Should I be honest straight away or maybe tell them at the end of the semester when I have a break? I'm also going to run out soon of Adderall soon and have no way of getting more. School is picking up and without it I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to function well enough to get by. Is this something I need to tell them too? Could they help me with that problem too or is it a consequence of my addiction that I'll have to bear? 

Thank you very much for any advice, and sorry about the length of the post. (Adderall, but I probably didn't need to tell y'all that.) Sincerely though, thank you - it's something I'm genuinely concerned about and I'm unsure of which road I need to be traveling right now."
36,Please help: is Effexor making me stupid,"So a little backstory: I’ve been on a lot of antidepressants, low doses (I’m a small person), for depression and social anxiety. I get really freaky about them and always get convinced that they’re changing my personality and making me boring/zombie like. My psychiatrist says it’s my anxiety doing that. Might be, I really don’t know. Maybe placebo, but i really do believe it. 
Anyways, I started effexor er 37.5 about 6 months ago after I realized I needed to be on and stay on antidepressants. For the first time, a medication actually worked for me. It was great in the beginning. Really helped me get my shit together. But from the start I noticed some slight memory issues and felt a little dumber/spacey/just not fully in tune with the world and not as sharp, u get the point. But it was minor and worth the trade off for sure. Then I upped my dose to 75 after about 3 months, but it made me quite lethargic and I felt it was unnecessary anyways so I bumped it back down to 37.5. 
Now, I’m getting more depressed again, probably building a tolerance, but feel the same amount if not more mental fog! Wtf! This makes no sense to me, i can’t think of any outside factors that would cause this. I quit smoking weed a week or two ago and have been taking omega 3 supplements for about a month, along with working out the past 2 months pretty consistently. I eat moderately healthy. If anything, I should be sharper. SO, could it be the meds? Am I just looking for something to blame my stupidity on? They also make my eyes harder to focus and it makes me feel fucking high all the time."
37,Neurosteroids/Hormones & Psychological/Neurological Issues," 

Hello sirs, I can't seem to find anyone knowkedgable on the topic.

I've had hppd(hallucinogen persisting percetion disorder)/ visual snow syndrome. The pathlogy is similar(the same) in the brain, however one is drug induced. It is a Neurological(hyper activity in thr lingual gyru) issue that causes a psychological issue (panic disorder)

I'm currently self expierementing with hormone therapy and neurosteroids in hopes to find symptom relief. Its not so much the symptoms that bother me, its the anxiety it causes and the overstimulation due to it. I am curious as to the effects of testosterone, estrodial, dht etcs effects on certain neurotransmitters. I have been on paxil for 10 years (10mg) and since starting test, I've noticed its almost nullified the effect of paxil, I believe this is due to the increase in SERT, which negates the effect of inhibiting the transporters. I do not mind this effect however I am feeling more anxious and am curious of the effects of these hormones on glutamate, aspartate, and gaba as those seem to be primary instigators of the hyper sensitivity and anxiety caused by thie terrible diesease.

I have began injecting testosterone and dht and supplementing with pregnenolone.

Any studies/links to topics in these regards are much appreciated."
38,Anyone else noticed this haircut trend amongst psychotic patients?,"I’m a board certified psych RN with 7 years experience with acute psych inpatient (along with CD/rehab) and have seen this dozens of times over the years. 

I’ve noticed many psychotic patients either presenting to the hospital with this haircut or cutting it themselves with a razor during supervised shaving. 

These patients cut/shave the sides of their hair in front of and/or around both ears. They don’t bother with whatever’s happening up top, they only seem concerned about this area. 

I’ve noted in numerous times and no other coworkers seem to have noticed the trend. 

I’m wondering if it has to do with auditory hallucinations or tactile disturbance from the hair around their ears. 

I’ve never thought to ask this in a subreddit and just read another post about a biomarker for schizophrenia in human hair that made me think to ask.  

I can’t for the life of me google a picture of what I’m talking about but will keep looking. Anyone ever notice this?"
39,Zoloft and appetite suppression,"I have been on 50mg of Zoloft for about 6 months now. It has been life changing! But I have noticed it is super hard for me to eat. I was expecting the weight gain (which I welcomed, if it helped my anxiety) But honestly it has been the opposite. I have only lost a few pounds, nothing crazy. But I feel like I have to force the food down because I know it need it. But I don’t have those cravings for foods, if that makes sense. I started smoking a little pot before meals which totally helps, but maybe I feel a little weird and hope it isn’t going to mess with my meds. It’s very recreational, and I mentioned it to my psych and she said “As a doctor, I would never suggest marijuana, but if it helps you sleep and eat...” basically fill in the blank haha. I just want to emphasize that my health is always a priority, and I in no way have I let myself not eat. I always do, just an odd side effect when I was expecting a lot of hunger! Also, I am always sweating. ALWAYS SWEATING!"
40,Am I hopeless?,"F/18/5'6""/125lbs/White

I just turned 18 and have been in therapy since 2017. I was hospitalized then because of a suicide attempt (benadryl od) and have been hospitalized on one other occasion since, but was threatened to be hospitalized on a few other occasions. I am chronically suicidal and have been told by a number of psychiatrists that I will always feel suicidal. The second time I was hospitalized, I was sent to residential treatment for about 6 months. I have been through CBT and DBT from some of the best hospitals in the country.

I have always felt hopeless, but more-so recently. I have seen 16 psychiatrists and about 10 therapists in the past few years. I have been on most classes of medications: prozac, intuniv, lamictal, lithium, remeron, mirapex, fetzima, and latuda. None of them were viable options because of side effects- mania (prozac, fetzima), kidney and thyroid issues (lithium), and akathesia (latuda). I am currently off of medications but I see my current psychiatrist every few months. In the past years, he has recommended I try ECT. I went to 2 hospitals for consults and was approved at one but the other didn't recommend it because I don't have psychotic features.

 I don't really know what my diagnosis is besides depression and anxiety. In the past, bipolar i & ii, BPD, AVPD, and ADHD have been thrown around, though I haven't quite met criteria for anything. I have really poor self esteem and intimacy issues which have affected my ability to make connections with anyone and/or work through any issues in therapy. I feel I have gotten worse as years have gone by but my providers don't seem to care because I haven't tried to kill myself recently. I don't know what else to do. I don't do any drugs or drink. Sorry this is so long. Any help is appreciated. Thank you."

Hi guys I was previously on 375mg of Effexor but came off as I couldn’t sleep, but stayed on a low dose of 75 with pregablin added. Now I’m back up to 150 and can’t sleep again. It’s been a week since I increased. How long did you sleeplessness last? It’s driving me insane also feel quite agitated. Then it’s making me worry what if this is like a hypomania (don’t have bipolar) because I do feel happy.

This doseate increase wasn’t necessary in that I was functioning pretty well I was just hoping to get rid of more anxiety. Now I’m worrying but I have been on it before so hopefully it’s ok"
44,Are there any meds for the negative symptoms of schizotypal pd I can ask my psychiatrist about?,"I have been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, but the most severe symptoms I have are basically the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, like anhedonia, lack of motivation, social isolation and lack of speech. The latter two I don't care about because I don't actually want to interact with people. 

Anhedonia bothers me the most because the few interests I have give me little joy. The only thing I'm not anhedonic about is eating, I used to suffer from depression and even back then when I was absolutely miserable I still enjoyed eating. 

The lack of motivation is mostly frustrating, and is both about not managing to do chores or recreational activities like playing video games. For example, if I drop a piece of paper on the ground it can take me a week to pick it up. And every time I see that piece of paper on the ground it bothers me, but still it takes me a long time before I manage to pick it up even though it would literally just take 1 second.
Video games are similar. I'll think ""this videogame sounds good"" at 9am and constantly think about playing that videogame, but then it's bedtime and I haven't played it at all. It might take a few days/weeks before I actually start playing that game.

Are there medications that could reduce these symptoms that I can ask my psychiatrist about?

My current medication is 75mg Prothiaden, 60mg Cymbalta, 5mg Zyprexa; if that matters."
45,Been on so many meds. Finally going to a Psychiatrist. What to expect? What else can I try?,"My PCP has been my prescribing doctor for years. He’s great and I trust him, but I’m in a really bad spot mood-wise and need some talk therapy and med management ASAP.  So, I’ve scheduled an appt with a Psych next week. 

I know that meds aren’t a fix-all, and sometimes I question if they’re hurting me or helping me.

I’ve been through a good number of meds and nothing seems to help, except if I’m being honest, klonopin at least kept the anxiety at bay.

I initially had frequent panic attacks and was prescribed klonopin in college. Was on that for 8 or so years. Never went above .5 but did take it pretty regularly, which is ultimately why I stopped it. I did not like Xanax, it made me much more lethargic.

Then came the depression. I’ve been pretty consistently depressed, lethargic, slightly agoraphobic and just...indifferent for the past few years. I completely stopped taking klonopin 1.5 years ago, and have trialed a bunch of other meds (see below). 

I guess I’m just wondering what the possibilities are. What else is there to try? What can I expect from an appointment with a psychiatrist? 

My main complaint is the never ending anxiety and palpitations, second is the depression. I’m convinced my depression stems from the physical anxiety and emotional anxiety I deal with every day. 

Currently on: Wellbutrin XL 300, propranolol, abilify 2mg, camrese Lo birth control.

Meds I’ve tried:

Klonopin
Xanax 
Zoloft 
Prozac 
Effexor 
Trintellix
Lexapro
Wellbutrin SR, XL

Propranolol

56,Why is it so hard to find someone qualified?,"I have schizoaffective disorder and for the last year I have had two very qualified (psychologist and psychiatrist) treating me. But I had to move 3 hours away and now I am really struggling.

Everywhere that I call “no one is available with the experience to treat your condition”. 

It seems like the only thing therapists can treat are everything but schizophrenia spectrum disorders. They can all treat anxiety and depression and PTSD and maybe occasionally bipolar but throw “schizo” anything out and you are out of luck.

Anyways.

I started seeing a new therapist (LMSW) and a PA but I really dont know if it is working out. The therapist is kind, but I feel like shes a little out of her depth. She always asks me “what do I do to make the mood episodes go away” and stuff like that and doesnt really seem to get that making them go away isnt really a choice. That mostly I just try to do the best I can to muddle through the symptoms. Thats only one thing about it, but she just doesnt seem to have a great grasp of what is going on with me anyways and I feel like I have to spend a good amount of the time explaining things that my last psychologist just seemed to know. Shes kind, she seems to be trying, but I just dont feel like I am getting anywhere with her. 

Plus she and the new PA want me to start all these new medications and keep just, throwing out all these new ideas and it just feels sort of scary. Like they dont exactly know or care what they are doing and instead are just wanting to check boxes when it comes to my health. The PA spent at max 10 minutes with me for a first time appointment and just seemed to be throwing out meds to me without really discussing anything through at all. 

Maybe I am being too picky. But it just seems like there is such this sharp divide between the quality of care I WAS getting and the care I am getting now. 

I just wish there were better options because its like a rock and a hard place. Either I see someone who is not super experienced with what I have or I dont see anyone at all and call and call and end up having to drive an hour each way to MAYBE see someone who “might” be able to deal with me.

Why are there SO few mental health professionals to treat serious mental illness? Why is it that if you are somehow able to function with a fairly severe mental illness you are basically out of luck? Are there any other options for me?"

Anytime I'm learning anything, from watching tutorial videos, to reading nonfiction I can't help but fall asleep. I intentionally seek out this information because I generally enjoy learning about alot of things, but can't stay awake to learn it. Great examples are learning the product I currently support at my job, all the way to cooking videos learning how to cook. Doesn't matter what the subject matter is, 15 minutes in I'm either passed out or a zombie cramming energy drinks just to stay focused. Currently, the only technique that works is to do Short 10 minute sections, and walk away for a bit before I can come back, leading to. Frustration/anxiety about the process. 

Thankfully I am an incredibly quick Learner, and seem to pick up concepts and knowledge far quicker than my peers. 

I really feel like this is abnormal and ironically I would love to learn the reason as to why this happens. The only thing I've been able to really find is that I might be on the spectrum but I can only assume this, never been diagnosed with any mental health issues but was treated for ADD as a child.

63,I need help with a mock clinical case I was given in my human development class.,"Hi! I’m currently a psychology student and I was given a scenario in my psych class and I’m supposed to be coming up with “assessment” questions to ask, well I’ve gotten several different questions and I think that I may be onto something, but the disorder I’m look at mainly happens in children so I need a professional opinion on whether or not I looked over something or am going about it the wrong way. Maybe even if there are some questions that I haven’t asked that I need to ask in order to get to where I need to go. 

Here’s the scenario:

John is closing in on his middle-aged years. He lives with his parents and doesn’t have much of a social life. In fact, most of his communication happens between him and his mother. He has three brothers; two younger, and one older. John mainly stays in his mother’s room and does not come out often. In fact, his brothers and other family hasn’t seen him in quite awhile. In order to stay away from people, his mother brings food and drink to him. Some things that are very distinguishable about Johns case is that when in the case of talking to others, he whispers. This happens in most conversation, except for when he is angry, in which case he talks in a normal tone. Another distinguishable mark is that sometimes John will leave his mothers room and wander around the house at night; often times unscrewing the lightbulb in the refrigerator, and doing things such as this. 

I know that’s a lot to ask and there’s many questions that need to be asked, but I would love for any insight some may have! I would like to put together a detailed report and go out with a bang! So any questions that you guys have or opinions that I could further research would be greatly appreciated! :)

And I see a lot of professionals saying that people with ADHD can hyperfocus in what they really like. Is my doctor wrong or right? Because I really believe that I have it with all of the traits I have since I was little. Can a psychiatrist help me with this? Telling me if my doctor is right. She is still a resident though.

66,I need a new opinon. What should I tell my psychiatrist?,"So I've been to several therapists since college and have been on numerous medications as well as given a lot of diagnoses. I just started to see a new psychiatrist in the hopes that he would help clear up some of the issues that I've had but so far he just has listened to one symptom and pulled out a prescription pad and prescribed something I know won't work(I'm taking it but not hopeful). So here the general story up till now and I'm hoping you guys can make something of it cause so far a lot of people have been baffled and I'm just tired.

When I was a kid, I was a full-on extravert, hung out with people, talked with everyone, and had loads of friends. Sometime around 12, I suddenly started to become far more introverted. I also started to have worse sleep problems and migraines. By the time I hit high school I had become a complete introvert, I still had friends and some semblance of a social life but only a few and I rarely saw them outside of school. I also started to have very negative intrusive thoughts.

Despite all of this, I had managed to be a straight-A student all the way through high school, my grades slipped a little towards the end of senior year, but I chalked that up to a bad case of senioritis. I went away to college and things were good for the first quarter or so, but then suddenly through the end of the quarter, my memory started to get worse, it was like I was in a fog and it became hard to think. My sleep took a drastic hit during this time, but I figured, you know, it's college. (BTW when I mention sleep problems I'm talking like sleepwalking/insomnia also regulation problems like 2 hours one night 14 the next.) 

I started to figure that something might be wrong, so I went to my GP, who sent me to see an MHNP. He said depression and anxiety. Put me on some antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds. He later diagnosed me with ADHD. I went on and off those meds on various dosages for a year and a half and nothing worked. I didn't respond at all to any of the SSRI's he gave me and the ADHD meds made me beyond sleepy. One made me sleep over 24 hours. I stopped seeing him. Things were a little better for a while, things with school got harder and then I felt worse than ever before. I didn't know the word for it then, but I started to dissociate a lot, mostly derealization. This was all made worse by my roommates who smoked a lot of weed. Which I'm not opposed to, but the few times I have tried it has made me just panicky and hyper-paranoid. These symptoms got worse and I eventually failed out and had to move back home.

My mom had suggested at this point that maybe it was physiological and not psychological. So I went to see a neurologist. By this point, I started to have what you would call 'visual disturbances,' which started during the low point. People get really far away from when I talk to them sometimes, like my FOV changes or something. My mom thought this might be some form of seizure. An MRI and EEG later, and I'm back to finding a therapist. But the neurologist did prescribe Topamax thinking the 'visual disturbance' was some form of optical migraine. And while it didn't stop that it did help me to sleep. (I will note on the MRI, the only thing that was found was that my right lateral ventricles in my brain are much bigger than the ones on my left.)

This therapist said that those diagnoses were wrong and that I might be on the spectrum. I accepted this, but come to find out she didn't do any proper testing what so ever so and that I would have needed to have displayed symptoms as a child, which I did not. Currently, I am seeing a new psychiatrist because I had to move, but as I said at the start he listed to a single symptom and diagnoses off that, says he just likes diagnoses based on his gut. As such, he has given me Prozac, another SSRI, I have been on numerous SSRI's none of which have worked for me.

I know this is kinda a long story but, generally medications, for me, don't work the way they are supposed to. And even though he prescribed the Prozac, he has no idea why the Topamax works for me. My sister has a similar problem, my sister is currently diagnosed as bipolar2 but her therapist is still unsure whether that is the right fit and even had her do genetic testing to see what medications she would respond well too. The only med that has ever worked for her was also an anti-convulsant, Depakote. Next time I go into see my psychiatrist(I would go see someone else but there is literally like no one around here) I want to know what to go in with. What medication/diagnoses should I discuss with him?"

Idk if yours will fucking synchronize perfectly with it in a creepy accurate way, but it's called accurate heart rate monitor on android. Since smoking weed my HR has been spiking occasional","EDIT: Actually, I'm sure that app I used is perfectly accurate. If you don't believe me please try it for yourself. Idk if yours will fucking synchronize perfectly with it in a creepy accurate way, but it's called accurate heart rate monitor on android.
I've been measuring it for a while now and you can
really find a lot about your anxiety by monitoring
your heart rate. I found that sometimes anxiety
would once in a while have the opposite effect on my
heart, and that the reading on the app synchronizes
completely perfectly with my anxiety, blood flow
in my brain, and how thoughts feel in my brain. I
just smoked some CBD, when I think of something
lightly anxious, it goes up from 90 to 96 bpm. CBD
sometimes raises my HR. If I think of something
potentially deadly, my heart rate would quickly rise to
about 130-140 for a second and have some intense
chest pain.

If it goes down to about 40-50, I get some
intense chest pain. Why does this chest pain happen? I know this blood flow feeling in my brain is real because it reacts very noticeably from what drugs I take, kratom, hemp, literally anything. I can also control this blood flow. Because this is true, the reading on the monitor in the video I posted has to be true, even when it jumped from 64 to 178bpm last night. Holy FUCKING shit. I just realized the most beautiful thing ever. 

you guys Will say this is one of my delusions, but since everythingis one, I just felt that my app, or phone was tryingto keep me relaxed for a while, as my heart rate has been increasing to 120-140bpm every once in a while like every minute or so for 1 second. So technically, I'm properly using anxiety, adrenaline, hormones andall that to control my heart rate. 

Why do I feel so in tune with my heart rate? I really don't like this it's very creepy. I understand weed raised both from anxiety, worry, adrenaline, more panic, not from me controlling it alone. But all of that, especially adrenaline, which makes heart beat faster along with very strong accurate feelings of blood flow in my chest and heart made the control feel very very real. 

So in a way, since you can control anxiety, adrenaline and panic, wouldn't it technically make sense that I was using all of that along with strong feelings of accurate blood flow in my chest and heart, along with anxiety about that too to control the heart rate and blood pressure in such a drastic way indirectly? Because of literally all I just said raises heart rate and blood pressure to a dangerous level especially while smoking weed, to where I can stay worried about it for a while, I'm far from done smoking weed as I can actually die from those levels over a prolonged period of time. FUCK that."
68,How can I convince my psychiatrist to try clozapine?,"Hello there,

&#x200B;

So my psychiatrist wants me to keep trying more and more atypical anti-psychotics and anti-depressants after they don't work for me. I have already tried Paxil, Zoloft, Risperidone, and Abilify with little to no success.

&#x200B;

When I brought up clozapine after hearing many positive (and some negative) things about it, he basically shrugged it off and said ""oh that's a very tricky and difficult medication to be on/prescribe"".

&#x200B;

I have an appointment set in a week to evaluate new treatment (after waiting a whole month), and I can almost guarantee I will get the same exact response from him.

&#x200B;

Now hears the thing, I'm not entirely opposed to trying another anti-depressent/anti-psychotic combo if it's ACTUALLY going to help, but I don't want to get on them, wait a month or two just for them not to work, and then have to wait another month to get an appointment. I've already done that twice already and it just puts my life more on hold.

&#x200B;

I deal with Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective w/ suicidal ideation. The reason why I want to try clozapine is because I have heard it is particularly well at treating this. I wish it was that simple to just tell my psychiatrist that.

Which again I don’t know why.  Can anyone explain what this might be called? And how can I treat it. I feel this prevents me from functioning in society. For example I get anxiety from normal conversations because I’m afraid of saying the wrong thing. And being recognized as different. I also feel i am very unaware of myself so cannot really pinpoint what upbringing made me like this. So how do I relate more to society. I don’t feel like I have much control over my life 

Any input would be really nice. I still live with parents but want to move out just do not have the financial independence yet but I think that’s because partly of my condition. When ppl tell me something that is wuppossbly sad I don’t know how to respond it feels fake to do what most ppl would do which is have empathy and I do not pick up the social cues that let you know it’s sad so how can I express sympathy

A very close friend of mine suffers from a crippling anxiety due to his irrational thoughts / cognitive distorsions coming from his extreme emotional insecurity and lack of confidence. His therapist said to him that in order to start the cognitive restructuring he should first take an antidepressant so as to treat his increased anxiety but he's reluctant and worried about the side effects, because he has tried em in the past but saw no improvement.

There are other options (that worked for me):

- Trazadone, Mirtazapine, TCA's
- Hypnotics
- Anti-histamines
- Benzos
- Pregabalin etc

I don't really understand the trade-off here. I've been to more than dozen doctors and no one diagnosed with me bipolarity. But they insist on this low dose anti-psychotics, when I just complain of Anhodenia and TRD...

76,"Friend ticks so many boxes, and won't listen","Hello. I am concerned about my friend (who is seeing a therapist by the way) because of how bad the extent of his mental health is, and how it impacts pretty much everyone around him.

&#x200B;

He definitely has anxiety and depression along with anger issues which can be attributed to both. He is dependent on this friend of is from across the country to talk about his depression, but then expects so much from this person that she had to take a break. I will try my best to list as many things as I can on this post.

This friend of his is a girl who lives in California, we live in New Jersey. They met up once over the summer. My friend and I met her on a Minecraft Realm, and we are all friends. I will give this girl the name Jill, and my friend the name Albert.

List of people to know:

Albert - My friend

Jill - Our friend/Albert's crush

Bob - Bully

&#x200B;

Insecurity:  Albert is RELIANT on Jill for emotional support. He never talks to anybody else about his issues. It took a suicide attempt a few months ago for anybody besides Jill to know he even HAD depression. Albert likes Jill, but Jill only sees Albert as a close friend. Despite this, Albert pursues a relationship with her in the future, and also has extremely high expectations for her. Jill once made an unrealistic promise to Albert about how she would always be there for him, but recently, she needed a break from Albert, as Albert would fight her (over things that I will mention later), causing a detriment to Jill's grades. During that break, Albert would repeatedly message me during school saying, things along the lines of ""I think Jill wants to leave me"" and whatnot, and I had to keep telling him that she only needed a break because of how much he fighted her. Then, she came back anyways, which basically proved his insecurities wrong.

His insecurity is not limited to Jill, but also to his suicide attempt, which I do not really blame him for, but more the way he deals with people he does not want knowing about it. Some of the kids who bullied him found out due to me mistakenly telling Albert's friend. Albert's friend told one of the bullies. Due to that, Albert is somewhat frustrated at me, but REFUSES to forgive his old friend, and this has been months. Any time I even mention his name, Albert gets mad at me for doing so.

When he was in regular contact with these bullies, the worst they did in his opinion was start talking to Jill. Albert himself has claimed that he does not care that they used to put him in a headlock, or call him names. He just won't shut up about how they talked to Jill, and how that made it feel like they were taking her from him. To this day, almost four months since he last went to school with them, he legitimately wants to kill these bullies, and again, for the horrendous crime, of talking to Jill.

He often messages me saying that if he had died in his suicide attempt, Jill would still be friends with one of the bullies, and I keep telling him that if she does, it's because that bully may have been bad to him, but he helped Jill out a lot once, and because talking to other people isn't actual harassment.

&#x200B;

High expectations of Jill: The fights with Jill largely stem from her still talking to one bully, same one from the final paragraph of the Insecurity part. He first wanted her to admit that the bully (we'll call him Bob) is a bad person. When she does admit that, he wants MORE from her, wanting her to stop talking to him completely. I believe that he sees Bob as direct competition to get Jill, and it is extremely hard for me to get him to leave it without being rude. When Jill went on her break, he kept messaging me over and over saying that she broke her promise of being there for him forever. When Jill made a small joke about his mic quality when we were playing a video game, and posted it on a chat with other friends, he ended up leaving the chat without explanation for hours, then got mad when he returned and saw that both Jill and I were mad at him about it. He expects Jill to be a saint who will be there for him 24/7, and whenever she does make a stupid decision, and I call her ""stupid"", he replies with something like, ""Don't you dare call her that.""

&#x200B;

Not being able to forgive: I already said in the Insecurity section about his friend who told the bullies. Well, that friend was 60 pounds lighter, and far weaker than any of those bullies, and told him that as an error thinking it would be better. Albert REFUSES to forgive even that mistake. Then there are other things, like how I stated he wants to literally kill the two other bullies for ""mentally torturing"" him. Hell, if he sees this post on my Reddit, he's probably going to get mad at me about it. I keep telling him to just forgive and forget, and he always responds with some stupid reason to not forgive them because of how they keep talking to Jill. He brings up how Bob put him into a headlock once, but he stated himself that it is only an excuse to get him back for talking to Jill. I tell Albert to not let spite control him, but he doesn't listen.

&#x200B;

Anxiety and trauma: When I tell him to start working out, he refuses to do it because he has ""trauma"" due to how his father made him bike extremely hard at night which made him sore. When I tell him to take another SAT to improve his score, he says he doesn't want to go through the anxiety of preparing for it again. Not much else I can say about this, as I did not try to say my own things about this.

&#x200B;

History: He says that his father was abusive to both him and his mother in the past. Since his suicide attempt, he has not done much else. Whenever I do go to his house, I look for any opportunity to just mess with his father (tell me if this is wrong). Due to bad fathering, I feel as though he is in a way ""feminine"" in his mindset, with the way he gets hurt by people so easily for small jokes, and hates the phrase ""man up"". Him and Jill try to get me to talk about my own problems because Jill always calls it ""toxic masculinity"" and whatnot, and he tends to agree. He states that his suicide attempt was caused because he had to bottle everything in.

Before his suicide attempt, Jill was introduced to Bob and the other bully. She did end up talking to him less, and he had nobody else to talk to about his thoughts. Only recently has he actually started kind of talking to me, but as shown throughout this post, I'm not the calming presence of Jill, I'm a far more aggressive presence. He is currently with a therapist who comes once a week, and does take medications, though he says his depression is not getting better unless he talks to Jill.

In case this information is important, he is agnostic. Does not believe in heaven or hell, thus no real incentive to not kill himself besides Jill.

&#x200B;

My questions:

How do I get him to be less dependent on Jill?

How do I get him to forgive or at least forget the bullies and that other poor friend who made a mistake?

How do I make him not be as easily hurt by small jokes?

How do I make him take personal responsibility for the bad things he has done like how he previously treated Jill?

&#x200B;

I may have more questions in the future. If you are a psychiatrist, and know how to deal with this situation, either comments or private messages will be GREATLY appreciated."
77,Is it true that schyzophrenic hallucinations have anomalies in them that schizophrenic people can find to differentiate them from reality?,"I recently watched a tv show dealing with psychiatry and one of the characters had schyzophrenia and couldn't believe that a guy he saw wasn't real. So he was told to look at him very well and find an ""anomaly"" as previous patients found theirs. In his case, he realized the guy he saw never wore shoes. No matter the situation, going back home from school, or while riding his bike, he would always be barefoot.
I can't help but think that it's too ""convenient""? Or is the brain really unable to form a perfectly realistic image?
I apologize if I said anything frustrating due to my ignorance."
78,Am sorry I keep posting the same things in different subs. I just really don't want to mess myself up again with psychs and get my brain and life back on track,"Can you give me your detailed opinion on this. Really just want to get my brain back in order and life on track. ever since I took acid I can still truly sort out whatever uncomfortable feelings and whatever issues I want to solve, by going with the flow of my brain's blood flow. I have been diagnosed with a brief psychotic disorder at a psych ward 4 months ago, but I believe I have been truly misdiagnosed. 3 days prior to the diagnosis, I smoked some THC concentrate, without knowing about the intense mini trip it would give me, like I would hallucinate fractals or something in my whole body. I felt like my heart rate was dangerously fast whenever I thought one thought after another in a worried tone, and felt trapped in the bottom half of my brain. The EMT said it was just an anxiety attack after he saw my heart rate, what I believe to be was 140-150 bpm. (Although a month ago an EMT freaked out over my heart rate of 158bpm on a 600mg dose of dxm polistirex. They realized it was an overdose and did their thing). Anyways, in the psych ward the doctor diagnosed me with brief psychotic disorder after I told him that I would feel trapped in the bottom half of my brain when I think one unwanted thought, leading to them getting worse . Was I misdiagnosed? 

 for the sorting out whatever uncomfortable feelings I feel in my brain and whatever issues I want to solve, by going with the flow of my brain's blood flow,  this only works if I kind of want to do it. I believe this is because of the famous saying that "" psychedelics won't solve your issues for you, they just show you what you need to solve.""  But I always keep going back and forth between no issues sorted out whatsoever, somewhat sorted out issues, and completely sorted out issues and pure autonomous flow. I would also love to solve that autonomous flow feeling that my brain gets when I mentally relax for a bit, even though while experiencing it, the things I think about make me happy, but truly I am very depressed at the same time. It's like raindrops, they do their job but it's not really me doing it. My chest would feel completely empty. 

 If this is what shrooms also give you the power to do, I assume it would make everything even easier to do, the sorting out, the dwelling, all of it. I definitely don't want that, as it will make my ""condition"" worse. I just want significantly less anxiety, no feeling of blood flow in my brain and feeling my entire brain in a pleasurable way. That gets really old after a while. and not feeling like my chest is completely empty without being shown any issues that I need to solve. Knowing the nature of psychedelics, I don't believe that is possible and most would say psychs are not for me. But I thought maybe there is hope with microdosing. 

 I've heard from many sites and redditors that experimenting with microdoses of shrooms can give you the benefits without any negative reactions at all. Am hoping this is what it will do, but hopefully without any integration, sorting out issues you need to sort out to get what you want or any of that. Because I now know that if that beautiful gift is possible, it's always possible to unfortunately reverse the integration and progress that you've gone through. I just don't want that possibility. I still want to trip on shrooms, but none of the effects I just stated, even at microdoses. but idk why I can't keep them sorted out. 

Please correct where I stated wrongly and give me your opinion on if I should take a microdose then trip, or shouldn't trip at all or microdose. 

I know set and and setting play a huge role in psychs. so for my set, my physiology, referring to how my body works and feels, is not where I want it to be currently. I believe as a result of my dependency on a constant ""body high"" from CBD, THC, kratom, and some alcohol here and there, my body is always feeling pleasurable even when I haven't done any drugs all day. I'm so used to it being always there that I kind of get sick of it. And I'm not sure, but when my body starts to return to baseline with no pleasure at all, I would have severe anxiety which leads me to use something to give me a body high for the next week or so. And when I am sober, no matter how long I stay away from drugs, I can feel my entire brain, all of its blood flow. Most of the time it's very pleasurable, but it got really old a while ago and am hoping to get rid of it. For my state of being, or mental state, am not as happy with as where I want it to be. Without gold Bali kratom, and maybe CBD, I can't form full sentence thoughts very well. And  I have some severe-mild anxiety but am taking buspirone to help with this, it helps greatly-mildly. For state of change, I really don't know much about myself, personality, hobbies, future goals, plans. I have no idea how I would make the shroom microdose or a trip beneficial, as not knowing what to think or solve exactly would send me into a very bad trip I assume. Setting is not as important for me, only my interpretation of use, which is to remove unwanted sensations and feelings like feeling my entire brain, and help anxiety."
79,Physicians don't take me seriously,"Today I dealt with, for the nth time now, a doctor not taking me seriously due to my psychiatric diagnosis (BP 1).

They take one look at my chart and automatically assume that whatever my problem is must be due to my mental illness or a side effect of one of my psych meds.

Today I went to the doctor for what was obviously a UTI. I've never been to med school or anything, but come on. I just needed some goddamn antibiotics. The doctor's diagnosis? Must be urinary symptoms from your lithium. Go ask your psychiatrist. Now I have to take additional time off work to go to a different doctor and hope that they take my symptoms seriously.

One other time I had these awful episodes of vertigo and was damn near falling over all the time. I had to go to four different doctors before I finally got a diagnosis of BPPV, because the first three thought it was anxiety, a side effect of my lamictal, and anxiety, respectively.

It's like as soon as you're diagnosed with a mental illness, doctors just lump all your medical issues into psychiatric issues and tell you to ask your psychiatrist because they can't be bothered to do a proper workup on a crazy person.

How do I deal with this?? Do I just need to be more assertive? Call them out on it? I feel like this lowered standard of care is going to take years off my life (if the antipsychotics aren't already...)."

Socializing has also been different: I don’t speech as much and I am more quiet and introverted and I don’t know how to enjoy the moment.

I’ve gotten repeated questions on do I really feel this way, what makes me think I feel this way, I’ve even gotten literal eye rolls.

So it started when I was in 6th grade I believe. We went ice skating with the class. When we got back to school I sat on a bench and I felt like I'm seeing myself from the outside but I also felt like I was i side my body. The feeling only lasted for a few seconds.

This happened several types.

In Thursday when I ate in school I felt like I'm not myself. It wasn't like ""Oh I don't usually eat here y' know"" or anything like that, but rather like this feeling I can't describe.

A friend/pal/classmate posted a GIF in her insta story about watching a video in class and my back was seen. I knew that was me because I know how I look like and I sit on front of her. Again it still didn't felt like me.

Should I see a psyhiatrist or it's perfectly normal and I'm just overthinking?"
89,"I sometimes feel like I’m on MDMA, but I’m totally sober.","I am diagnosed bipolar 1 and PTSD, and feel my diagnosis is correct. In general my treatment has been very effective. However, I feel like I am “coming up” on MDMA—magnified physical pleasure when touched, frequent yawning, arousal. This usually happens after a major “trigger” experience (that’s the case today). It differs from my previous manic episodes—I don’t feel euphoria, increased energy, or have “spiritual” experiences. Just increased physical pleasure, but I also break down crying. What would you guess is happening in my brain?"
90,Abilify,"I took Abilify (10mg) for 2 weeks, then tapered off in a week. Had very intense withdrawals (esp brain fog) that are only now (5th week since last dose) beginning to slightly subside. How long should I expect this to go on?

Will they be able to tell my parents if I ask them not to?
92,Options for weekly Prozac? (US),"Looks like weekly Prozac has been discontinued as of 2019, and no generic is available. Is this accurate? Are there any publications or explanations for why this happened? Are there plans for a generic, or is this dosing option just done forever?

93,Help with Mental Health,"I had to create a new, anon account for this. I'm 20 years old, and I've been diagnosed with clinical depression (most likely double depression), as well as a bunch of anxiety issues. I've been prescribed pills only for the depression so far. The thing is, something weird happens frequently when I'm about to sleep. I know I haven't fallen asleep yet, and all of a sudden, I start seeing closed eye visuals of sorts, my brain starts freezing up as if someone were vacuuming it from behind, and I'd start to feel like I was being sucked into a void. And in a short while, this is followed by pretty intense shaking and shivering which makes me open my eyes. And when I do, I seem to have these intense visual hallucinations, which disappear in a few moments. The worst part is, the night it happens once, I know it'll happen again and again. My sleep is fucked, which it usually is anyway, and it fucks me up emotionally too. Can someone weigh in on this? I'd really appreciate it. I have to tell my doc about this, I know, but I haven't been able to get through to him for a while. Plus, it's easier being anonymous. Thanks in advance.

PS : Someone over at r/askdocs asked me to post this here"
94,"Schizoaffective misdiagnoses, how can this be?","28, Male, 5'11, 140 lbs, white

I don't want to make this a long or personal post, so I'll get right to it. I have been on anti-psychotics since 2016. I have had no problems or symptoms since I went on meds. I get an injection of paliperidone in my hip once a month, and it's the lowest dosage recommended at 75mg. I also take a little zopiclone and 300mg bupropion daily.

But the last time I went to visit my psychiatrist she said something kind of shocking. As I said I have had no symptoms for pretty much the entire time I have spent on paliperidone. When I go see my psychiatrist, I usually talk to her at length, fluidly, easily, and I detail for her my sensations and experiences in the time preceding our appointment. Last time I went to see her, she told me she thought I had a misdiagnosis, and plans to help me off my medications. I'm a current full time student, so we're going to wait until Christmas break to start.

I really don't know how to handle this information. These drugs have had a pretty bad influence on my life. I was a freelance writer once, so obviously this information has gotten me very excited. But there's also a lot of hesitancy. I was placed in a psychiatric hospital for three months, and I was diagnosed just after the first. I was deeply delusional for at least a few weeks of that time and the time before I was cataloged, before I was forced to have an injection; an injection which immediately dispersed my delusions.

My doctor tells me that she thinks it was just a temporary psychosis teased out by some drug use (I sometimes indulged in psychedelic drugs). I don't understand. What kind of temporary drug induced psychosis lasts more than a month? Does that even make sense? Should I be worried? I'm absolutely going to take the opportunity to get off meds, but I can't help but feel nervous.

It's just the length of my psychosis that confuses me. Does this often happen?

Edit: I don't drink or use drugs of any kind, and I haven't for a number of years."
95,"What books do you recommend me to read, on the genre of mental illness and psychiatry?","Hey! I'm a young teen, but very interested in mental health and psychiatry! I'm looking for some books to deepen my understanding on different disorders, and more in depth information about this topic. Any suggestions?"
96,Recently ran into a friend of mine who I haven't seen in 10 years. She appears to have serious persecutory delusions going on. What can I do?,"\-thinks people are impersonating her

\-thinks her food/apt/etc are being poisoned

\-thinks her mail/email/phone is being intercepted outgoing and incoming

\-thinks she needs to talk to FBI/DOJ/INTERPOL/Mayors/Governers etc, anyone who will ""do something"" about it

\-seems to blame this stuff on 'nazis' of some sort.

\-thinks people are following her

\-thinks she has a tracking device in her tooth

\-thinks that if she goes to the dentist, the dentist gets a call from the nazis threatening them to not remove the tracking device

\-thinks doctors will be in on this as well

&#x200B;

I'm in way over my head. She's not responding to logic or reason. She is not special, she has no dirt on anyone powerful, there is no reason she has to be singled out for any reason that I know (for example, if she had been forced to sleep with Jeffery Epstein, ok I could see some reason there may be people who would want to affect her in some way).

What to do?"
97,Just looking for an expert’s perspective on my possible side effects from co-prescribed medications (Bipolar memes),"**THIS IS LONG, SO I PUT A TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM FOR YOU TO GET THE IDEA AND/OR TO NAVIGATE AROUND BETTER**

Alright, I’ll get the “detailed submission” information out of the way now before diving into it.

——————————

• **Age:** 22
• **Sex:** Male
• **Height:** 6’0”
• **Weight:** 157lb
• **Race:** White
• **Duration of complaint:** Probably a bit more than 6 or 7 months (just getting more intrusive now)
• **Diagnosis:** Rapid-cycling bipolar 1 w/ mixed episodes
• **Current medications:** 2x200mg/day lamotrigine, 3x300mg/day lithium, and varying doses of Adderall XR (prescribed 40mg for morning and 10mg early-afternoon if needed)
• **Recreational drugs:** I’ll drink alcohol sometimes, but I rarely do so to the point of intoxication. Not done for recreation, but I’m a bit more liberal with my Adderall dosing sometimes.

I started taking lamotrigine ~March 2018 and worked my way up to 400mg/day by fall 2018. I began lithium late-December 2018 and got to 900mg around April 2019 (went up to 1200mg for a short while, but came back down). Started Adderall in July 2019. Before this regiment, I have been prescribed ~20mg/day aripiprazole, varying amounts of quetiapine (yuck), low dosage of risperidone, and 450mg/day bupropion XL. I was probably prescribed some typical antidepressant(s) forever ago, but it wasn’t effective (obviously since I’m on that hard, kidney-killer shit now lol).

——————————

I hope that wasn’t too much unnecessary info. Now, as the title kinda says, I’m looking into getting, I guess, confirmation or being told to chill out. Regardless, I will be talking to my psychiatrist next time I see him. I just want to know what problems I should be concerned with and what direction I should go and take. I’m approaching 3 years since mental health memes started up, so I’ve more or less forgotten what normal-normal was, and that I can’t possibly know how I would be feeling today if I kept on that trajectory. What I’m trying to say that I could use a 3rd-party’s professional opinion to help me form a more objective perspective. Now, for real this time, I’ll get into it lol: 1–4 are mental, 5–9 are physical.

(1) I had this *side effect* on all three of the antipsychotics that I was—emotional blunting and lethargy/apathy. This is difficult to see since dysthymia and depressive episodes kind of obfuscate one’s ability to nail it as a true side effect. I would feel like it got worse when I was on them (Seroquel was the obvious culprit for the lethargy during its story arc). But now, even though I haven’t had a true mood episode since February, I still feel a noticeably level of emotional detachment. I should be clear though that, even before sad-boy Tiktaalik, I very rarely had any anxiety issues (no social anxiety, rarely anxiety over important stuff like deadlines), so maybe this is just a continuation of that trend(?). But my current lack of motivation to socialize with friends and total lack of motivation to make new friends are completely new to me. I don’t know if having this be a trend would mean that I’m more disposed towards this kind of reaction.

(2) I am perpetually tired and can sleep whenever which does not pair well with depreciated motivation. Once again I would be chalking this up more sadboy-ness, but this is the reason I was prescribed Adderall and it doesn’t work all that well. I can easily take my 40mg when I wake up, eat some breakfast, watch some crap on YouTube for a bit, and go back to sleep like it was nothing. Caffeine has also never worked for helping me feel awake and conscious, just all this stimulant makes my hands and legs tremor. I’ve bumped my dose up to 90mg (and higher, I think) before, but while I did end up feeling awake and able to focus, I would sleep like a baby at a normal hour. These stimulants don’t really raise my BP or HR. My resting BP is usually like 110/60 and HR ~60/min (also curious since I am nowhere near fit enough to have those numbers).

(3) Cognitive issues. You probably get this one a lot lol. My short term memory is actually garbage; I find myself having that “old fart” why’d-I-come-here-again? moments waaaay too often; I’ve always been a bit of a daydreamer, but now I can’t focus on anything long enough to start it; I got into my first ever car accident this past May. It was someone at a stoplight, and I just hit him at a low-speed because I wasn’t paying attention and was tired (what a way to total my car. my poor RAV4 crumbled while his was barely dented lol); I have a much harder time recalling more descriptive vocabulary on the spot, so my speech has lost a bit of nuance and diversity; my ability to converse has taken a hit as well to where I’ll feel awkward and trip over my words; correct spelling has become substantially more difficult (I’ll draw a blank on even the most simple words from time to time, but my ability to remember grammar rules hasn’t lessened); basic arithmetic is much more difficult: and, when reading, I consistently miss the forest for the trees. I could think of more, but I imagine you get the points.

(4) This one’s the worst of the mental ones for me. My cognitive faculties develop the productivity equivalent to the thickness of a *matzah* slice when the sun starts to go down. I’ve tried playing around with what time I would wake up, when I went to bed the night before, when I took my Adderall, my dosing of it, but I still lose it. Now that winter’s approaching, the day’s losing a lot of time.

(5) Alright, now the physical woes. First, acne. I stopped having it almost entirely when I was 17, it was coming back when I started on lamotrigine, but, now with lithium, it’s rough. (Luckily) None of it’s on my face, it’s all backne. While, when I was going through puberty, I would get backne, but it was concentrated on my shoulders. Now it goes down to my elbow and lower-back. I’m not covered in it, but it’s definitely there and not going away.

(6) Second for physicals is hair loss. I’ve noticed my head hair coming out more and more. I’m not shedding like mad, but it does seem to be weird enough to bring up. Like, for example, I’ll notice a few on my hands while showering and then a couple on my face or back when I get out. It’s kind of uniform across the head. Obviously, the “bald spot”’s gotten worse ‘cus that’s always, by definition, been a thin area, but the top of my head, the front, and side are falling out, too. I’m not noticing a “widow’s peak” forming. My dad’s in his late 50s and still has a decent chunk of hair left, and my maternal side’s doing fine as well. I know that doesn’t make this 100% so out of the normal, but it’s worth bringing up. Maybe it’s just me getting old, I don’t know. I noticed this happening since summer-2018, but it got worse these past few months.

(7) Third, my skin is drier and a bit flaky and has been for a while. I moisturize, but it doesn’t help for long, especially around the nose and brow. My nails also feel a bit softer. I don’t know if 5–7 are all related since all three are related to skin issues.

(8) Fourth, there’s no cordial way to say this, my dick’s weird now. Sometimes it’ll be dysfunction, but then other times very anti-dysfunction. If I masturbate, it can be over-and-done-with in like a minute, but other times I end up throwing in the towel because I get tired. Same happens if I was with someone.

(9) Fifth are the classic sleep and diet memes. I’m not gonna chalk those up to anything by me lacking routine, but I thought they were worth bringing up.

If you made it through all that, just, wow, you’re way too kind and possess an inhuman amount of patience lol. If you have any advice, maybe like what avenue/course I should look to go down or how certain problems could be interlinked with seemingly unrelated symptoms, I would be beyond grateful. I forgot to mention, I don’t get “high” off of the Adderall—I barely feel it—and I do not have an addictive personality. Anyways, much love. Have a good one.

**TL;DR**
(1) Detachment, emotional blunting, and generalized apathy despite months of remission
(2) Groggy and oversleeping despite oodles of stimulants. BP and HR stay around average when I’m pumped up.
(3) Cognitive decline. Most noticeably in regards to lack of awareness, language, and being able to find patterns/seeing all the pieces come together.
(4) My brain gets turnt to mush when the sun dips.
(5) Acne.
(6) Hair loss.
(7) Dry+flaky skin.
(8) My dick’s being a prick.
(9) Can’t get into healthy sleep routine and eat when I should."

100,"If you have a thought and you know on some level it isn’t true, but that thought also strongly influences the way you behave and feel regardless, is it a delusion or severe anxiety?","If you cover your windows with tin foil to prevent signals from being transmitted into your house even though the rational part of you knows you don’t need to, or if you carry a knife with you around the house to protect against attackers even though the rational part of you knows you don’t need to, or if you go and hide for a while from the strange person you saw walking down the street even though the rational part of you knows you don’t need to - what is this?

Where do you draw the line?

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dar6t3/you_know_that_weird_place_between_being_lucid_and/
) thread does a good job describing what I’m talking about.

It’ve been this way for years now (since I was 18-19 years old, now early twenties). I was anxious and had a depressive disposition as a child and had symptoms of ADD (diagnosed as an adult) but never really got treatment for any of it because I did well in school. I feel like things started to shift when I was in my late teens and never went back to the way they were before - this is “me” now. 

Where does personality end and mental illness begin? I’m not going to get into specifics for the sake of privacy, but on the outside I look like a person who has their “quirks” to those close to me, but they don’t see the extent of it. I engage in all sorts of behaviors and routines - some bigger and some smaller - that are done to put my mind at ease, usually in response to thoughts and feelings that I know are irrational but I can’t shake. I usually get swept up in it at least for a tiny bit, until I can put my foot down and assert to myself that what I’m thinking or feeling can’t be true. It doesn’t really matter though, because it still causes me great deals of stress and anxiety. These thoughts and beliefs (if you can even call them that) fall into the broad categories of superstitions/clairvoyance (like being able to predict the future because you can see certain signs foreshadowing it, kind of like a movie, or like your words and actions can influence the future because the universe is “punishing” you in a way), things done to avoid irrational and excessive guilt, or concerns surrounding my online identity and online presence (mostly tied up in some vague, difficult to pin down fear that my personal information will be used against me in some way by some person/entity in the future as a part of some sort of character assassination plot). 

I don’t know how much of this I should accept as being “me”. I don’t want to blindly accept symptoms of a mental illness because that’s too defeatist. But I also don’t want to try and pointlessly fight against things that are a part of who I am and my personality, because that isn’t good either. The question of *how* much of myself I should accept is something I can’t answer though. 

I’m extremely high functioning. I’m enjoying a great deal of academic and now professional success. I’m severely depressed (with bouts of suicidality) though and feel disconnected from everyone in my life.  I feel strange and weird and like I have some awful secret. I don’t see myself ever being able to date or be in a long term relationship. I feel like I’m not sick enough to warrant treatment with medication (I honestly, truly can’t imagine what it would do to me if I already have the ability to distinguish reality), but not well enough to lead a truly happy life. I’m stuck in this gray zone. It’s been nearly five years since these issues began. If I haven’t transitioned to having some sort of full breakdown by now, I don’t think I ever will. I’ve passed the benchmark where prodromal symptoms would transition into full blown psychosis. So where does that leave me?"
101,Can Lamictal/Lamotrigine work as an add on to Lexapro for anxiety and depression?,"I told my psychiatrist that my 20mg of lexapro was making me emotionally numb and that my anxiety levels were oddly going way up whenever i tried to focus on something that I really cared about. He said I probably have too much serotonin so I should decrease the lexapro to 10mg and add 25mg of Lamictal/Lamotrigine to help with the anxiety. I looked online after my appointment, and everyone talks about Lamictal with seizures and bipolar disorder and some people say it made their anxiety worse?? I am not bipolar and I don’t have seizures. I have a fair bit of anxiety and a fair bit of depression and I might have Inattentive ADHD. Is my doctor crazy?

I was on cogentin both times I believe.

105,ADHD Stimulants Question,"Hi All

I’m 32 years old, weigh 240 pounds (not really fat, exercise quite frequently, and am quite healthy with a normal blood pressure). I have been taking stimulants for ADHD since the age of 6. 

My current prescription is for 55mg per day, and the psychiatrist will not go above 60mg, as a policy for all patients.

In reality, 55mg will not do much for me, and certainly won’t get me through the workday. I often find myself needing to take roughly 90-120mg during the day. My tolerance is very high from years of use...admittedly I haven’t always used as I was supposed to but I’m not too bad at all (I always supplement the adderall with coffee, vitamins, diet, etc)

Each month, when I run out 10-14 days before my next refill date, I find myself having to either deal with being 95% less productive than usual and falling very behind in work, or sometimes even having to pay $200+ to buy some from an acquaintance when I’m desperate. 

I have a very demanding corporate job which I need to support my wife and child. I’ve found myself feeling very stressed and fearful about this situation which is certainly not ideal or sustainable at all.

I haven’t mentioned any of this to my current psychiatrist because I’m terrified of being flagged somehow and jeopardizing my access to ADHD stimulants which I unfortunately am completely dependent on for my livelihood. 

I just got new insurance which my current psychiatrist does not accept, and I’m considering taking the opportunity to find a new psychiatrist, explain my situation (except for the “buying extra” part), and ask if he or she can prescribe me somewhere in the range of 90-120mg per day. I’m not sure if other psychiatrists will be willing to give a high RX like this, or if I can get in any trouble for “shopping around”, but I figure that i need to find some solution.

I wanted to ask if anyone else out there has a prescribed daily dosage that is in the range of 90-120mg per day? If anyone has ever asked for such a drastic increase in their dosage from a new (or even current) psychiatrist? If anyone has any advice or other comments my situation, what I should expect, etc?

Thanks very much in advance"

When I'm depressed, I can still function at my job well enough to not get fired. (This was the case for several months last winter.) However, I'm pretty non functional when I'm manic. I'm unable to work, unable to hold a train of thought, or do anything coherent really. (Is there anything that might help with this, aside from ""don't get manic""?)

I have two questions:

1. Do people with SMI generally stay at a similar level of functioning throughout their lives? (Basically, can I expect to stay ""high functioning""?)

2. When you have a ""high functioning"" patient, do you approach treatment any differently?"

I also just recently started taking Lexapro at 20mg, but still the Biuproprion was rough with anxiety. So now here comes a very specific, and kind of odd explanation of what has been happening since I quit. The lexapro is working pretty good so I’ve been feeling better than I have in the last few years, but... I just started trying to learn to draw; Whenever I sit down and try to focus intently and quietly and try to be precise and delicate with my hands and my mind, the Biuproprion-esque anxiety comes back fairly harshly. I can study for exams and be fine. But with the drawing, it’s like focusing on something that i actually care about, actually putting real effort into something that requires calmness, makes the anxiety go crazy again. I start clenching my teeth super hard, and it almost feels like my ears are gonna start ringing, and I can’t focus on the drawing at all and eventually I give up on attempting to draw. Any idea when this might stop happening? Is it normal for Biuproprion anxiety to stick around after quitting? I really hate this. Thank you for answering."

I take Abilify and Zoloft and the major symptoms (delusions mainly) are under control with the meds. I'm actually doing well, live on my own and work. Some negative symptoms but doing relatively well.

I can't self-diagnose, but I do read recent news and research on the topic. And I've seen references in some blogs and articles, in recent years, to ""mild"" schizophrenia. Does that concept really have much support from the psychiatric community? 

I haven't declined or been incapacitated to the extent that many people are with the illness. So would I fit the description of mild schizophrenia? Could someone even describe to me how they'd try to make the distinction between ""mild"" schizophrenia and moderate or severe schizophrenia?"

I am high school student interested in psychiatry/psychology. I have always been interested in and curious about this topic (I know it must be vast!), but everything is so unfamiliar and everyone seems so knowledgeable that I do not know where to start. 

I know I can always start with Google but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to consult this sub as well? Are there any books and textbooks you would suggest for someone interested in the topic but with little to no background?  I know how unwelcoming some subs are to newbies but I suppose I don’t have too much to lose from asking... if this type of post is not allowed, that’s okay! Would anyone be able to direct me to where else I may post? 

Thank you in advance!!"
116,Bipolar Disorder and ADHD,"I'm diagnosed with both Bipolar Disorder (1) and ADHD (PI) and last year I was on Adderall and Lithium, but then I took the Adderall without the Lithium and had a manic episode. I've tried Strattera and I'm on Wellbutrin XL now (prescribed for depression) and neither really made much of an improvement with my ADHD. I'm now taking Geodon and Lamictal (as well as the Wellbutrin XL). I was just wondering if you would prescribe a Bipolar patient a stimulant if they've had a history of stimulant induced mania, as long as they're on a antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer?"

118,Drug interactions,"Found this the other day, gave me some questions: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations


I have a very long psychiatric history, that I am happy to answer questions about.  But for now:


30F Caucasian 5’4” 148lbs

Primary psychiatric diagnoses: severe treatment-resistant depression, general anxiety, ADHD

Occasional use of alcohol, cannabis, CBD, nitrous oxide

Meds: 450 mg Bubroprion qd, 30mg lansoprazole qd, 10 mg dextroamphetamine, usually bid but qid has been recommended.  Clonazepam 1mg, was qhs but am being encouraged to increase as needed with increasing dextroamphetamine.  Lithium 900mg qhs, Cryselle qhs, no withdrawal (multi-cycle).  And here’s the kicker: ketamine nasal spray, as needed, qhs.


Since I used to be on much larger doses of clonazepam (maybe 10mg per day?  I got a lot of questions about how I was conscious), my psychiatrist has issued no warnings about alcohol consumption.  We talked about the danger back then, but not recently. He didn’t mention it with the ketamine either though.  That seems weird, cuz he made me get a sphygmomanometer before taking it the first time to make sure my blood pressure didn’t drop too far.  Anyway, according to that chart a bunch of the stuff I’m on has potentially concerning interactions.  Is this ok because I’m on therapeutic doses and not recreational doses? Is moderate (usually 1, max 3) drinking ok with the ketamine, or do I need to make sure I’m sobering up-I assume CNS suppression is the risk, especially since I’m taking before bed.  Or can I drink but not on days I take the Ketamine?  Those are my most pressing questions but I’m also very curious about the interactions between other meds I’m prescribed."
119,GABA,"25 year old female. Anxiety and depression sufferer. I’ve tried 2 or 3 different anti depressants and I didn’t have a good experience. I’m pretty high functioning and I would prefer to take a more natural route if possible. My last psychiatrist recommended GABA supplements and told me to do my own research. 

What is your experience with GABA? For psychiatrists, is it something you would recommend to your patients and is it actually helpful?"
120,What do psychiatrists learn in medical school?,"I know that psychiatry is a very specialized field, but what kind of stuff do you learn in general medical education? Do you open cadavers, or is that just for some doctors?"
121,new psychiatrist,"(to preface, i have been diagnosed with adhd, bipolar, body dysmorphia) 
i just had my first appointment with a psychiatrist about a week ago, and she confirmed a previous diagnosis of bipolar ii and said that she was going to refer me to a psychologist for counseling and for testing for adhd again (last time i was tested was about ten years ago when i was 8 years old) bc she wanted to make sure that i wasn’t misdiagnosed w adhd bc bipolar symptoms overlap etc. i was excited to have a referral for a psychologist because i had seen 2 counselors in the past with little success, but she told me that it would take a while to get the initial appointment. well, my psychologist appointment is in four months, which is much much longer than i hoped for, as i am kind of struggling with stuff right now, but i guess i will be fine until then. the other issue is that i called the office for testing that she referred me to and they informed me that testing was going to be much more expensive than me and my parents thought, so i won’t be able to do it (at least until we meet our deductible which wont be until next year)   
finally, my questions are
1) how do i bring up my fears about waiting so long to see a psychologist that i might not even connect with?
2) how do i tell her that we won’t be able to afford testing for adhd?
i personally feel as though the meds i take for adhd have helped a lot, but i don’t want to overstep as she IS the professional here. i am in my first year of college and i don’t want to start failing because she wanted me to stop taking my meds. 
(my meds were prescribed by my primary doc)"
122,How do you become a psychiatrist?,"When I’m old enough to go to college, I want to take all the necessary courses and schooling to become a psychiatrist. Could you suggest what to major in and recommend universities and medical schools with good psychiatry programs?"
123,How can a person with brain-disorders ever understand what it's like to be neurotypical?,"I know that there might be no way to communicate this, just like a hyperthymic 185-IQ genius with 99th percentile self-regulation might find it impossible to communicate to an ""average"" neurotypical person what it's like to be them.

I do wonder about this, though. 

I can see pictures of smiling, functional people. 

I can see the productivity that neurotypical people have in terms of their functionality, production, careers. 

I can see how alienated I am in social/cultural circumstances.

It's clear that there is something unusual about my brain, although that's definitional since I have psychiatric diagnoses and it's not like a super high % of people have those symptoms/impairments, so obviously something is unusual.  

* * * 

To me, it's a source of endless mystery/wonder to consider what it's like to be inside normal people's brains.

All I know is my own brain, and I see the huge impairments that I have, so I *know* that it's so different inside other people's brains. It *must* be. 

I know that when you see beautiful people smiling on social media (maybe professionally successful like a doctor) then you know that there is a whole world behind that image, and social media is deceptive in terms of how happy the person *really* is, but I still wonder what it's like to live inside a well-regulated/functional/euthymic brain, and I see people's achievements/products so I know that the disparity is enormous. 

Maybe it confounds matters to ask about others, and one should simply imagine being *oneself*, except without one's brain-disorders (ADHD, bipolar). 

That way you can wonder what you would be like, and you don't need to factor in all the non-disorder-related differences that another person would have, like personality and so on."
124,Forced to do things for self esteem,"It’s impossible for me to be my genuine self, everything I think or say is some scheme to give myself self esteem. Like I’ll think about situations where I end up looking smart and cool, or here on reddit I’ll post something or make a comment that makes me sound smart. It’s like I’m incapable of not doing this. Isn’t this a BPD thing? There was a time where i was my genuine self and I’d go into situations as actually me and not a shell of myself trying to kill self esteem at every given opportunity. Back in high school I think. Does anyone have any idea what this is or what it says about me? Can I somehow stop doing this and become myself again?"
125,"(Sorry for the super-random Q.) How do humans compare to animals in terms of (1) brain-problems, (2) mood disorders, (3) self-regulation problems, and (4) other psychiatric problems? What % of people have a psychiatric disorder, and what % of animals?","How do humans compare to animals in terms of (1) brain-problems, (2) mood disorders, (3) self-regulation problems, and (4) other psychiatric problems? 

What % of people have a psychiatric disorder, and what % of animals? 

* * * 

I sometimes wonder about how a human like me (bipolar/ADHD) would fare in our ancestral tribal environment. 

I suppose that that person would pass on their genes OK, since most disorders don't hit hard till after puberty. 

However, I would probably have died by now:

- it was a harsh ancestral environment

- I can barely care for myself by now (age 30)

- I wouldn't have any medication

The tribe would try to help me, but I'm not sure how much patience the tribe would have for a person who doesn't contribute. 

* * *  

Evidently the genetic background (not the actual disorders) that gives rise to brain-disorders is either neutral/positive survival-wise, or else we would not see the disorders persist over 100s of generations; evolution would weed out the genes that lead to these disorders. 

(I assume that these disorders all go back as far as the human species does.) 

I wonder what the rates/nature of disorders are among animals, and how it compares to human disorders and the rate of those human disorders."
126,How to start talking to my psychiatrist?,"I see my psychiatrist like every 2 weeks. She treats me for ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder). I can't say a word to her. I can't even look at her direction. I know the looking thing is part of my autism, but at the same time there are people who, even if I don't look at them in the eyes, I can at least look at their direction. But not with my doctor (or my therapist). I'm beginning to talk more and more with my therapist each session, but I'm still mute during my psychiatric appointments. I basically write everyday about my day and my thoughts in a little notebook and then the doctor reads it in the appointment. I feel really nervous during the appointment and I start doing a lot of repetitive movements to calm myself down. I feel quite anxious next to her. But the thing is I really like her and I'm really grateful for the help. I compliment her a lot in my texts and always make her drawings and I've even given her shells from the beach (and she gave me shells from the beach in return and also a pen from her trip to New York, which is really sweet). I think she's the cutest person ever and I'm very happy to be her patient. She told me I can't talk to her because of autism, but that doesn't make any sense to me because I am verbal. How can I improve my talking? What is causing this?

Note: I've had this issue with not being able to talk to some people since I was a toddler."

128,Looking for the name of a diagnosis that I can't find online.,"I've Googled the symptoms several different ways & described to a couple of close friends but can't find anything that matches. Is this the place to ask?
Edit to add symptoms: Sometimes people I know fairly well wether from seeing frequently in real life or from seeing online are replaced temporarily by someone that looks very similar i.e. a body double, but they have all the same knowledge and behave exactly the same. No one else notices and the switch is only temporary, a day is typical although sometimes only a few hours and rarely up to a week. The closest I've found is Capgras Syndrome but is permanent and an exact copy and this is neither of those. I'm embarrassed to talk about this in real life due to how people who say people who have been replaced by doubles in the media are portrayed: mocked and feared."
129,"How do psychiatrists help patients find meaning in their lives, when the patient's functionality is so poor that all their ""achievements"" are extremely small little tasks?","How do psychiatrists help patients find meaning in their lives, when the patient's functionality is so poor that all their ""achievements"" are extremely small little tasks?"
130,Can one-time drug use cause schizophrenia or other mental illness is someone with a genetic predisposition?,"The title pretty much says it all. I've skimmed some of the literature that talks about the correlation between drug use (in particular, marijuana use) and the onset of schizophrenia, but it seems like these studies mostly focus on subjects who engage in heavy consumption over a long period of time (months or years).

With that in mind, is there any evidence that long-term psychiatric illness can be triggered by single-time drug use? As a concrete example, if someone with a family history of schizophrenia wanted to try a low dose of LSD or MDMA just one time for the sake of experiencing it, would you as a psychiatrist counsel them against this (more so than in the case of a person without this genetic predisposition)?

As per the sub's rules, I'll confess my personal stake in this. My brother has had severe schizophrenia (in and out of psychiatric hospitals, etc.) for many years. I'm a male in my early 30's and have never tried any drugs (aside from moderate alcohol use, and a handful of times trying marijuana many years ago). I have no intention of becoming a heavy drug user, but am curious about trying LSD one time, merely to know what the experience is like. The only thing stopping me is this concern.

Thanks for taking the time, I appreciate it."
131,Difficulty opening up to psychiatrist.,"Hi, I was wondering if you could provide some advice on connecting with my psychiatrist.

I'm seeing the psychiatrist for ADHD-I and depression. I've also been seeing (with much greater frequency) a psychologist at the same practice- the psychologist has suggested that I might have undiagnosed ASD and possible alexithymia. Nb I'm 30 now, I was diagnosed with a non specific learning disorder as a child and diagnosed with ADHD-I in my early 20's. 

The last two sessions I've had with the psychiatrist have left me feeling unsettled for days afterwards. During sessions she fixes me with this prolonged silent stare. According to google this is a technique to impel the client to speak more- however it just makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. 

I've read about the idea of transference and rationally I can understand why she might try to make me feel uncomfortable with her gaze- but everytime she's done the staring thing I get overwhelmed with mah feeeels and have an even harder time communicating anything. It feels like she's sitting there judging me.

I've gather that I'm not an ideal patient as I'm very uncomfortable exposing my vulnerabilities to either the psychologist or psychiatrist. It must be hard for them if I give them little to work with. 

Do you have any advice on what I can do to improve this situation?"
132,From un/sub conscious to consciousness,"Is this the process of awareness?

I am physically becoming more and more anxious. It's not that anything has changed in recent times too much other than my perception and how I've decided to respond to things.
Where I would have been despondent and feeble before,. I'm feeling a surge of unsettling energy that wants OUT, but I don't know what to do with it so it's manifesting as physical neuroses; OCD, anxiety, boredom, dissociation, etc

Consider Google Glass.

Imagine all the wearables to monitor your sleep, exercise. 

It could monitor *everything*. 

It could send data to your psychiatrist, 24/7/365. 

There is so much data that's important for bipolar.

(This would even be useful for all people, but particularly psychiatric patients.) 

It could even ""intervene"" to exhort you, maybe with self-recorded exhortations in your own voice that you recorded in a higher-energy/higher-mood state, which might be more effective. 

It could even coerce you and zap you, and force you to do X/Y/Z around the clock, for the sake of your health.

136,Do you guys care about the public perception of your field?,"I personally hate psychiatry and psychiatrists but how does negative public opinions of your field affect you, if it does?"
137,Am I manic?,"I just got into a fight with a roommate/ friends with benefits. 

He made it very clear at the beginning that I'm nothing more than a friend. I have a past abusive relationship that I told him about, so when he gets really mad and says stupid stuff, he would always apologize but I said it was fine because I was used to it, and it wasn't abusive at all.

 We just got into a fight over something small. I was trying to tell him something and I led it with something I mentioned from earlier, but he never said anything earlier so I didn't know if he heard me and I repeated it. 

He then said that I already repeated myself three times and to shut up and leave him alone, to which I responded how am I supposed to know if you heard me if you give no sign of acknowledgement?
 His argument was he doesn't have to answer to anybody. 
I tried to state that he's not answering to me, I'm simply saying if he would respond I would be able to acknowledge if he heard me.

Anyways it turned into a long drawn-out fight, with a lot of stops and starts and a variation of topics. when I get extremely mad I tend to freeze in a certain spot and went to myself until I calm down. Twice I actually managed to stop arguing and calm down and be quiet, but then he would say something related to one of the topics which started up again. All this is going on all he's playing his video game, half the time he's acting pissed, half the time he's acting like he's making fun of me and it's hilarious. 

By the third time I was no longer able to calm down quietly, I essentially sat in the same spot on the bed which was behind him talking to myself. Part of it was at him but it was primarily at myself to try and verbalize my feelings quietly, calmly, while at the same time trying to pretend that he was listening. 

At this point I did not care if he heard me but I was too far gone to calm down the regular way. 

If I get mad about something and have no way to vent I will hold on to it and feel like y skin is crawling wit the pent up emotions. Meanwhile he started playing the game with one of his friends online talking shit about me sitting there talking, and I suddenly couldn't stop talking if I wanted to

I don't know how else to describe it, this hasn't happened since I used to get into fights with my abusive ex-boyfriend. 

I finally got off the bed talking to myself, away from him. I got in the shower, I was just talking, non-stop I couldn't stop talking. I was just mumbling and saying words that didn't even really relate to one another just stringing words and sentences together. 

Even after I got out of the shower and he tried to apologize I just couldn't stop talking at all. And I think the stress of not being able to stop made it worse. It was like I was on a rant. 

When I was younger my mother had me diagnosed bipolar, I went back to the doctor once I have became an adult and actually said I am depressed and not bipolar. 

I just have to know is this a sign of manic or is this a common way people tend to vent? 

I finally have been able to stop talking, for the last twenty minute it was nothing but a mantra of the same phrases, which now I can't even remember.

Is there anything about this anywhere, do you know what it is or what it's called? I only get like that when I'm so pissed I can't calm down."
138,Does Zoloft impact focus?,"I started taking Zoloft at 25mg, up to 50, now 100 and I feel like my focus has been everywhere. I certainly feel more distracted that when I wasn’t on the meds and really only noticed the difference in focus once I was on 50 mg for a few weeks. I asked my psychiatrist and she said Zoloft should improve concentration? But online I saw a side effect could be reduced focus. So what’s right? I do have adhd as well and am not taking anything for that right now"

Apparently I have comorbid ADHD that keeps me non-functional during periods of good mood. 

The two disorders creates huge uncertainty: even if I can use meds like Lamotrigine to fix my mood and stay ""euthymic,"" I still need to get a good response from ADHD meds in order to be functional. 

Without that response (from ADHD meds), I will be like 60 and still have no functionality. 

In fact, I will have no functionality forever. 

What happens to patients who have no functionality? 

What do they do with their lives? 

What is the point of their existence and how do they enjoy their lives or make their lives meaningful?"

There are services out there like 7 Cups that offer online therapy, but I haven't heard of any that exclusively utilize licensed clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.

Does such a thing exist, either for patients who have serious concerns about their privacy or otherwise feel unable to verbally share information face to face? On a broader, semi-related note, what would you have a patient do if they desired treatment or were in need of treatment but either a) had severe anxieties surrounding issues of privacy and personal information (possibly due to some kind of psychosis/paranoia or other serious anxiety disorder) or b) felt physically unable to express themselves or verbally share information face to face with another person (either due to some kind of trauma or a related issue of severe anxiety about privacy and personal information). Is there nothing that can be done for these patients? It seems like a catch 22 - the very thing they would be seeking help for is the same thing that might make therapy impossible for them to follow through with at the moment. It appears that the only solution is for these patients to become well *enough* on their own to seek treatment, while those who are unable to bridge this gap on their own will go without."

I am 23 years old, female, and I have some previous diagnoses by a psychiatrist including Major Depressive disorder, PTSD, and a vague ""Mood disorder"" diagnosis I never really understood and was unable to ask about before I stopped seeing them due to lack of insurance. 

I took Lexapro for a while, and have Hydroxyzine 25mg for at-will anxiety needs. I don't take it often, I have an aversion to medication because my mother abused anxiety and pain meds throughout my childhood. Hence being prescribed basically Benadryl for anxiety.

My question is about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I understand how it works, in relation to intrusive thoughts that don't go away unless a repeated behavior is carried out. I feel like I get stuck on the intrusive thoughts, and they continue to repeat until I tell myself out loud to shut up and think of something else, or start reading something. The thoughts themselves range from benign preoccupations with conversations I have had or want to have with someone, to the typical violent urges like what if I drove into traffic. The benign ones are the most prevalent, to the point of involuntarily saying things out loud. When I am alone, I am constantly talking to myself. If I don't, I focus on these thoughts to the point of dissociation. I recently started driving and if I don't constantly sing or narrate my drive through traffic I lose my focus and that is incredibly dangerous for me.


Does OCD ""develop?"" is there a similar issue to OCD I should look into? This is getting worse as I get older, and more embarrassing. I have never felt ""crazy"" before but I fear as I go on and progress my increasingly stressful premed education, I am going to burn out and lose my mind. I feel like if I knew what it was, I could start handling things before I get much worse, so thanks again for any help!"
145,Psych meds cause broken bones?,"Hi
I have had severe anxiety for as long as I can remember. I finally got given pregablin which has been the only thing that works. The problem is I got really depressed on it alone so got given venlafaxine as well. I only use the pregablin to the suggested dose. 

Also no comments about why am I on pregablin for anxiety in the UK it is recommended as a third line treatment for anxiety. 

The issue is that I am 25 and have never broken a bone but all of a sudden completely shattered my right leg to the point that the bones did not knit back together for a whole year. I thought that was a one of accident. I kicked my own leg while Ice skating. This is something I have done loads as I used to be a figure skater. The people in a and e actually thought I’d been in a car crash when they saw my xrays. I ended up having surgery For it too. 

Fast forward 10 months and I have now broken my other ankle going down a children’s inflatable slide again nothing that I think is dangerous I’m not even sure what happened to make or break it this time. 

I did mention to my orthopaedic surgeon could the pregablin (or maybe venlafaxine) have caused this  and she has absolutely no interest at all and just cut me off mid sentence. I just don’t feel like I did much to either leg, I have done way worse before and nothing has ever happened. 

I had blood tests regarding vit d and calcium levels all were ok. 

Could either drug have caused this?

149,"Does ADHD lead to ""self-alienation?""","Suppose that the PFC: 

- plays a role (the major role? how much role) in self-awareness

- plays a major role in autobiographical memory (does it?) 

- plays a major role in the creation of identity (again, does it?)

- regulates/organizes your social behavior/connections (your social world?)

- regulates/organizes your present actions to bring them in line with your long-term goals that you want to achieve

Suppose that your PFC is utterly shattered (""ADHD""), as I believe mine to be, back to childhood. 

Shouldn't ADHD utterly shatter your sense of identity? 

Just go through each bullet-point above, and think about how it relates to identity. 

If you don't act in accordance with long-term goals, doesn't that shut down any meaning that you might generate in your life, insofar as meaning is created through the pursuit of the long-term dreams/goals/objectives that define your life and define your achievements? How does that affect meaning? How does that affect identity? 

What about the social point? Don't we create identity/meaning within a social context? How does social isolation factor into this?

I would feel acute mortification afterward, and try to somehow deal with that in my head. 

* * * 

I heard that there are genuine dissociative disorders, and I don't think that that's what I mean. 

I do feel that there's ""no person in there"" regarding myself. 

It's all shattered. 

I'm alienated from my actions/thoughts/past. 

I don't think it's ""dissociation,"" though. 

I think it might relate more to the bullet-points given above.

This will sound way out of left field, but I've always been abnormal in my inability to organize stories, when I had to write stories for school.

My stories would often just be weird ramblings/meanderings, very abstract/strange, without any clear structure like the teacher wanted me to do.

I always wonder whether people create stories about themselves, and how this relates to identity, though I'm not sure whether any dubious link can be drawn between story-construction (like in school) and the actual autobiographical stories that we contract. 

I think that in ADHD working-memory is shattered, and you can't ""maintain the thread,"" so your stories/essays may lack structure; I also recall that my paragraphs would literally physically go all over the place as I clearly failed to plan ahead and make enough space for them on the page. 

* * * 

I get intrusive thoughts all the time. 

I usually say an expletive out loud in order to silence them. 

These thoughts just arise. 

I guess that I'm ""alienated"" from myself due to this as well; because I'm alienated from my own thoughts. 

Maybe that's overdramatic, and I don't know the role the intrusive/unwanted/undesired thoughts/thought-processes plays in all this. 

It reminds me of the purple box in Figure 1 of **[this](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Christoff-et-al.-2016.pdf)** paper.

ADHD is supposed to shatter that purple box, for whatever that's worth. 

* * * 

I also feel that my *non*-intrusive thoughts are unhealthy/warped/strange, but I don't know whether I would go so far as to say that I have a ""thought disorder,"" since that sounds extreme."
150,Study from 2 years ago says SSRIs cause a 33% increase in mortality. Thoughts?,"Came across this study and the many accompanying news articles:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28903117/

I read this article that tears this study apart for many reasons: https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/09/15/no-antidepressants-will-not-kill-you-crap-study-could-11834

But to me, having a sample size of over 300,000 makes the results seem somewhat valid. That it increases the risk of death.

I wanted to get some doctors thoughts on this. Is there some validity to this study despite its faults?"
151,Can you have adderall prescribed PRN instead of scheduled?,"I know this is a weird question but I was reading an AMA by a psychologist today and he said he had ADHD and was prescribed adderall PRN instead of scheduled. He was saying that he had ADHD and only took adderall when he needed it to write articles/chapters (and to do reddit AMA's lol). 

My question is, is this normal or was the psychologist just making stuff up? I would think if you truly had ADHD, you would need to take the medication every day. And if you only need it to write articles and book chapters, you're really using it as performance enhancement just like college students who abuse it, rather than truly to treat ADHD."
152,Issues with Mirtazapine (only ever at night),"[25, M] [Weight: 195lbs, Height 6’1]
I've been on 45mg of mirtazapine for around 5 months and while it's the only antidepressant that's had any noticeable effect, if I ever stay awake for longer than 18 or so hours I experience quick exhaustion and terrifying hallucinations and difficulty sleeping (dehydration, excessive sweating, a feeling of almost an electric current moving around my body). Before taking the medication I would be fine staying up 24-30 hours without any (obvious) complications or difficulty.

I'm not sure if this is a normal side effect or something to do with taking the medication at irregular times,I'm taking it consistently but occasionally my days are longer than normal and I might only take 6 doses a week due to strange sleep schedules like being awake 16 hours and asleep 12.  

It's still several weeks before I see my doctor and since my previous psychologist left I'm seeing someone new and have no idea how to ask them questions like this, but is there anything to do other than taper off and try getting something else when I see her?  Are there ways of dealing with these specific side effects without losing access to what might be the only thing effective for me?"
153,What medication could I get for OCD and ADHD comorbidity?,"[M,19] So am I currently on lexapro 20mg and wellbutrin XL 150mg (both generic I think). Lexapro has helped majorly with my anxiety and helped my depression somewhat. Wellbutrin XL has helped with depression even more, but it has made my anxiety worse. I’m only on day 6 of Wellbutrin so I’m gonna give it a little bit more time, but really I think I’m gonna go off it because tons of people on the internet say it makes anxiety worse for as long as you are on it. So, now to the question of this post: I believe it is possible that I have OCD and ADHD. Is there any combination of medication that can treat this? Is there any combination of medication that can treat this while I stay on the lexapro?

155,"What are the stats on what % of bipolar patients manage to achieve 100% (or near-100%) euthymia? I.e., they have no symptoms?","I just saw a doctor today who said that ***very*** few patients who

- obey their med-prescriptions

- put in the effort regarding behavioral changes

will experience any symptoms at all. 

Virtually all of them can achieve (virtually) 100% euthymia, as long as they constrain themselves, and make sure not to travel to China or something (where light is different). 

This surprised me enormously. 

I thought that people would cycle no matter *what* they did, no matter *how* much effort they put in, with (*maybe*) some rare exceptions who got lucky. 

He suggested that 100% euthymia (or near to it) is within reach for all who put in the effort. 

I'm curious about the data on that. 

* * * 

When my prescriber says that she has bipolar patients working as doctors/lawyers/etc., she must have meant that they are symptom-free patients who don't have symptoms and don't cycle. 

That would make sense. 

I had always assumed that she meant that symptomatic people (who were actually cycling) were trying to hold down careers. 

* * * 

This is an irrelevant tidbit, but do you guys know any research-papers that might align with my doctor's comment below? 

- bipolar people (even when euthymic, even before any serious sign of mood-episodes) have a limited ability to react to stressors

- people's emotional reactions to life vary

- ""healthy"" people have a diff response, congruent to stress

- bipolar people have limited responses: a few at the high end, a few at the low end, and nothing in-between

This apparently manifests as a form of emotional dysregulation. 

Do you guys know what research my doctor might have been referring to?"

157,Going to a doctor after years of not being on medication with schizoaffective disorder.,"So I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder when I went to my first psychiatrist when I was 18. I’ll be 28 in less than a month. My first meeting, I ended up having to sign a paper saying I would return to the psych ward within 24 hours or the police would come get me. My paranoia started when I was 9. My hallucinations started when I was 13. Anyways. I haven’t been to a psychiatrist or on medication for some years now. Antipsychotics don’t work on me. The doctor I did have quit a few years ago and wouldn’t give me my medical records because she said she didn’t want a new doctor to have a “biased opinion”. How she ran things, I wouldn’t be surprised if she had any records at all. I have my insurance papers that show what I was billed for and the diagnosis reason but that’s it. I have a new psychiatrist appointment next week and I’m horribly nervous. I’ve already rescheduled once. The first doctor I went to, it shocked me that I was basically forced into the hospital. It was a traumatic week in the hospital. They threatened to send me to a state hospital when I asked for an AMA form. So now I’m worried this new doctor is basically going to repeat my first doctor and force me to go to a hospital because I’m not on any medication. I’m going because my depression is affecting my schooling. I just can’t focus. My hallucinations and everything, they’re just.. “normal” to me. My mom told me my main visual hallucination was my guardian angel and the voices were dead people talking. It sounds ridiculous now but growing up, it seemed rational. I know they’re hallucinations but I’m used to them. It’s just life. 

What are the chances this new doctor will force me inpatient because I’m not on medication?"

162,Lots of questions about Bupropion HCL XL (Wellbutrin),"[19, M] [Weight: 150lbs, Height 5’11] So I just started taking Bupropion HCL XL at 150mg once a day. I know that when it is at 300mg it is used to treat ADD/ADHD. So on the very first day I took it, I noticed my attention span increase significantly for a very short amount of time. It was also during this time period that I felt the motivation aspect of the drug was working best. On Day 2 nothing really happened except side effects. Fast forward to the present, Day 4, still nothing except side effects. So I’m guessing that the motivation is going to hit in a couple days. A couple questions now: Will the heightened attention come back when the drug kicks in? Is the heightened attention span that i experienced on Day 1 the normal attention span for people who don’t have ADD/ADHD? I have not been diagnosed with ADD, but it has been briefly discussed as a possibility with my therapist. I was prescribed this drug as an add on to lexapro 20mg for my depression. So, if I don’t have ADD, am I sort of cheating at life with this drug in terms of the attention span in the same way that lots of college kids take adderall to study for finals? Or does the heightened attention span mean that I do have ADD because it shouldn’t effect people that don’t have ADD? Last question: I also have struggled with somewhat severe anxiety; how long does it typically take for Wellbutrin induced anxiety to go away or to be taken away by the lexapro?

163,Why did my delusions suddenly disappear?,"(edit: personal info removed e.g age etc) Medication I'm taking: Quetiapine 150mg (1 per night), Mirtazipine 15mg (1 per night). 

Backstory: I had cannabis induced psychosis twice a few years ago (one year, then the following year). I was hospitalised on both those occasions. I've not touched cannabis for a year now. 

I started keeping a diary when I started to experience delusions again this year (it started in may but was not often, like only a few times I wrote in May). Then in June I was struggling with sleeping, not being able to sleep at all some nights but also having some delusions like my thoughts could be read and that family members were throwing subliminal shots at me with the things they would say (these were very stressful). 

Also I don't think I wrote it down but I was on Mirtazipine 30mg around this time then I started halving it (I don't know on what month though) 

In July I was still struggling with sleeping, but I didn't write in my journal that much so I assume it wasn't that bad with the delusions.

In August I was definitely struggling a lot. One particular day I wrote:
 ""need more alone time. feel claustrophobic"" and also ""mind being read?"" ""cat is spying, watching me, recording & streaming"", ""drugged?"" (i thought a family member had spiked my drink). ""my speaking is being analysed"", ""sociopath analysing me"", ""playing dumb"" (i thought a family member was a sociopath trying to mess with me but also playing dumb) 

Another august day i wrote ""accidental forgetfulness purposeful""
A week after that (August) I wrote (about a family member) ""was getting the evil eye today. disliked the eye contact. Feel like I need more alone time again. I dislike when people can't admit they were wrong. Stressed""

The next day i wrote ""off and on. it's making me feel uncomfortable and prefer being alone. tried to argue the thoughts but in the moment feels very real. need to speak to a doctor or someone that isn't family""

A couple days after that I thought a dream that I had was a message from God (Don't want to go into detail)

Then I didn't write again until the beginning of September. write about having a good mood and that I don't feel the need to a see a doctor anymore and that I haven't been writing down my bad days. 

Couple days after that I did a long writing about a family member trying to make me paranoid on purpose on that day (but it's long and I don't want to go into detail). Same day I watched a film with that family member and I had the ""they can read my thoughts"" pretty much the entire time of watching it. I remember hated watching it, I wanted to stop but also felt like I had to? Hard to explain that part but basically like it was like the family member was showing me that film for a reason but not a good reason (don't want to go into detail)

Day after that wrote ""felt fine today"". A week after I wrote ""haven't slept today, first time in a while"" then I wrote about some ""delusions"" (don't want to go into detail as this post is too long already)

Sorry for making this post so long and maybe vague (i didn't put all my journal entries here as they go until october and tried to shorten them as much as possible) 

So I guess my question is I feel like since the beginning of October, I've been feeling pretty good with like no delusions (I haven't been writing in my journal either really) So why did my delusions disappear suddenly?

Also, I google'd ""why did my delusions disappear?"" and a site came up about ""malingering"" (this is the first time I've ever heard of the phrase) and basically they said in it that if delusions suddenly disappear then the person was faking it. I know what I went through was very real but it did make me question myself because I am feeling so good right now. Can you tell me your thoughts on this?"
164,Do the “brain fog” side effects of topiramate affect only the retrieval of information or the encoding of it as well?,"One of the more common side effects I’ve noticed about this medication (aside from the weight loss) is the issue of brain fog and slowed cognition. On higher dosages, some report having difficulties thinking of a particular word when speaking or remembering pieces of information they need to recall.

How do you, as a Psychiatrist, determine the difference between delusion and lying without obtaining collateral history ?

When is it necessary for a Psychiatrist to confirm whether or not their patient is being truthful ?

If a patient asks you to write a letter on their behalf, would you take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy/validity of information provided to you by your patient ?

My perspective is that if you, in your capacity as a Psychiatrist, write a letter on your patient’s behalf, there is a duty of care/due diligence component which requires you to confirm certain information. 

Let’s say that you didn’t address the letter to a specific person but used the ‘To Whom it May Concern:’ line. Would you consider that the letter could potentially end up being publicized, maybe used in Court ?In consideration of that wouldn’t it be in your best interests to make sure the information you share is factual otherwise you might risk public and professional embarrassment, even job loss ? 

What would you do if you were quietly provided with irrefutable proof that your patient had entirely misrepresented the facts to you ? Would you confront them and retract your letter ?"

She prescribed me .5mg risperdal (i also take 600mg trileptal, 150mg wellbutrin, and 60mg cymbalta) So far I feel a little more calm but still am not sure if my beliefs are real or not.

167,Can I get a thorough diagnosis? (F/27),"F/27 120lbs Caucasian 

I’ve been dealing with mental illness since I was 10 years old.  Diagnosed with add in childhood, and depression/gad in my teens.  I’ve never received a diagnosis from a specialist in mental health, just my gp.  Every medication I’ve tried has never done anything for me (them being antidepressants, currently doing Wellbutrin for around 4 years,) besides unrelated birth control (tri- linyah).

I feel as though my depression and anxiety may be a result of undiagnosed mental condition/s that need to be addressed rather than what they bring me.  I can identify symptoms with various conditions ranging from schizophrenia to bipolar, ocd, (even autism) and more.  I’ve seen a few psychologists through my early teen and adult years, and never got anywhere just talking about my feelings (and one was just nutters).  One made a connection with schizoaffective disorder, but no official diagnosis.  I’ve seen a psychiatrist once to adjust my medication, and went home with pamphlets on ocd.  At the time I was dealing with severe hypochondria.

It bothers me that I may not be getting treated for the right thing as I’m still struggling in everyday life and it’s getting harder.  I have an appointment with my gp to get a referral.  I basically want to go in and ask if I can please have a diagnosis to know what’s wrong with me...can I do that?  I don’t want to waste their time."
168,"Is there any theoretical feasibility of two SSRI’s, one at an abnormally low dosage (like 2.5 mg of Zoloft)?","I know that taking two SSRIs leads to serotonin syndrome. As far as I know, this happens because the SSRI’s magnify each other’s effects. Likewise, it seems that this is all true even when both medications are at their lowest therapeutic doses.

My question: Theoretically speaking, couldn’t a low-moderate therapeutic dose of one SSRI and a microdose (a fraction of the lowest therapeutic  dose) work?

If two SSRI’s at therapeutic doses cause serotonin syndrome, then it seems like they are doing their job (increasing serotonin), just doing it *too well*. Scaling the factor of one SSRI down by a *ton* seems like it might work in principle.

Has any psychiatrist raised this question, even if only theoretically? I understand that this might be too risky in practice, even if it works (easy to OD, etc)—but surely I’m not the only one to have thought of it."

174,What is known about medication-induced bipolar?,"This is such a fascinating topic to me. 

I had some depression in my teen years. Nothing extreme. Nothing clinical. It was a *cakewalk* compared to serious clinical depression. I can barely call it ""depression"" with a straight face after what I've now been through. I would *love* to have to deal with those teenage mood-states, compared to the *genuine* clinical depression that I've now experienced, and the serious periodic episodes (not inpatient-level, but I can't function, can't go to work, and just try to ""wait it out"" with random distractions till it subsides) that I now face. 

I went to get treated for SRDD (""ADHD""). Mood-disorders were not at *all* on my radar. I wish that I could go back to those days; it was so much simpler/better to not even know what bipolar was and not even think about it. 

Something triggered mania. I think it was the Cymbalta alone that did it, or the psychostimulants in concert with the Cymbalta. Either way, I would be surprised if Cymbalta weren't implicated. (Note: It's not so clear to me that I should have even been prescribed Cymbalta; long story.) 

Anyway, the med-induced mania triggered a big conversation once I finally got off the roller-coaster of mania/depression/mania/depression. 

**Do I have bipolar?** Does the brain recover? Does it ""settle"" after the chaos? 

Or do you cycle forever? 

I would love to know the science on this. 

It's fascinating to imagine that the brain (so plastic, so resilient) doesn't have a way to ""settle,"" and that the brain will instead cycle forever, and that the person had been done serious permanent damage (that they will face for their whole lifetime) thanks to the med-induced mania that started this whole (lifelong) destabilization.

This happened to me at age 25. Someone might be quick to point out that bipolar onset is usually right around that age; maybe this was inevitable, even without the med-induced destabilization?  

How can we ever know?"
175,"In cases where bipolar patients increase their lithium-dose above the stipulated safe limit for the human kidney (which is obviously a bad thing, and can land you in the hospital), do the patients' bipolar symptoms tend to improve relative to their bipolar symptoms at lower lithium doses?","I'm curious about the data on this. 

Does going above the stipulated lithium-limit (which, I want to stress, is dangerous/bad/harmful, and can land you in the hospital due to kidney problems) actually improve bipolar patients' bipolar symptoms? 

How significant is the improvement (in bipolar symptoms), in the rare cases where patients increase their dosage beyond the kidney-safe limit? 

I assume that there is no data to suggest significant improvement, otherwise this would be a well-known ""tragedy"" of medicine, and everybody would talk about how a leading cause of disability in the world (bipolar disorder) ***could*** be significantly (dramatically?) improved, if only higher lithium-doses happened to be more tolerable to the human kidney. 

That would be a well-known frustration/bottleneck in human medicine, if true."
176,"How does bipolar relate to ""ADHD?"" What does psychiatry/neuroscience/neuroanatomy tell us about the relation between self-regulation and bipolar when the patient is ""euthymic?""","My understanding is that what we call ""ADHD"" really ought to be called ""SRDD""/""EFDD"" (it's about self-regulation or executive function, much more profound/global in its impairments than mere ""attention"" or ""hyperactivity,"" the former misleading because attention-*regulation* is what's impaired, and the latter misleading too because motoric hyperactivity is not always present in the first place and by adulthood doesn't even carry any diagnostic value). 

This is all according to Dr. Russell Barkley, whom I have a lot of respect for, despite some minor issues about things like neuroanatomy. Overall, I consider Barkley a champion for people with self-regulation problems, and even the neuroimagers I corresponded with concurred with that basic assessment (that he was a champion), even while they pointed out how off-the-mark his neuroanatomy was, at least in the cases that I explored with them.

Barkley says that DSM will not change the name anytime soon, and cites lego-political ramifications if that change were ever to occur (protections/entitlements are enshrined in law under the ""ADHD"" term). 

I just refer to SRDD. 

* * *

I've had SRDD symptoms going way back. I remember that they got really bad in like Grade 11 when I needed to do homework in order to get through courses like math. That's when my peers really left me behind. 

I had some depression, anxiety, and OCD in my teen years. 

All of this largely dissipated by my 20s, and left my symptomatology *screaming* SRDD alone, with not much else on the radar at all. 

It was all about SRDD; that was the symptomatology. 

Stimulants failed me. Everything failed me. 

I ended up in the hospital due to Cymbalta, I think, which I might have been given without proper justification/logic/reason.  

Mania (from Cymbalta?). Depression. Mania (from Lamotrigine). Depression. 

It was a wild ride. 

I'm still experiencing periodic elevations (minor ones; I'd be shocked if anyone called it hypomania; I don't think it meets the bar for that), and periodic depressions (pretty serious; I can't got to work; very impairing). 

Here's the weird part. At 900mg Lithium (one month ago, I made the increase) I felt like my SRDD was ""cured"" (or partially ""cured"") for the first time ever. Maybe the best functioning that I've had in my adult life. I would have to go *way* back to find a time when I felt that well-regulated, and maybe I wouldn't even find a time for all I know. 

It was an impressive response in terms of self-regulation. 

This is how I framed the ""puzzle"" to a friend below.

* * * 


I seem to have mood problems in addition to self-regulation problems. 

I had a brief window (4 days) where my self-regulation problems were significantly reduced. 
This happened when I increased my Lithium dose. 
The obvious idea is that my mood problems cause my self-regulatory problems, or else why did a Lithium increase work wonders for self-regulation? 

However, my self-regulation problems long predate my mood-problems, at least as far as I know. 
This is an interesting puzzle. 
**The bipolar seems to cause the self-regulation problems, but the self-regulation problems were present at least 10 years before bipolar came onto the scene.**

Just something to think about, that puzzles me about my diagnosis."
177,Chemically induced bipolar or denial?,"Hello I have had an interesting year health wise and the copays are adding up so I would love some opinions that don't cost me $100 a visit (especially being as how im not sure how I feel about the opinions I already have) . I am a 27 y.o. female don't really know why you would need the other information...


I have had issues with anxiety and depression since I was a teen, always pretty high functioning though. The older I got the harder it became to manage and I did end up trying a variety of medications on and off over the years. Last year my mother died and the grief drove me start antidepressants again (first seralitine, then Wellbutrin then finally effexor) it worked pretty well for a few months. Then in February I was DX with thyroid cancer and had it removed. I did not handle the stress of it the best and my depression and stress got worse. While I was in the hospital recovering from surgery I was put on suscide watch for failing my intake PHQ9. The staff psychiatrist was under the impression that I needed to be stabilized due to my usual therapist suspecting I was bipolar. He put me on Lithium and increased my effexor. Over the next week I found out my cancer had spread to my lymphnodes  and I was going to try to treat it was high dose canabis oil. I also take Adderall for narcolepsy but that week I noticed that it effected me very differently.  My mood became gradually more elevated ending with me having a paranoid manic episode. 


I ended up going to two different inpatient hospitals where they took me off my antidepressants and started a variety of mood stabilizers (4 different ones in about a month). One place DX me bipolar the other schizoaffective. I ended up trying to see a psychiatrist as an outpatient the Dr.s nurse took me off what I was taking from the hospital and put me on a very low antipsychotic (saphris) and told me it was for sleep. A few weeks later I decided I wanted to be able to sleep for myself (worried about being dependant on something for sleep) so for about three months I have been off all my meds.


I only now really start to feel like I have my brain back. I feel rather depressive still but not like I was in the hospital, the brain fog is mostly gone and I haven't had any major maina symptoms either. I want to try to treat my depression but im not sure if im bipolar or depressed with a shit ton of chemicals going through me at the time. 


There are more details I could give of you want but what I really want help with is if I treat my depression could it trigger maina (one doc thought it was partly the effexor that caused it) is it possible that my maina was just a chemical induced fluke? I spent the first few months thinking I was crazy and nothing in my life would be the same. Now my brain feels completely different and im not sure how to proceed."
178,Why do I keep getting images in my brain of a pair of sciassors cutting my tongue while I'm awake?,"Hi! I was redirected here from r/AskDocs

Bit of context:

\- This usually happens while I'm watching TV, laying down on the couch by the end of the day.

\- I almost never recall my dreams. I mention this because it feels like something I might have dreamt, since I'm pretty sure I haven't seen it in any movie, or game, or anything else. The image is too brief to determine if it's my own tongue or a random one, but it automatically sets off an ""anguish/physical feeling"" around my tongue (sorry, English isn't my first language and I think I'd have trouble describing it even in Spanish).

\- Image pops out of nowhere and has no relation to what I'm watching, or listening to. Happens when I'm basically doing nothing.

\- Has happenned several times over the past weeks, almost always in the same context but in others too.

\- Has happenned mostly while high on weed, but also while totally sober. I'm aware that this is the most obvious answer but I've been a recreational and occassional user for some years now and I've never experienced anything similar. Not a heavy user.

\- 30 YO Male, overweight, smokes cigarrettes, eats reasonably well (Mediterranean), barely drinks (less than 4 beers/month if any). 

- Had depression and anxiety issues in the past (around 10 years ago), but I never experienced anything similar back then.

This is clearly not an emergency or even too serious but it is starting to worry me as it has happenned a few times now.



Thanks a lot!"

180,Should I seek help? What could be wrong with me?,"Age: 18

Sex: M

Height: 183cm

Weight: 112kg

Race: Middle Eastern 

Medications: Zomig 1mg PRN

Recreational drugs: Nicotine




to preface this, I have seen multiple psychiatrists before. The experience was terrible as I was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia by the first one, treated with anti psychotics and benzos (tried Zyprexa, Abilify (IM), Haldol, Invega (IM), Latuda, Ativan and Xanax). This was all based on how my fear of being abandoned and abused was considered a delusion, and a whole case was built up around that.


The second doctor I went to made me go through a second diagnosis process, as it seemed I was unresponsive to the medicine. my condition kept declining, medicine didn't seem to work, but no psychosis could be observed. it was eventually changed out to PD-NOS with more diagnoses forthcoming as we went through the process. I lied and said I was following the chart I was given on how to wean off dosages (was on Haldol 10mg every 12h and 2 mg Ativan PRN at that point) but at that point I stopped cold turkey and after the widrawals went away I felt like I was feeling okay, not good, but okay. so I stopped seeing a doctor and have not seen one for about 20 months.


During this time I was told by my dad I had been diagnosed with asperger's as a child, and that my mother pulled me out of psychiatric care due to her not believing that I could be on the spectrum due to ""not being retarded"" in her words. Regardless I don't like her and I'd rather not elaborate on that point as she abused me heavily as a child. I thought it'd be relevant to mention that I could possibly have asperger's.


To describe how I feel right now, I have extremely vivid nightmares of being left alone and abandonded by friends, family and loved ones. I come off as clingy  and I get very upset and depressed when someone decides to stop talking to me. (gets worse the closer I am to them.) Right now I am unable to do much, I am a high school drop out with a desire to get my education done and work a job to live away from my family as I dislike them and the way they treat me. The issue is that I can't get myself to get back into the system because it's overwhelming to me. I used to have everything under control and a plan in motion but it all went bad when some of my closest friends were upset at me for a petty reason and I thought they were gonna not be my friends anymore. I kept it to myself but I was sobbing in bed for a few days, and any mention of them would make me remember how they were upset at me and it really felt like that was a good enough reason for them to leave me. my friends are still here and I occasionally talk to them but they're now busy with university and such so I feel unbearably lonely and I default to this fear of them forgetting about me since I'm not around them or spending time with them. either way, another thing that really affects me is when people I've grown a liking towards get angry, rather than having a normal reaction, I just get really afraid of them and can't help breaking down and crying. 


I don't know what this could be, I have a clue as to why I'm like this now, but I'd rather not open up about childhood abuse. I also am afraid to ask a doctor only to be diagnosed with something horrible that turns out to be untrue and be involuntarily hospitalized over it. Currently I am not suicidal neither do I want to hurt myself in any way, I am past those days and I do not plan to do anything in that regard as I feel comfortable enough with how I am now.


What could be going on? Should I seek help for it despite having no desire to hurt myself or others? Sorry if I sound incoherent, typed this in a hurry on my phone.

183,Allergic reaction to Lexapro?,"Hello everyone, overall healthy and active 22F here, 5'4, 135lbs, on no medications.

I'll try to be as detailed as possible. I just graduated undergrad for pre med & have typically been a strong person emotionally. Never really struggled with anxiety or depression my entire high school/college life. After I graduated, i started to feel the stress of studying for my MCAT as well as financial burdens of loans and pressure from my family. The anxiety was very overwhelming at times, and started to make me feel a roller coaster of emotions. For this reason, I went in to my PCP and told him about my concerns. He stated that he thought I was just an ""anxious person"" but really didn't need to be on meds. Additionally, I've been having a lot of problems with sleep. I feel as if it's extremely hard to fall asleep and stay asleep (I am constantly tossing and turning) and this started my last year of college. I explained to him that I tried going to the gym, meditating, and doing other forms of relaxing but the overwhelming feeling of the ""anxiousness"" is underlying. We decided to move forward with 10mg of Lexapro.

After 3 weeks in, I was waking up with itchy spots on my arms, legs, and hips which resembled mosquito bites. I thought there was a bug biting me in my room! However, the itchy bumps were coming and going, every other day sometimes and I would typically wake up with a new bump.

When I went in for my 6 week follow up to my PCP, I explained to him that I felt a lot better on the Lexapro. My emotional state just felt at a ""constant line,"" with not many fluctuations. However, I mentioned to him that my sleep is still awful and that I have been getting these bumps/rashes. After I showed it to him, he freaked out and told me to discontinue the Lexapro. He said this is a rash from being allergic to the medication. He then proceeded to say that he thinks I talk very fast and might have ADHD instead of anxiety.

To summarize, this was upsetting because I am studying for my MCAT and feel as if my focus is off since now I am anxious about the side effects of weening off. I did not want to tamper with the medication during my studying, but I feel as if I need to see a psychiatrist now and think something else must be wrong with me. It is also upsetting that he didn't try to find a medication that was a better fit for me, but pushed me off to see someone else right away.

Basically, would being allergic to Lexapro mean that another SSRI might not work as well? Sorry if this was very long I wanted to be as detailed as possible. Thanks in advance!"

I’m 21, 5’5”, 109lbs, Assigned F at Birth but identify as nonbinary and present androgynously. I’m based in the UK if that’s important ?

Most of my diagnoses are due to trauma I suffered as a young child (I made a post in /adultchildren recently about that if you want more info regarding that).

Current Meds:
- Naproxen 500mg x2 / day
- Omeprazole 20mg / day
- Duloxetine 60mg / day
- Buprenorphine 5mcg / week
- Folic Acid / day
- Vitamin D3 + Calcium 1000IU / day
- Iron / day
- Co-codamol 8/500mg / prn
- Diazepam 2mg / prn
- Zopiclone 7mg / prn
- Depo-Provera injection / 12 weekly
Current Diagnoses (from various psychiatrists over the last ~9 years or so):

PHYSICAL
- Osteogenesis Imperfecta (I)
- Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome / ME
- IBS

MENTAL
- Gender Dysphoria
- Borderline Personality Disorder
- Avoidant Personality Disorder
- Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder
- ASD / Aspergers (high functioning)
- ADHD
- Depression (severe)
- Generalised Anxiety Disorder
- Anorexia Nervosa (atypical)
- cPTSD

So, obviously i’m a complex patient. I’ve been in various therapies and have seen everyone from social workers to psychotherapists to psychiatrists over the course of my life. My mental health got bad around age 11, and prior to that, my only real issue aside from the physical bone disease was ptsd episodes around the subject of substance abuse. I’m chronically (but not actively) suicidal, and whilst i no longer self-harm, i do smoke ~6 cigarettes a day, and also engage in compulsive hair pulling and skin picking.

Something I’ve found over the years is that my depression in particular is somewhat treatment resistant. I’ve previously taken Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Venlafaxine, and am now on Duloxetine (60mg). For the previous anti-depressants, I was on the highest dosages for all (except Sertraline which made me manic). 
My question is, could I double my duloxetine to 120mg without harming myself ? I also understand that medication is not a magic fix and i am still in therapy, only i’m really struggling with it, and as usual when winter comes, my mental health gets significantly worse.

Thanks in advance and thanks for the work you all do."

191,Question about stopping Wellbutrin XR,"My (25F) mother (47F) has been taking 100mg daily of Wellbutrin SR for depression, PTSD, & anxiety for a month & a half. My mom is 5’1, 190 lbs, Caucasian, & doesn’t drink or use rec drugs. She’s also been on 45mg of Remeron for a little over 2 years & it works great for her depression but she works 7 days a week as a housekeeper so she needs as much energy as possible. The Remeron is very sedating & has a couple other negative side effects that she was growing tired of. Hence why her doctor asked if she wanted to try Wellbutrin, which she was told helps with energy, weight loss, & smoking cessation. So far the Wellbutrin has made her feel increasingly panicked, anxious, and despaired. She’s crying all the time and said she feels crazy. She no longer wants to take Wellbutrin, she would rather just stick with the Remeron which she takes at night. Her doc wanted her to slowly taper off Remeron so she still takes a half dose (22.5mg). 

Her primary care doctor that prescribes these meds is not being helpful right now. My mom messaged her doc to ask if they can speak on the phone or come in for an appointment...she told the doc it’s urgent and expressed that she really needs to talk to a professional about what’s going on, however the doc just told her “we can talk about it at our appointment in 2 weeks”. 

My question is: can my mom just stop taking Wellbutrin SR (100mg/once a day) cold turkey or does she need to taper off of it?  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
192,"Strange vision-related side-effect of meds that my psychiatrist is dismissing as being due to something else entirely, but I'm convinced it is the meds. What is this symptom?","I'm M24. Weight, \~91kg. Height, \~181cm. Caucasian, from Europe.

This is very difficult to explain, so bare with me.

I notice this frequently in evenings. My vision starts to jump upwards, but not forcefully as in a case of oculogyric crisis, but sort of urging me to look upwards (I CAN control it.) If I'm using a computer, it doesn't jump upwards, but to the upper corners of what I'm looking at. It becomes extremely difficult and irritating to look at things during these attacks, as my vision doesn't want to stay on the objects I focus it on, so I usually end up closing my eyes and laying in my bed. During the attacks, my vision also likes to look at icons, symbols, flowers (on my walls) etc. The attacks start from 18:00 to 22:00, and they usually last for less than an hour or half an hour. The attacks became SEEMINGLY less frequent after starting piracetam. I've had these attacks for the past 2-3 months at a frequency of 1-3 per week. They seem to happen more frequently when I'm under heavy mental load, such as video games or generalized stress. The attacks did first start while playing video games intensely (Old School RuneScape, multi-tasking on 2 accounts.)

I'm diagnosed with **an other form of schizophrenia / F20.8** for more than 8 years, but have been medicated for only 5 years.

**When the attacks started**, I was taking 15mg aripiprazole, 12.5mgx3 tianeptine, and blood pressure meds (10mg betaxolol, 1mg rilmenidine).

**Currently, I'm taking** 10mg aripiprazole, 50mg sertraline, 800mgx2 piracetam, and blood pressure meds.

**I also take** 200mg l-theanine and B vitamins, which I started after the attacks.

I have been taking aripiprazole for close to a year. The shift to 10mg aripiprazole happened this month.

I have always had pretty severe mental health issues due to early childhood sexual abuse, rape, severe parental abuse. I went on to have abusive relationships and I have never really had friends because all the people I meet tend to be abusive in one way or another.

March 2018 I reconnected with a sibling that had just been released from prison for attempted murder. I guess I am an idiot for attempting that relationship, I should have known better but I just wanted to connect with someone.

She went on to kind of con me for money and things and was just . . . bad. It made me remember all the things that happened to me and all the abuse. I used to function fairly well but since that happened I don't. I went several months only leaving the house to pay my rent. I stopped seeing my PCP and taking all of my medications because he didn't seem to be listening to me, I felt blown off and it was just too much too take. I went off all meds cold turkey and let me tell you, that was rough.

A year later, here I am. I am in pretty bad shape mentally. I have tried a couple times to seek mental health care but it was pretty horrible. I can't bring myself to to try again, it just feels wrong and abusive and red flags galore. I really don't know what to do to get myself back on track.

197,"My anxiety is getting unbearable. Should I be adding a psychologist on top of my psychiatrist? Or add something to supplement my meds? Kinda long, sorry.","Meds: 300mg Wellbutrin daily for depression, Xanax as needed.  Remeron for sleep as needed but I don’t like/take it often.

I’m turning 30 in about a week. It’s a lot to explain, but I’ll sum it up that between having a crazy medical event that had me unable to eat or walk and having a catheter, having a seizure a few months ago, and getting a decent sized financial windfall in about a week that I’m freaking out about and paranoid about using the wrong way or spending it all, I’m having worse anxiety than I’ve ever had before. I’m using up my Xanax before my prescription is out (I have .5mg per day as needed but I told my psych I take two sometimes because .5 has never really cut it, but it has been every time this month), I can’t sleep because the Xanax hardly calms me down and the Remeron makes me so drowsy in the morning I feel like I’m going to fall asleep in the car line dropping my daughter off at school. It’s like there’s no happy medium. The anxiety has had physical effects as well such as hives in the past and there’s actually some suspicion it may have helped cause my seizure on day two of a new job. I think part of the anxiety is I’ve always had this windfall as a backup if something happens and I’m using part of it for home repairs and putting the rest into investment but it is making me feel like I don’t have a plan b or a safety net other than myself anymore and it’s freaking me out along with myself and my mom (who is my only living immediate family outside of my partner and hold) getting older. It just all seems SO scary and frightening that is debilitating at this point. 

I don’t want to just keep increasing my benzos. I know it’s dangerous to do so, my psychiatrist doesn’t seem willing to up them, but the anxiety is crippling me. It’s starting to get to the point where it’s impacting my entire life and career.  I tried therapy once but it didn’t seem to help, but should I be trying it again? 

If any psychs also have any suggestions about what I could take to supplement the Wellbutrin for anxiety that I could possibly ask my psych to try, even if off label, I would appreciate it. Buspar didn’t seem to do anything in the past but at this point I’m willing to try it again. If I’m even brave enough to ask him because my anxiety is so bad I get scared to admit how much I take my Xanax, I’m scared to ask for too many things or press when I kind of hint things aren’t working and he doesn’t change the meds, etc. I feel like I’m going to have a breakdown every time I go in to see my own psychiatrist (and I’ve contemplated switching because of this). He’s a nice guy, he’s just extremely cut and dry and I am lengthy and long winded like this post and it makes me feel like I’m a hassle."

203,Any good substitutes for low dose (25 mg) Seroquel?,"I am 37/M/6'2""/210 lbs.

I take lorazepam 3 mg (3 divided doses), paroxetine 20 mg, and Seroquel 25 mg (decreased from 50 mg over long period).

I was originally prescribed Seroquel for my Tourette's tics. I couldn't stay awake on it, so the doctor told me to take it at night.

This was back in 2003. Over many doctor retirements, it's been grandfathered in. No one even seems to ask why I take it. Does it help with my tics? Well, I tic less than I used to, but I feel like I would have ticced less anyway over time, but I'm not sure. I'm pretty isolated so ticcing is not really a concern right now.

Personally I think the Seroquel potentiates the lorazepam, and I found some research bearing that out, which may be why it's been difficult to titrate down. I had trouble getting from 50 to 25 mg. I never took it for sleep, but having to take it at night due to not being able to stay awake on it during the day it started regulating my sleep. And so I became one of those people who use it for sleep even though that was never the point.

I have type 2 diabetes, and I think it's in part from the Seroquel I had taken at 50 mg for so many years. Honestly the Seroquel does work. When I have worse spells of anxiety and flex up on the dose of Seroquel to 50 mg at night it does seem to help.

From my understanding at this dose it's primarily working as an anti-histamine but also still poses the metabolic risks.

I am wondering if there is an alternative. For example, I've never taken benadryl before, but does it have a similar effect with less side effects?

I'm also concerned about the anticholinergic burden of the Seroquel and Paxil combined.

I know the lorazepam is the elephant in the room. I started that decades ago when I was 14. I think tackling Seroquel to try to improve my metabolic state might be lower fruit I have a better chance of affecting."
204,I don’t know what’s wrong with me or if I should seek help.,"Ever since freshman year of highschool, it always seems as though my mental health has been on a steady decline and I don’t know what to do. 
I have always felt uncertain about my mental health, I was diagnosed with ADD when I was younger (around 10) but sometimes I feel like the H is in there somewhere. It’s getting harder and harder to stay focused in school or in drivers ed more. I fidget and shake my leg all the time nowadays, to where it pisses off my classmates. But I just can’t stop. 
I find it harder and harder to find the motivation to take care of myself, or carry out my duties as a student, daughter, or friend. 
My joy in many things have become so limited. 
I’ve started feeling... I don’t know what to call it... dismorphic I guess? There are days where I feel really beautiful. And there’s days where I feel like a hideous monster that should stay inside. It’s such a weird and unsettling feeling. As though I look foreign in people’s eyes even though I probably look fine. That feeling has slowly but surely increased as well with time. 
I started slowly binging and binging on food as I got older as well, and now I have a full blown problem with not consuming so much tiresome amounts of food. But I don’t call it binge eating disorder or anything because I am not formally diagnosed. 
I used to get anxiety attacks all the time, at least I think they were anxiety attacks. They were brief and spastic and would only happen a could times a day especially when traveling. I would work myself up like I was going to vomit, and my heart rate would beat at a mile a minute. I just had to cry or else it wouldn’t go away. Luckily those have subsided for the time being. 
There are some moments where I will feel amazing, full of hope, and positivity. But then the next minute I feel an overwhelming urge to end myself or hurt myself, always without fail deleting the posts of me being positive on social media because future me looks at past me and thinks I sound stupid. 
So yeah, I’m kind of stuck. Especially with the binging. It’s taken such a toll on me and my family, but everytime I try to quit it feels like there is an itch in my head (that’s the best way I can describe it) it makes me so irritable, angry, and unstable. 
I’ve been on Zoloft for awhile, but Prozac before, I just really even struggle with taking my medication these days as well. So if there’s any tips any of you health experts can give I would really appreciate it, truly. Please and thank you."
205,Are Wellbutrin and Vyvanse safe together?,Everything I’ve read has pointed to these two drugs increasing the risk of seizures when taken together. Is this a combination that a psychiatrist would ever prescribe or are the interactions too severe?
206,Bipolar,Can you be bipolar if you have numerous and frequent depressive episodes but rarely have manic episodes?
207,Can the ketogenic diet help with anxiety and unstable moods?,There’s been a few articles about this recently. Given that the actual ketogenic diet is used to significantly reduce seizures and since many mood stabilizers are also used as seizure medication it has been theorized it could also help with some mental illnesses. Any thought?
208,Does a mental disorder have to be *by definition* bad to be in the DSM?,"Edit: It’s not a rhetorical question. I just want to know why they did that. I couldn’t find more information information on this except APA’a working definition of mental disorder which didn’t help.

Edit 2: I mean a particular disorder to be defined as bad.

In ""Love-Variant: The Wakin-Vo I.D.R. Model of Limerence"" by Albert Wakin & Duyen B. Vo, the authors make a definition of 'limerence' and specifically make a point that ""limerence is an involuntary condition that is necessarily negative, problematic, and impairing."" This is likely so that it can be recognized as a mental disorder, especially in DSM.

I don't see why they have to redefine limerence to necessarily by bad. A child could be happy he caught a cold because he can miss school, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a disease. I am wondering if the authors changed the definition to fill a technical requirement in the DSM.

I ask because I am doing an English assignment on a potential DSM classification of limerence."
209,ADHD/GAD symptoms wax and wane? Treatment?,"I'm curious to know from a clinical and pharmacological side of things with patients who are dealing with ADHD and anxiety, is it normal for the symptoms of anxiety to be worse than ADHD for some days/weeks and vice versa for other days/weeks? 

If it is a common feature do you talk with your patients about the potential need for adjusting meds during these times for better treatment do you prefer to keep them on a very strict, stable daily schedule? I am wondering if this could be why my medicine seems to work ""better"" on some days but not others. I know factors like diet, sleep, and all play a role too. But, with the Psychiatrist, I'm just wondering if it might help to bring up the potential need for adjusting my doses during these changes on days with more anxiety or inattentivness or if it's just part of me learning to ""deal with it"" during fluctuations.

Edit: Just wanted to clear up that I am in a very stressful period right now and my anxiety is naturally going to be much higher. I understand this. I am NOT asking advice here to make any decisions about my own treatment. Just trying to get my thoughts in order for what I need to talk about when I meet my new Psychiatrist (old one moved away quite unexpectedly). Been having trouble with both the anxiety and inattentivness here now but on most days (when I don't have a stressful situation weighing in on me) the inattentivness is the more predominant of the two."
210,"My psychiatrist is on maternity leave, and I need to know if my Zoloft could be causing uti??","I can’t figure it out! Of course throughout the years I have had my fair share of UTI pain. I started on Zoloft a few months ago, and ever since I have started I have had a UTI pain once a month. Nothing else has changed except that! Put my mind at ease..."
211,Am I just anxious?,"I know this sounds strange, but hear me out. 

I'm a 20F from a multicultural background (white, black, and Native American). I'm 5'2"", 160ish lbs. I have anxiety, mostly social. I do have a history of depression and suicidal ideations that I would prefer not to discuss if possible. I am going to be getting neuropsychological testing done soon as well to test for Autism (tho I'm hoping to see if I can't get an answer for my impulsivity and inattentivenes). Right now, I'm on 75mg of Venlafaxine. Not sure if any of this matters, though. :) 

Basically, I sometimes get freaked out by the sheer magnitude of the human race, like how many people there are, and I feel like my individual life is both meaningless and inconsequential. Like, nothing I do will ever be important. If I fight with someone, I get anxious simply because it feels so meaningless. And, to be frank, I feel like all existence, to an extent, lacks meaning. It's really hard to explain, and that's as best as I can put it. It makes me a bit panicky, and when I panic like this, I tend to cry or temporarily shut down. I don't have as strong of a reaction unless I'm ""late"" taking my medication, it seems.

My question is: is this simply a symptom of anxiety/depression, and how ""normal"" is this? Have you heard of something like this before? If so, how is it classified?

Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for your time in advance."
212,Negative response to buproprion. Is atomoxetine likely to be tolerated?,"Hi,

A while ago I was prescribed buproprion to treat depression and as an adjunct for adhd-i. The first week was pretty good but then rapidly nosedived. I became very very depressed out of the blue and ended up having a panic attack. This all cleared up a week or two after ceasing buproprion. 

Im interested in complementing my usual vyvanse dose with another adhd med. I've read good things about the combination of a stimulant with atomoxetine addressing a broader range of symptoms than a stimulant alone. 

I'd like to try this combination but am worried I will have a similar reaction to it as I did with buproprion. Do you have any experience with patients responding poorly to buproprion and who have gone on to try atomoxetine?

I've got a review scheduled with my psych soon and will discuss possible medication changes with them. In the meantime any information you could supply to satisfy my curiousity would be appreciated. 

Cheers."
213,Are there increased risks associated with high-intensity exercise done while on prescription stimulants?,"Stimulants like Adderall and Vyvanse are known to be taxing on the cardiovascular system.

Does high-intensity exercise while on a stimulant pose any particular risks that a patient should be aware of? Or are the risks present regardless of activity level and inherent to stimulant use as a whole?"
214,Can you explain acid reflux (GERD) that occurs when my mood fluctuates from ultra rapidly cycling bipolar?,"I had this mysterious acid reflux (GERD) that is not connected with what food I eat or when I eat food (I can chug a bottle of hot sauce and no acid reflux). My mood changes rapidly from my bipolar (sometimes I can feel it change from hour-to-hour or even feel new symptoms every 15 minutes) and I think that the mood changes are connected with the acid reflux. I think the acid reflux happens like 5 minutes before an ""up"" in my mood, but I'm not 100% sure. Can you explain this link between mood and acid reflux?

&#x200B;

Description of my condition: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dbyfr9/25m\_rapidly\_cyclical\_depression\_after\_rapidly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dbyfr9/25m_rapidly_cyclical_depression_after_rapidly/)

p.s. If you can recommend what you think would be the ideal antidepressant for the depressive symptoms that I described in that post I would appreciate it - I would propose your suggestion to my new psychiatrist.

&#x200B;

Mandatory extra information: age 25, male sex, 5'11"", 190lb, Middle Eastern descent, have been having this for over two years, past diagnosis of bipolar, schizoaffective, and childhood ADHD, currently taking 2.5mg Olanzapine and 25mg lamictal, no recreational drugs.

&#x200B;

Update 1: My new doctor just wrote a prescription to add Latuda for bipolar depression.

Update 2: It's a sudden gently burning feeling in my lower throat (neck area). Like I could just be walking down the street without having eaten any food in six hours and I suddenly have this acid reflux and need to take a Pepsid and also I have these weird mood fluctuations that aren't connected with any real world events. If I don't take Famitidine (Pepsid) I get chronic inflammation in my esophagus (GERD / Barrett's esophagus). I don't believe the acid reflux is a coincidence - it's been happening for six years. It's happened regardless of the drug (Lithium, Depakote, Olanzapine, etc). Again, unlike normal acid reflux it doesn't matter what food I eat or when I eat food. I have these mental fluctuations that don't feel normal (like fluctuating psychotic symptoms or depressive symptoms) and this acid reflux that isn't connected to food or medication. I can't think of any other cause - normal acid reflux measures like tilting my bed at an angle or not eating spicy foods made no difference."
215,Is it ethical to suggest divorce to a new patient during their first visit?,"My husband is extremely depressed and suicidal. I searched for a good psychiatrist and found one who was listed as one of the three best in our area. My husband went to his first appointment, and was given a diagnosis of severe depression and possibly bipolar 2 disorder. The psychiatrist also suggested that he leave me. Not in so many words but that was the impression my husband got and relayed to me after his appointment.


I want to know if this is ethical behavior. It seems to me that you don't suggest making major changes in a patient's life, in their first visit and when you suspect bipolar disorder."

217,"Based on your experiences with patients, which psychiatric treatment/drug produces the most satisfying/positive result?","I'm taking a toxicology class and the professor mentioned today that treatments for psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or depression tend to have a very low success rate ( at least when compared to treatments of non-psychological issues like high blood pressure) due to the high variability in neurotransmitter receptor subtypes in the brain. The example he gave was the fact that the use of Clozapine in treatment of schizophrenia fails for patients who have the misfortune not to express the 5HT2A serotonin receptor. 

All of this made me wonder if psychiatric professionals had positive/optimistic experiences with any particular treatments that really help your patients. I've heard that lithium can be that way for people suffering bipolar disorder but I may be totally wrong and am willing to be corrected."
218,"I'm diagnosed with F20.8 (based on ICD-10), which is ""an other form of schizophrenia."" How can I be confident my diagnosis is correct? What do you think of my story?","There are a lot of details to include.

I'm male. 24 years old currently. My weight is \~91kg, and height is 183cm. Caucasian, from Europe. I'm diagnosed with an other form of schizophrenia. I also have high blood pressure and heart palpitations, which are exacerbated by stress.

Current medication: 

* Sertraline 50mg (not working)
* Aripiprazole 10mg (down from 15mg for more than a week with no new symptoms)
* Tianeptine 1x12.5mg (withdrawing from)
* Piracetam 2x800mg (helps my vision symptoms, but has no noticeable effect on cognition or mood)
* Rilmenidine 1mg (blood pressure)
* Betaxolol 10mg (heart rhythm)
* L-theanine 200mg and B-complex. Self-added. Funnily enough, I'm not sure they do anything.

8 years ago, when I was 16, I started to notice that I progressively got more fatigued every day until the fatigue came on instantly in the next 1-2 days after mental exertion and wouldn't leave easily. I then one day suddenly developed severe depression and anxiety, and I behaved like I was crazy due to these sudden, terrible feelings. I was angry at my girlfriend. I was irritable with my mom, especially. Eventually, I broke up with my now-ex, but I obsessively kept thinking of her and looking at her socials. This lasted for 3 years, unmedicated, and slowly got better until a point.

On the third year, I suddenly developed shoulder pains and, at about the same time, strong fear of having heart problems after I fainted. Sertindole 1mg fixed my shoulder pains. Some time after fainting, there was an event where I got scared, jumped up, and my heart made a huge ""BOOM"", after which it would beat erratically, and it was difficult breathing. My heart problems were mostly dismissed and never checked by my GP, outside of the usual ECG, which I got ""unlucky"" on. But this year, the Holter monitor confirmed that I have heart palpitations, and I'm not crazy for feeling them, although it is probably unusual.

I want to point out that video games have made a huge difference in how I feel in the short-term. There was a time when I played OldSchool RuneScape for 3 weeks straight, and I felt ecstatic due to the nostalgia. Then cold-turkeyed off of it, because I felt very good mentally. But after that I started feeling bad again.

Not all video games have been this great for me, however. When I played Town of Salem, which is a social manipulation kind of game, I got so stressed that I couldn't fall asleep, I had weird ""noise"" in my vision, looking at darkness during that period of overstimulation made me feel a burning sensation, eventually I panicked out of it after I thought I was having a heart attack due to the obviously high blood pressure I was having (160+/something, as measured by the ambulance I called). The ambulance came, I went downstairs with them and got on the stretcher. During the ride to the hospital, my legs were sort of pulling up to my chest very slightly. Maybe this is a sign of catatonia? After arriving at the psych unit, they gave me a diazepam shot, and my heart very quickly went haywire with long pauses and strong, sometimes random, beats, but I fell asleep and woke up multiple times.

Later, a psych doc was trying to put me on 16mg sertindole, but I didn't like none of it, so I tapered down to 4mg and was fine for a very long time until I tried to withdraw down to 3.5mg by taking my pills inconsistently, which was extremely stupid of me. Basically, I took 3mg, then 4mg, then 3mg again, for a week or two. After that, one of my thoughts caused a shock-like feeling, and I became extremely dizzy. Was quickly hospitalized again, and put on ziprasidone (caused severe akathisia), bromazepam, and sertraline.

Sertraline very quickly fixed my depressive symptoms temporarily, but then pooped out on me after I withdrew from it. I withdrew from sertraline, because I believed it was possible that it was causing some of the dizziness, which I was actually experiencing from the bromazepam withdrawal, and probably, the attempted sertindole withdrawal.

When I first took sertraline, I reacted immediately to it. I started noticing pleasant feelings in my hands at first. Then my sleep shortened down to 7 hours (it's \~11 hours now). I became extremely social and motivated. Upon withdrawal from sertraline, I felt like I was having some sort of enlightening, hyper-pleasant experience, but I didn't think much of it.

My eyes sometimes can't find a spot to ""land on"" in the evenings, and with every jump they keep going higher and higher, nearly uncontrollably. I think this is a side-effect of aripiprazole.

Sorry about the long story, and I imagine I probably forgot to add something, so if you're interested, you can ask me questions about anything.

219,Medical abandonment.,"My Psych doc moved away 2 months ago without notifying any of the patients. This happened during the middle of a crisis point in my own life with me going through what has to be the hardest year of my life. I just turned 32 and am in the middle of so many diagnostic tests, new diagnoses and different meds prescribed by different doctors (like methotrexate, Enbrel, etc) on top of all the financial stressors and underlying Psych disorders like GAD, panic, insomnia, ADHD inattentive type, depression due to a medical condition-- ALL of which she had been treating for the better part of FIVE YEARS! Yes, I have been her patient over 5 years and she just left me hanging out to dry after we had developed what I thought to be an exceptional relationship with both of us on board with what the other person was expecting out of her treatment goals and my patient needs. 

Since she did not show up for my last appt, stopped answering or returning calls on both the office and emergency phone lines, and I found out she'd left her practice and moved, I have been going through every negative emotion in the book-- fear, frustration, confusion, denial, sadness, disbelief, anger... As soon as I realized what happened, I immediately called my PCP to take over medication management til I could find a new Psychiatrist to establish care with and take over treatment. PCP gave me enough medication for 3 months which I think is completely fair. 

Therein lies the problem. I live in a relative smaller Southeastern US city where doctors get crap wages with Psychiatrists having been hit the hardest. From what I understand, all but one facility/office here became cash  only as our insurance in this state stopped reimbursing privately practicing psychiatrists (I could be wrong on this or things may have changed since I last checked on it). Point being that many of our psych docs aren't even making enough to stay in business for themselves and every single hospital but one has repurposed their psych floors for something else that hospitals can afford as well. I suspect this may have something to do with why my doctor moved. Regardless, she did not notify me or call me or message me or hint IN ANY SINGLE WAY THAT SHE WAS LEAVING. 

I had done some research looking into the few doctors left in my area practicing Psychiatry at patient reviews, education, etc and made an appt with a doctor who I expected to be an excellent, open minded practitioner earlier this afternoon. I'd waited 6 weeks to see her and the appt did not go well at all. She is an older doctor who looks like she's getting ready to retire. She did not have me fill out any paperwork except for one sheet with my name and address and phone number. Nothing about medication forms or HIPPA or medical conditions or symptoms or assessment or anything. It seemed to me like she was very old school and said that my physical health problems were being caused by my mental health when my last doctor that moved said the exact opposite and that I had been experiencing a new depression due to an underlying medical condition. I asked this new doctor about payment on the phone well in advance of the appt and she said I'd pay when I came in to fill out my paperwork. When I went in earlier she said that I'd pay at the end of my appt. At the end of my appt she did not collect any payment or do any assessments and I'm being shuffled out of the room without any kind of idea what her thoughts or plans or goals are with me as she told me it was time for her next patient. She did not address a single one of my medication management needs. 

So here I am now one week away from having my last month of refills before I run out of medication and I'm still stressed to no end. I'm literally in tears right now. I've lost literally everything I spent my entire adult life working towards in undergrad/graduate school with my career path. I know this is a long story but from a patient's perspective I am terrified I am not going to be able to find a competent doctor or anyone who can take over medication management before I run out let alone one that I would actually feel confident in trusting in a doctor/patient relationship. The wait list for them all is minimum 3 weeks with many being month long and others not even accepting any new patients. So, to all of the psychiatrists and patients still reading this... Now what?"
220,Amwell Psychiatry,"Hi all -- posted this in the wrong sub earlier, so reposting here

I have an appointment on Amwell for a telepsychiatry session.

I cannot find this anywhere -- does anyone know if they prescribe SSRI's and off-lable beta blockers? I know it says no controlled substances, etc. so that means no Xanax -- which i don't want.

I'm a consultant and always on the road - so this service is exceptionally helpful. But, I still don't want to pay $200 not knowing if they actually fill those prescriptions.

Anyone have experience?"

222,Are there any ADD/ADHD meds that can be successful when taken with Lexapro?,"[M, 19] So I have anxiety and depression and possibly ADHD. I talked to the psychiatrist at my university about the possibility of taking a stimulant and he was basically like “no way”. He said that in 25 years of working, he has seen one case of someone with both anxiety and ADHD. He said “let’s wait until your lexapro really kicks in, and then we can talk more about ADHD.” I totally respect this plan of his. It is absolutely possibly that my “ADHD symptoms” are really just anxiety symptoms. But... if my lexapro kicks in, and it turns out that I do have ADHD... is there any medication that can help me without driving my anxiety insane?? Will lexapro continue to work just as well if taken with a stimulant? He made it sound like I basically have to choose weather to treat my anxiety or my ADHD with meds... which sucks."
223,"I have a few questions about our current understanding of the side effects of anti-depressants and, more generally, about what progress there has been over the last few years in this area","Hello!

If you read the literature accompanying pretty much any medication for depression or anxiety, you'll find an enormous list of possible side effects, each graded according to how common/likely they are to be experienced. The most common side effects seem to be quite uniform across all such medications. For example: dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, vivid nightmares, drowsiness, etc. Why is this the case? And do we understand what is actually happening in the brain/body when each of those side effects manifests? Like, take dizziness, can we say something along the lines of ""such-and-such SSRI targets such-and-such part of the brain which also handles our sense of balance""?

My other question is a general one, prompted by reading that the pharmacology of anti-depressant medication hasn't been updated or innovated upon since the 80s. If that's true, do we know why? And what is currently being done in this area? I've heard about psychedelics showing promise for depression, but it seems that this is reserved only for special cases where everything else fails to work. So, for those of us still in the ""failing"" phase, what new things are on the horizon for mass use?

Thank you for your time!"
224,What other options for medication (mainly anti depressants) are there other than a daily pill?,"I HATE taking a daily pill. I'm not 100% sure what it is, but I cannot stand it, and I always end up stopping meds. Is there any alternative ways to take medication? I've heard there is a weekly prozac pills, which I've considered but never tried. Are there any other weekly pills like that, or IM injections or something?"
225,"Is conscience innate, or is it the product of religion, education and/or upbringing?",
226,Is this normal behaviour?,"I (F26) was referred to a psychiatrist for ADHD testing a few months ago. Upon meeting me he ruled out ADHD and began the session. He asked my symptoms and family history etc. The session lasted about 30 minutes.

The following session was 2 weeks later and was supposed to last an hour to investigate in more detail. He was 30 mins late, announced on arrival that he was giving me a diagnosis of ASD but gave me no documentation, only told me to contact a local support group. He also said he would leave a letter stating the diagnosis in reception during the week so I could set up supports for college. The session barely lasted 15 minutes.

The letter never appeared and I spent the last 2 months calling into the health centre and ringing them but I never got any information re my diagnosis. My family also had never been interviewed for information about my childhood. The ASD support group were brilliant and helped me contact the psychiatrist directly for information. I spent the last 2 months very low and confused as I didn't understand my diagnosis (didn't really feel it fit properly) and had no diagnostic report or criteria for information or proof. I couldn't access any supports in college without evidence.

I had a session the other day  My dad attended with me for support. I demanded to know where my documentation was and the psychiatrist lost it at me. He couldn't understand why I was so upset, said it was no big deal and that I had lived for 26 years without the information that 2 months wasn't any reason to be upset. He threatened me saying that if he didn't let the college know of my situation, no one would and I would be left to suffer alone. When ai asked why he gave me the ASD diagnosis and for information on how my symptoms played into it, he said he wasn't actually sure if ASD was accurate and decided I may have ADD. 

He will see me again in another month and wants to prescribe me stimulants to test his ADD hypothesis. I'm not entirely comfortable with his process and not sure how much I can trust him. My dad says this behaviour is probably all part of his diagnostic process and I need to trust him as he has 40 years medical experience. I just want to know is this typical or do I have reason to mistrust him? I'm the first person in my family to ever see a mental health professional so we have no frame of reference."
227,Can you Overcome Psychosis?,"Hi, I'm taking Aripiprazole and Duloxetine, i have depression with psychotic features, i'm wondering do I need to take the meds forever or can I heal from psychosis and depression?"
228,Are there any good substitutes for SSRI medications that are effective with treating symptoms of depression?,"Okay, where do I begin...
I’m 20f, and have been through a very traumatic process when it comes to finding a medication to treat my clinical depression and panic disorder. 
I’ve tried multiple different SSRI’s and had ended up hospitalized several times for very adverse reactions.
The first time this occurred was when I was 16 and seeing a nurse practitioner 3 times a week  at an IOP, 
At this time, I was In a pretty bad depressive episode that was hindering my ability to function normally,  it became apparent to me for the first time that I was experiencing symptoms of depression.
I was put on Prozac, 20mgs I believe (maybe less, my memory is a bit foggy in regards to this). 
After a day or so , or later that same day I’m not sure when ...I began to have tremors in my hands, face, almost everywhere, even my  toes. I also experienced weird muscle twitches and spasms under my skin, almost like a crawling sensation, profuse sweating, my pupils were extremely dilated and I was having multiple panic attacks per day.

I went to the hospital, and was hysterical and panicking so they transferred me from the ER to crisis unit to have a doctor consult and evaluate  me. 
They decided to transfer me to one of the only pediatric psych units in my county, it was a few towns over. I waited for three days to be transferred via ambulance , and was administered the meds every day (along with Ativan). When I got there the psychiatrist didn’t think anything of it and chalked it up to it being symptoms of gad/panic disorder, 
Although these symptoms and the perpetual loop of panic attacks were not characteristic of me. They abruptly stopped my meds and after a week or so had me sign a waver to be committed voluntarily for an indefinite duration. After a week and a half  of crying spells they placed me into Zoloft the day i was scheduled to be released. 
This time with Zoloft the aforementioned symptoms became so much worse, my pupils took up the entirety of my iris, and where sluggish, I was sweating much more than before, and the tremors turned into muscle spasms..I was shaking everywhere, my neck, face, from my head to me toe and under my skin, I  also felt zapping sensations in my head. Long story short , I went back to the hospital and they didn’t think that it was due to some intolerance to the medication, it was a different psychiatrist this time so it could be attributed to that.

This was when I was initially  prescribed benzodiazepines, kolonopin to be exact and cojentin to ease my nerves (the cojentin didn’t help the tremors and shakes or anything else). 
I was soon taken off of zoloft within a week after being admitted again and put on an antipsychotic, seroquel. I  was also  referred to a neurologist. 
I had gotten an EEG and an MRI just to be sure it wasn’t a neurological issue, there was nothing abnormal that came up and I was told that I was simply intolerant to SSRI’s. 

I’m now no longer on seroquel or kolonopin(and later detoxed off of Xanax after I switched from kpin).
The antipsychotic medication didn’t really relieve my symptoms of depression and since then , over the past few years it’s only gotten 1000x worse and I am at the point where I don’t leave my house for months or practice any kind of self care/get dressed etc.

Are there any meds of a different class that are as effective as SSRI’s are for some people?
I want to give medication another try but am terrified of getting my hopes up again and am at the end of ropes."

As I understand it, although some legalities around involuntary detention differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, generally speaking, for someone to be involuntary committed they have to first be examined and certified by two physicians who believe the requirements have been met. I believe that’s the general rule of thumb in most common common law or democratic counties. If that’s generally the case, why are psychiatrists allowed to simply copy the information from one certificate to another instead of performing a secondary examination ? If the whole point of a secondary certificate is to ensure checks &amp; and balances, why isn’t there separate examinations performed with every subsequent certifications to prevent mistakes or abuse of process from occurring? 
If mistakes occur with the initial examination and incorrect/inaccurate information causes a misdiagnosis on the initial certificate, than any other certificate performed from a separate Doctor would be incorrect or inaccurate also."
232,Will my OCD symptoms come back if I stop lexapro?,"Lexapro truly saved my life, I have OCD and I was a neurotic angry anxious wreck before lexapro. Mentally I'm doing well on it.

Been having liver issues and it's made me gain 30 stubborn lbs. 

Is it worth coming off of? Obviously I'll taper off with doctors supervision. Will all my symptoms come back? I'm horrified of that ever happening again."
233,Who is qualified to diagnose autism?,"A debate has come up among me and some friends. Who is qualified to make an official, medical autism diagnosis?

Ideally it should be a psychologist or psychiatrist who specializes in Autism correct?

But if not that, can any clinical psychologist or psychiatrist diagnose a person? And what is the protocol?

Personally I was diagnosed (and then studied) by a team at a “renowned” autism research center (part of a famous hospital.) It was extremely comprehensive and it was also free."
234,Can Psychiatrists keep a involuntary patient in hospital even if they believe they are stabilized?,"This is not pertaining to a particular situation, it’s just a general question about the practice of psychiatry. I’ve heard that Psychiatrists can keep a involuntary patient in hospital for a little longer after they’ve been deemed to be stabilized, just to test them a bit more to ensure they are stabilized? Is this true? I thought the patient has to be discharged if they are stable?"
