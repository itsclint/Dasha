0,Second line treatment options for SCLC?,"
Seeking advice from clinicians regarding second line treatment for refractory limited stage SCLC.
Radiation oncologist doesn’t want to go ahead with PCI after looking at last scan.  Next appt with oncologist we’d like to discuss what options are available, including immunotherapy.  Thank you for all you do and peace be with you."
1,I NEED ADVICE,"The patient is to begin chemotherapy today, the combination treatment of bleomycin and 
myelosuppresive drug.

Severe allergic reactions can occur with these drug combinations, which include hypotension 
and pulmonary toxicity (e.g. interstitial 
pneumotitis and pulmonary fibrosis). 

Discuss how you plan to explain these 
reactions to the patient and reassure that 
the adverse reactions will be identified and 
managed. 

Decide how much information to 
give and explain your reasoning."
2,"[Hypothetical question] Is it possible to inject a syrum of T-cells that have experience fighting cancer, into someone currently diagnosed with cancer? Would this hypothetically be possible, and what effect would it cause?","Hello, university biology student here just learning about adaptive immunity in the body. Wondering would it be possible to either:

 A. Took cytotoxic T cells from a patient that beat cancer (not sure if possible to extract just T-cells) 

 or

 B. Lab-bred special T-cells that you've allowed to come into constant contact with cancer cells and fight it

Would the injection of this hypothetical syrum have any possible beneficial effects on someone with cancer? Or would the T-cells run rampant and start destroying all of said individuals tissue due to it being ""foreign"" 

Has this ever been studied or attempted?"
3,Looking for advice from oncologists!,"Hey guys!

I'm an engineering student at the University of British Columbia working with other engineering & business students to create a more affordable way to create custom wigs. We're currently trying to figure out if this idea has any merit and if people would appreciate it. We wanted to get some input from oncologists since we know many chemotherapy patients get wigs, but we know that doing non-medical research on medical patients isn't ethical. Hoping you guys can help us out.  


1) How disheartening is it for them to lose hair? Are most patients just concerned about staying healthy or do many patients feel very worried about hair loss?

2) Do patients typically have access to a custom-fitted wig as part of their insurance or do they usually have to pay out of pocket? If they pay out of pocket how many patients are unable to afford a custom wig?

3) And when they start considering which type of wig to get how do they make the decision? Do you typically refer them to wig shops or to do online self-research?

If there's anything else you think would be useful for us to know before we embark on this journey I'd love to know more and would definitely appreciate a DM or even a phone call so I can get some more insight.  


Thanks,

Aidan"
4,Cancer from walking on street with people smoking around me ?,"Hi, 
This might be odd but what are my chances of getting cancer from the smokers around me during my daily commute to work. Its second hand smoke and I get whiffs of it when I go to work. It bothers me but its not as bad a sitting in a room with smokers. 
How does this increase my odds of cancer?

Secondly, if I were recovering from influenza(a respiratory infection) and came across second hand smoke...would that increase the risk of cancer? 

deeply appreciate if someone with clinical experience would shed some light on this. 

thank you so much!"
5,Mucus in peritoneum... possible conditions?,"Biopsy indicates: 
Smears demonstrate groups of epitheliod cells with inconspicuous nucleoli in a background of mucin.

Biopsy taken from the omentum. 

Are there any possible conditions this could be besides mucinous adenocarcinoma or does the presence of mucin and/or the immunohistological stains definitively rule out other conditions such as granulomatous infections, peritoneal sarcoidosis, lupus peritonitis, or any others?

My mom is currently on etoposide/carboplatin and is responding well to treatment. I’ve been reading a few case studies about long term survivors of SCLC, and found that a few of these were taking somatostatin analogs. 

Could any of you give me any more information about this? I am wondering how one should go about finding out whether my mom could respond well to this, are there any tests etc? Also, if I ask one of her doctors about this, would they be familiar with this type of treatment? 

Just looking to be more informed before potentially discussing this with her doctors.

Thanks a lot for the help!"

25,Startup Research Center. Question for Oncologist,"My name is David and I am the founder of a startup that researches rare diseases.  The first disease that I am addressing is a blood cancer with four types and the generic disease name is Leukemia.  My background in the medical field is in healthcare operations for both clinical and administration since 2011 and have a MHA degree, so I will address the business side of the startup.  This means my Co-Founder will need to have research background.

&#x200B;

My question is directed towards oncologist/hematologist; what would you be looking for in a startup research center to want to be a Co-Founder?

&#x200B;

My idea is to use genome mapping on the four types of diseases in Leukemia to locate the weakness using two proven managing strategies called root-cause analysis & DMAIC to help manage the research process to prevent full resets of the research process.  The form of the cure will be up to the researchers to decided this portion."
26,Precision medicine overhyped?,"Surgical oncology researcher here.

I’ve been watching the precision medicine movement evolve over the years and I’m a little skeptical.

From a biological internal validity point of view, the idea of creating a precise molecular signature for a cancer mass that is a) genetically heterogenous (results depend on sampling) and b) evolving in a Darwinian fashion, doesn’t make inherent sense to me.

This seems to play out in the therapeutic results: limited successes in small patient subgroups, which are not sustained over time.

What am I missing? How will these limitations be overcome in the future?

Is this all hype?"
27,Cleveland clinic oncologist doesn’t know what is causing my dads Pancytopenia,"My dads physician diagnosed him with Pancytopenia and referred him to a hematologist.

28,Stage 4 small cell lung cancer and coughing question,My mom has stage 4 non small cell lung cancer. She coughs very often. She’s presently on abraxane. There are no new lesions in her lung. Any thoughts on why she’s coughing so much?
29,Mom is stopping hormone medication after severe side effect. Advice?,"My mom had stage IIB IDC, ER+, and started taking tamoxifen after completing radiation and double mastectomy. The tamoxifen sent her into immune thrombocytopenia purpura (rare complication, but common enough to be documented) that dropped her platelet count to zero. Treatment for that has been horrid (IVIG reaction), and she was taken off the tamoxifen for fear of another crash. 

Now, they want to put her into menopause and start an aromatase inhibitor. She's decided she doesn't want any of it. And I understand, I do. The complications she's been through have been severe.

I guess I'm just curious if anyone else stopped taking their meds and how they felt? Or anyone who stopped and went back on? Really, just finding any information that isn't a blogger suggesting rocks cure cancer or doctors saying ""you need the meds and there's no alternative"" would be great."
30,Hypothetical,"My mom passed away from non-small cell lung cancer in 2016 at 66 after 2.5 months from symptom onset. She was never a smoker/never lived with a smoker. 

It had spread to her bones(spine, hip, rib) and a spot on her liver.

My question is hypothetical, even if she beat the odds and went into full remission and was completely cleared what would her quality of life been like? She had to wear a back brace and neck brace. The cancer obliterated her C4 vert and she had surgery on that before she passed, as well as her left hip bone which her also had surgery on.

I just keep telling myself that she wouldn't be able to do much, her bones would be too damaged to travel like she wanted to. I think her quality of life would have been poor even if she survived."
31,looking for an opinion on using antiangiogenic regimen in ATRT,"My 19 month old son was diagnosed with ATRT at 1 month old. Completed the Dana Farber Protocol (IRS-III) with 2 tandem stem cell rescues. No radiation therapy was done due to his age. Was found to have relapsed 3 months post treatment. Attempted a clinical trial with tazometostat which was unsuccessful, tumors doubled in size during that time. Was initially placed on dexamethasone and avastin for palliative treatment after stopping the trial. He has since improved and recent MRI showed a 3% reduction in tumor size. He will have another dose of avastin in a few days to be continued every two weeks. Our oncologist has been toying with the idea of using an antiangiogenic regimen due to the response he had with the avastin and steroids. Looking for any first hand knowledge of this used for ATRT. We have only found one case study out of France so far. He has three tumors, the largest is in the right frontal with significant midline shift, second largest is more central and the smaller tumor is in the posterior fossa fourth ventrical. We are running out of options at this point and hoping to find more knowledge to make our decision."
32,Cat & Chemo,"Question about chlorambucil 1.4mg. I give it to my cat, every other day. I know I am to wear gloves when scooping the box, if I have to bathe fecal matter off her or wash her dishes. I am wondering if I need to be concerned with sharing a bed (blankets/sheets) with her after she licks herself clean? Since there is the medication in her salvia, which would be deposited on her fur, then she would be laying on soft surfaces. Should I be concerned and avoid this behavior? Or is it such trace amounts that I shouldn’t worry? 

Thank you"

35,"Terminal Testicular Cancer, looking for a second opinion or ideas","Hello,

I had testiculer cancer for a few years now (Seminoma). I went through the initial 4 cycles of chemo, then went through another 4 cycles of salvage. After that I did the RPLND surgery because the cancer was confined to a few lymph nodes in the abdomen according to the pet scan. Well six months went by till my next cat scan, and it has returned in more lymph nodes in the abdomen. So now they wanted to pursue a stem cell transplant, but before that they needed to put a nephrostomy tube in to protect one of my kidneys because a lymph node was pushing up against the ureter/kidney. Besides putting in the nephrostomy tube, they wanted me to get started on chemo right away, so I did that. This particular time when I did chemo(cisplatin), it hurt my kidney, so I guess I have acute kidney injury, I am not sure if the kidneys will return to normal or not, but the stem cell oncologist won't do anything until the creatinine gets back down where it needs to be. So my only option left is to do Radiation therapy, which isn't a cure and even if they do shrink the tumors and maybe the Kidney function improves over time. I still will have to do high dose chemo and that will just destroy the kidneys before I do a stem cell transplant. Is there away around this? Does anybody have a different opinion advice, or this is it for me. I think even my doctors are thinking this is way too optimistic. The stem cell oncologist said he would do it, via his nurse."

I'm taking a 2-3 hour nap every day, and that is very unusual for me. My wrists are painful and I can't open anything because of the wrist pain. My back is so painful that it makes toileting a challenge. Can I just stop taking it? Would it be dangerous?"

I received a referral for a patient for voice therapy from an ENT and the working diagnosis is muscle tension dysphonia. After seeing this patient a couple times, I'm worried that it isn't just MTD, but rather late effects of radiation. He had surgery and radiation therapy to his tonsil area. His neck on that side is extremely firm, with a significant reduction in mobility. It's about 13 years post treatment and in the last four months his voice has become very hoarse and he is having trouble swallowing. We'll have him in for a modified barium swallow to see about his swallowing, but I'm wondering if usual treatments for muscle tension dysphonia (laryngeal massage, stretches, etc) may actually be harmful or just not effective and a waste of his time if it's due to the fibrotic tissue rather than muscle tension. I'm also wondering if it's possible that damage to the tissue may lead to neuromuscular issues. I hope to approach his physicians about this but I'd like to have some decent understanding and some good questions before I meet with them. Thanks in advance."

At these symposiums I constantly hear how researchers are forced to use spreadsheets – copying and pasting data, resulting in transcription errors, difficult collaboration and wasted time trying to crowbar their workflows into an archaic solution.

&#x200B;

That's why we built [Overwatch Research](https://www.overwatchresearch.com/), a platform accessible from any device with a web browser. Features include:

&#x200B;

* Comprehensive study design including treatment groups and unique identifiers
* Team permissions
* Instant hands free transcription of data using bluetooth hardware
* Randomisation based on any factor such as sex, weight, tumour volume etc.
* Automatic generation of graphs and survival curves
* Support for treatment groups
* Instant export of all data
* Sample collection and archival
* Task management and team calendar

Complex Mucinous Type Glands

Comments: This finding may be associated with endometrial hyperplasia or neoplastic process. Clinical follow up or rebiopsy is recommended if clinically indicated.

Previous pap smear: negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. 

The dr was confused by this report even called the lab to discuss it and is still confused because she says she hasn’t seen reports like this before. She has referred her to an oncologist. Can someone please explain what this means? 

My very amateur understanding is they found a mass/ cell growth that can be either a) hyperplasia or b) neoplastic. Both cell growths can be benign or malignant but they didn’t indicate it, so should we assume it means the lab thought they were benign but have a future risk? Or was the lab unable to determine if they are cancerous?

Either way she will be going to an oncologist and we expect that most likely surgery will be needed as a precaution but my question is: are the cells already cancerous OR do they just pose a risk to become cancerous OR was the lab unable to determine in this biopsy. 

Not sure if this is the right sub to post this in but thought maybe someone here can help. Thanks. "

53,Question about Vinblastine & dose reductions,"My son (2.75yrs) has two Optic Pathway Gliomas (NF1 positive)... he started taking weekly Vinblastine at 6mg/m^2 but developed neutropenia 4 weeks in.  Our oncologist said that this is because his body is ""extra sensitive"" to Vinblastine but said it's likely that at this dose both the toxic and therapeutic effects will be elevated, and that at a lower dose both will be normal.

I was trying to find a general source that talks about correlation between side effects, dose reductions, and therapeutic effectiveness but have been unable to find anything.  In other NF1 specific research I've found that dose reductions of MEK inhibitors due to excessive toxicity is associated with less therapeutic benefit, so I'm skeptical.

59,Statin Use is Associated with Decreased Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence in Liver Transplant Patients,
60,Totally stumped rare skin cancer shortly followed by a totally different cancer which killed in weeks. What scenarios would cause this?,"My father (77 non smoker non drinker: athletically fit however a history of high bp ) diagnosed with rare skin cancer Merkel cell carcinoma on upper chest (level 5) he had in the past had 12x melanomas all removed surgically with 3-6 monthly follow up. 

This skin cancer was removed in totality and preventative (skin flap) surgery was undertaken (ct scans showed no activity or spread to lymph nodes) with 5 weeks of radiation therapy.  

4 weeks into radiation dad developed a cough (we thought a side effect of radiation due to the location of the therapy) he developed severe burns week 4 but skin recovered. 

After radiation was over he went away for a week and a very very fast and large developing mass grew on his Inguinal lymph nodes. He had a core biopsy (multiple samples taken) and we were told it was “cancerous”
But absolutely not melanoma and not Merkel cell. The oncologist was perplexed as it was “inconclusive”.

He had a PET scan which showed the mass and a few small spots in the lungs which we were told would have to be treated with “drugs” (chemo)

Since the biopsy wasn’t “good enough” (so said the oncologist) but the pathologist who took the sample disagreed as dad spoke to him and the pathologist said the sample was fine.. they did another one and also now a lung biopsy. 

Dad went home and within a week he was sweating, sleeping all the time, losing balance , falling over. He fell over in the bathroom, Mum couldn’t get him up and called an ambulance. 
The paramedics said he had a fever as his heart was racing etc. 

He was taken to hospital and hallucinating constantly (animals on the walls) he did have a brain scan and this was clear. 

During his hospital his dr was lining up immunotherapy for Merkel cell as he was sure that this spread was from the original cancer diagnosed. Pathology would not approve this as the pathology reports from the biopsy revealed a LARGE cell cancer which did not resemble Merkel. ( I have no idea what these look like) 

He had lung  X-rays and those showed masses everywhere. His other leg lymph node was now growing with cancer. 

The dr said he was now not eligible for immunotherapy due to the pathology results and only chemo but he was too unwell for this.

He went from a healthy man who opted to have preventative surgery and radiation (as he was told 1-2 out of 3 times Merkel comes back) to dead in less than 5 months. 

His death certificate reads malignant carcinoma of unknown primary. 

As you can imagine we are stumped. During radiation they were constantly doing xrays of his chest... he had not had any known cancer or symptoms before his therapies.

What would be the scenarios for this outcome. I know that radiation usually takes decades to cause secondary cancers? I just have no idea how this can happen in this way.

Could have have had an undiagnosed cancer all along which jeopardised his immune system causing the melanomas and Merkel cell ?

Does the location of the lymph node indicate location of a primary? (He has an abdominal scan which was clear too when in hospital)

We have no answers. :(

68,Question about immunotherapy,"My brother in law recently started taking Keytruda as treatment and I was curious to learn more about this drug. From what I understand, there's a protein called PD-1 which tells our immune cells to stop attacking the cancer if it attaches to another protein that cancer cells makes. But Keytruda stops this from happening by itself attaching to PD-1 (blocking PD-L1). But wouldn't this also just lead to the immune cells receiving a signal to stop attacking the cancer?

70,Bile duct cancer??Found out my dad has it.,"Hey Happy New Year to all.  Unfortunately I found out with my father being admitted to the hospital Saturday with Jaundice, that it’s not liver cancer that my parents wanted to sugarcoat to me rather bile duct cancer. My dad is 77 years old who for 40 years has dealt with diabetes, Thyroid cancer (removal in 1981),  open heart surgery, stomach cancer (recession done in 2016), and now 3 years later he discovered from a routine quarterly blood test that his alkaline phosphate was at 188 rather than 43 at his last blood test. Since then which was one month he has been to see a prominent surgeon who deals with transplants each week and also a professor at the medical school, told my father that from the CAT scan, MRI, and other reports that the tumor is 3mm large and he cannot operate until it’s shrunk to 2 mm.  It’s in a difficult place unless the tumor is shrunk. He also has other options but removal would be the best alternative. Being that the bile duct is blocked, they tried to install a stent to help the bile in its process but after some poking and prodding that ducts became swollen and he couldn’t put in the stent but the doctor who performed the endoscopy believes that he can do it tomorrow on another attempt now that he has my father’s anatomy mapped out so to speak.  My question to anyone in this subreddit have you dealt with bile duct cancer and what has been the success rate on chemotherapy shrinking tumor in the bile duct? Any information would be great before I accompany my parents to the first appointment to the oncologist for his consultation for the chemotherapy. Not because he’s my dad but the man has been through a lot and he not a person to give up and being this cancer is so rare ( 8,000 people last year in US), I firgure I reach out to my Reddit world for some help. Thanks for any information and take care of yourselves. "

73,Not cancer but benign tumors. Does the immune system work in the brain and attack benign brain tumors?,"Or does the immune system not recognize benign brain cancers as a threat so doesn't attack it? As a 23 year old male just had an 11 hr operation to remove benign meningioma from brain so I have a head wound now, recently got staples removed as well as titanium implant. Neurosurgeons removed as much as they could and MRI afterwards did not detect anything there. I have 2 more operations for same meningioma in nose area and cheek area. Cheek area gave my right eye a lazy eye appearance and glasses/contacts do not work on it, I'm near-sighted. After cheek surgery will my right ""lazy eye"" shift back to normal position? Doesn't seem like eye doc is involved in surgery but plastic surgeon is (not sure if for cheek, nose area, or both). And following my 11 hr brain surgery why did my neurosurgeon say my immune system isn't weak now? Mine is normally strong as I hardly ever get sick. I did research online that the immune system takes a major hit following any major surgery. So why isn't mine the same as before op?

&#x200B;

We currently focus on subcutaneous tumour, leukaemia and animal weight studies but we are able to adapt the software to many experiment types as necessary.

&#x200B;

We are keen to speak with in vivo researchers who currently use older approaches such as spreadsheets or paper and pen to track their studies so we can demonstrate the time savings and convenience of the statistical analysis, but also to gather feedback and suggestions as we always involve researchers with our development pipeline.

He called me back a week before the appointment and asked my why I thought I need to be tested again. I explained that I believe either he or my PCP told me that it was necessary at this time. He told me I don't have MM so I should not be worried. I called my PCP's office to verify and his records show my MM is in remission. This sound absurd I believe.

90,Question about the study that linked vitamin B and lung cancer in male smokers,"Hello everyone. This sub seems kinda dead but i think it would worth to try.

I recently found a study that linked high intake of vitamin B supplementation to a higher risk of developing lung cancer, however it seemed very ""sensationalist"" and i got really scared of it to be honest.

The study i am talking about is this one for reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28829668/
 

Im a 27 year old male and smoker. Been smoking since i was 16. I probably have less than 20 pack years. What made me really nervous is that i found out about this study moments after receiving a massive B6 and B12 shot because i was actually deficient in vitamin B. And when i say massive it was really massive... 5000mcg of B12 and i dont remember exactly how much of B6. I was already experiencing symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. But i quickly regretted taking this shot now.

 According to that study (which can be seen in more detail here: https://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/news/20170822/do-common-vitamins-raise-lung-cancer-risk ) a male smoker have pretty much over 90% chance of getting a lung cancer? That means that pretty much every male smoker who took vitamin B supplementation would die? Those numbers seems very confusing and they dont tell how many people were taking vitamin B supplements in total. They just tell that out of 77 thousand people who participated in that study about general vitamin supplementation, 800 of them took vitamin B6 and B12 and got cancer. I also know that the majority of people who got diagnosed with cancer were in average older and smoked more.

I've been wanting to quit smoking for a while and after seeing this im planning to quit this month and i already dramatically reduced the number of cigarettes... but maybe im doomed already? Should i worry/panic about this? Should i get screened for lung cancer in the coming years? Am i at high risk?

This is both a curious question about the study numbers itself and a personal question since im a smoker.

I know this is kind of a dumb question for this sub-reddit. But i would really like an opinion from someone who actually know about these things instead of believing and panicking about an study  that i may be misinterpreting.

116,"Self Examination is Best Tool to Detect Early Signs of Cancer, Say Doctors","In today’s fast life, there is no time for us to look at the changes in our body. This is not right. Our body must be examined properly for abnormal lumps, bumps, masses, changes in skin colour and texture of different body parts, a sudden change in bowel habits and unexplained loss of weight. These can be symptoms of cancer and if early detected, the chance of cure is much more. Ask any cancer specialist if you want to know more details about this. Here we will briefly discuss the process of self-examination of two parts of the body for symptoms of cancer.
Testicular Self-Examination
After a hot shower or bath, you must perform testicular self-examination as that time your scrotum is more relaxed. Roll the testicle back and forth by using your middle and index finger behind it. You must remember to roll your thumb over the top of the testicle to stabilize it and use both hands. Look for lumps or an enlarged swollen testicle. Keep in mind to examine one testicle at a time.
Breast Self-Examination
In both standing and lying down position you should perform the breast self-examination. If your breasts are symmetric or one breast is slightly different from the other, it is not much alarming. It is of concern and may indicate cancer if there is a greater breast asymmetry. All the way down to the bra-line and around to the armpits, palpate the breast tissue from the collarbone by applying firm, circular motions by the flat parts of your fingers. Watch for any abnormal lumps, dimpling or retractions on the skin which can be symptoms of cancer.

118,Stages of colon cancer life expectancy,"There are several methods on the basis of which colon cancer can be staged. You can know about them from a cancer specialist. TNM classification and Dukes staging are the two most common methods. Colon and rectal cancer are divided into three stages on the basis of Dukes classification. These stages are A, B and C. From mucosa, the inner lining of the colon, colon cancers originate. As the growth of cancer continues, it grows larger in the lumen of the colon. The outer layers composing the wall of the colon are invaded by it and other structures and lymph nodes can also get affected. Other organs such as the liver are areas where colon cancer IQ can spread.
A detailed explanation of different stages
The muscular lining of the intestinal wall is the area in which Dukes A colon cancer remains confined. Cancer grows beyond the muscular layer of the bowel wall in Dukes B colon cancer and cancer spreads to involve the lymph nodes in Dukes C colon cancer.
Colon cancer is classified in a more precise fashion by TNM classification. The tumor is represented by “T” and depending on the depth of cancer invasion into the bowel wall, cancer is placed in one of seven groups. The lymph node is denoted by “N” and depending on whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and how many lymph nodes that are involved, a tumor is given “N” ranking. When cancer is spread to other organs to other organs far from the colon and the lymph nodes, it is related to “M”.
The tumor is confined to the bowel in stage I colon cancer, similar to Dukes A colon cancer. Cancer grows beyond the muscular layer of the bowel wall in stage II colon cancer, similar to Dukes B colon cancer. Cancer spreads to lymph nodes in stage III colon cancer, similar to Dukes C colon cancer. Cancer spreads to distant organs in stage IV colon cancer.
Survival rates
The following are survival rates based on a period of 5 years in different stages of colon cancer:
• The 5-year relative survival rate is about 92% in stage I colon cancer.
• The 5-year relative survival rate is about 87% in stage IIA colon cancer and the survival rate is about 63% in stage IIB colon cancer.
• For stage IIIA colon cancers, the 5-year relative survival rate is about 89%. The survival rate is about 69% for stage IIIB colon cancer and the survival rate is about 53% for stage IIIC colon cancer.
• The 5-year relative survival rate is about 11% in stage IV colon cancer.

123,The Genetics of Cancer,"It is found that hereditary predisposition is associated with only about one in ten cases of cancer. This is found according to current estimates. Cancer is not inherited.

There are a number of members in almost every family who suffer from cancer. But the meaning of this is not that families have a hereditary preposition to cancer. The combined effect of hereditary as well as external influences, such as environmental and lifestyle factors, is the cause of the origin of the vast majority of cancer cases.

Cancer can be the result of the genetic defect which is inherited. The meaning is that the predisposition to cancer or increased risk can be inherited. The best oncologist can explain you more about this topic.

It is not necessary that an inherited genetic defect is passed on to all members of the same family. It is also not that cancer will develop in everyone who receives the same defective gene.

It must also be remembered that the genetic changes, which occur in cancerous tumours are not passed on genetically to one’s offspring.

How is hereditary cancer identified?
By the onset of cancer occurring at a very young age, a genetic disposition to cancer can be identified. It can also be identified if the same type of cancer develops in many closely related members of the same family. Till now, some of the genetic defects carrying a bigger cancer risk are known to us. The investigation is still going on many genes.

Can we detect cancer with gene tests?
We can detect some cancer-predisposing gene defects with the help of current genetics research. But cancer cannot be found using gene testing. If there is clear evidence of a possible hereditary predisposition to cancer, only then genetic tests are used.

Recent screening showing a lump in a breast MRI discovered by hand as well during exam. Oncologist wants to wait a few months and check it again for growth, then do a biopsy if necessary. Oncologist is not too alarmed according to my SO, but still thinks it's worth checking again. As a SO, I am naturally anxious as all hell imagining seeing my SO suffer through treatment again or worse

My gut reaction is to ask for other opinions and see if another oncologist would rather do the biopsy now. I'm sure no expert, but I do know that the sooner a malignant tumor is found, the better the survival rates.

If you're an oncologist or familiar with these things, would you push for a second opinion on whether or not to go sooner for a biopsy?"

Is there any peer-reviewed evidence that outcomes are better with such supplementation during treatment and in the years after?  

I'm hoping to hear expert opinions, not skilled Googlers.  I appreciate the thought, but I can and have done that myself.

Thanks for any guidance!"

144,Welding and cancer?,"I am considering buying a welding machine, to repair some rust holes on my car. I just learned, however, that welders have a higher incidence of cancer, both lung and renal.

I am just wondering if there is anyone here who might know what kind of elevated cancer risk I would face, as a hobbyist? I would take all of the necessary precautions -- such as using a mask outside, and a fan beside me, blowing all the fumes away...into the neighbourhood...haha -- and I would only see myself doing this a handful of times.

So, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is it more like plutonium, or is it more like cigarette smoke?

Thanks in advance.

146,Pathway to Cancer Research,"Currently I am a Psychology student in Europe and I'm doing my Bachelor now. The issue is that with time I got really interestest in cancer research. So now I had this plan: Take 5 free electives in the Bachelor programm : microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology and anatomy that makes 30 credits Choose the Neuroscience track Then take the master in Neuroscience in which I also can take up to 30 credits of free electives maybe onkology immunology etc (please name 5-7 courses)

Is it possible for me with this plan to get to a PhD program in immuntherapy/onkolgy/t-cells etc.?

Or should I quit Psychology and begin a Bachelor in Biology"
147,The breakthrough of the microbiota,
148,"Complex ovarian cysts in mom with fam history, really scared","My 64yo mom (with a family history of OVCA, blood-sister dying 30 yrs ago at 36) was recently diagnosed with complex ovarian cysts in her health checkup pelv/abd ultrasound: 2.9x2.3x2.5cm cystic lesion with internal echoes and few septae in right adnexa and similar lesion 3.9x3.6x2.5cm in left adnexa, both ovaries not seen separately. No evidence of free fluid or mass in pouch of douglas. Enlarged/bulky ovaries.

Upon referring our obgyn, we got the CT scan with contrast done along with CA-125, CEA and CA19-9, FT3/FT4/TSH. The CT revealed bilateral bulky ovaries (left: 4.8x3.2cm with a 2.9x2.5cm cyst and the right: 2.7x2.2cm called prominent with no mention of cyst). No abnormalities in liver, gall bladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, bowels, etc. Above blood tests are normal. The only problem is her left hip prosthesis coming in the way and preventing adequate evaluation of the left ovary (again, nothing mentioned about the right one)

Although our gyno said she's little positive because of the good test results, they're not fully conclusive and we need to remove everything with a total hysterectomy+oopherectomy due to family history soon.

How risky does this situation look? We were supposed to fly to the US for 2-3 months on Jan 30, 2018 but the gyno says not to delay surgery, is it prudent to do it immediately or wait/monitor the cysts for 2-3 months? My mom really wants to visit dad in the US as she just got the greencard last year and is very disheartened/emotional/pessimistic if she has to stay back for a surgery and something bad turns up. On the other hand, I will regret if in case there's something, it advances and spreads in these 2-3 months, so I'm really torn here.

I have referred 4 obgyns by now, and all of them say it's my choice and that we can go to the US and do monthly/bimonthly USGs, but nobody clearly assesses the risk because it's so complicated to figure out how fast things actually spread in different people in case they exist. This is really devastating and I don't know what to do. I have read tons and tons of stuff online and know that no tests give a clear idea.

What's the best approach here? Any advice/experiences are highly appreciated."

My concern is that her physician told her they “got it all” and no further treatment is needed. I’m not completely medically naive and understand this may just be a wonderful outcome, but she goes to the VA and I’ve been generally unimpressed with her overall care over the last few years. I’ll ask more questions when I have unlimited talk again, but is this course of treatment normal? The tumor was removed from the breast area. I’ve just never heard of no follow-up treatment being recommended and I have trust issues with the VA. Seriously grateful for any and all feedback even if it’s just a “calm down”. "

152,Potential targets of Cimavax and Vaxira immunotherapy cancer drugs,"Cimavax and Vaxira, two cancer treatment and ""vaccine""* drugs from Cuba are back in the news today, evidently because cancer patients are going to Cuba (against federal law) to be treated with them (and who could blame them?)
Why are Cimavax and Vaxira (and so many other new and promising immunotherapy treatment approaches) effective against non-small-cell lung cancer, but not against small-cell lung cancer?
For instance, wikipedia says that Vaxira ""is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for the treatment of solid tumors ...,"" and that it targets a neoantigen which ""is highly expressed in several human cancers""--statements which seem (to me) to suggest it may be effective against other types of cancer (if approved for use), in addition to NSCLC.
What is it about small-cell lung cancer which seems to make it immune to so many otherwise effective therapies?
*Note: According to multiple sources, Cimavax is not a vaccine in the conventional sense: it doesn't prevent cancer. It's called a vaccine because it ""provokes an immune response."""

I myself am a male 22 years of age. About 7 weeks ago I felt a lump in my neck that I had never noticed before, since then I have felt it increase slightly in size. Recently had a CT scan which showed 3 lymph nodes surrounding my submandibular gland, all of which are 1.5 cm in diameter and oval shaped. I have had no pain whatsoever, no signs of illness or sickness throughout this time. Not even a sore throat. My doctor insists that it must be an infection of the gland itself, however last week I had my wisdom teeth removed and the dentist prescribed amoxicillin as a safety net, which is in turn also a treatment for the infection he was hinting at. After this he mocked me and said it must be residual inflammation from that, however that theory is also debunked because post wisdom teeth removal I had iced my face and neck 2 times daily for 4 days straight along with taking Advil and aleve.

Отзывы о Tel Aviv CLINIC,"Причины возникновения рака желудка (как, впрочем, и любого другого онкологического заболевания) до настоящего времени точно не известны, однако специалисты выделили факторы, которые с некоторой вероятностью могут способствовать развитию опухолевого процесса. К ним относятся: питание, в котором преобладают мучные, крахмалистые продукты, а также острая, копченая, излишне жирная пища; употребление алкоголя в чрезмерных дозах; язвенная болезнь, а также гастрит, вызванные бактериями Helicobacterpylori и доброкачественные полипы которые появляются на слизистой оболочке желудка обычно на фоне ее хронических заболеваний.

Нельзя сбрасывать со счетов фактор наследственности к сожалению, наличие у кого-либо из ближайших родственников рака желудка повышает риск его развития и у остальных членов семьи. Какими бы ни были причины возникновения опухоли желудка, самое важное обеспечить больному своевременное качественное лечение, которое могут предоставить специалисты ведущих израильских клиник. Грамотная диагностика, правильно выбранная тактика лечения, точное удаление опухоли желудка в Израиле все это привлекает сюда множество пациентов с самых разных стран.

**Преимущества лечения рака желудка в Израиле**

Основным фактором, который принимают в расчет пациенты, выбирая лечение в Израиле, является, безусловно, профессионализм врачей, работающих в специализированном онкологическом центре Tel Aviv CLINIC. Большинство из них высококлассные специалисты, которые обладают большим опытом, постоянно повышают свою квалификацию, следят за новейшими разработками в области терапии онкологических заболеваний и нередко сами выступают авторами научных работ, которые высоко оценивают по всему миру. Тактика лечения здесь разрабатывается строго индивидуально, в зависимости от общего состояния пациента, стадии рака желудка и полученных при диагностике данных.

Как правило, основным методом лечения рака желудка в Израиле является резекция опухоли, прилегающих к ней тканей, а также ближайших лимфатических узлов. Впоследствии могут быть назначены дополнительные методы лечения, необходимость которых определяется лечащим врачом. Профессионализм всего медицинского персонала, грамотный подход, уважительное отношение в Израиле есть все для того, чтобы каждый пациент чувствовал себя комфортно, а терапия была максимально эффективной.

Хирургия

После того, как врач получил результаты обследования и определил стадию заболевания, он обсуждает диагноз с пациентом и предлагает наиболее эффективные варианты лечения рака желудка в Израиле https://www.medicaltourisrael.com/?p=504 . Чаще всего пациенту нужна операция по удалению опухоли. Если случай уже неоперабельный, то в качестве альтернативы врачи Tel Aviv CLINIC могут посоветовать химиотерапию и / или облучение, чтобы уменьшить размер опухоли до операции.

Существуют различные методы хирургического удаления злокачественной опухоли из желудка. В зависимости от точного местоположения опухоли, её размера, типа, и объёма метастазов принимается решение о виде операции, которая будет лучше для пациента.

Перед операцией врач объясняет, какой тип операции он рекомендует и может нарисовать схему, чтобы сделать процесс понимания более легким. Обычно во время операции хирург удаляет раковую опухоль и небольшой объём здоровой области вокруг опухоли. Это гарантирует то, что все злокачественные клетки удалены и ничего не осталось. Операция может быть либо сделана с помощью традиционного метода открытой хирургии или лапароскопическим подходом.

199,Системное лечение рака в Израиле. Инновации от Tel Aviv CLINIC,"За рубежом есть методы лечения онкологических заболеваний, которые используют свои природные силы организма для борьбы с раком. Иммунотерапия активирует белые кровяные клетки, которые являются первой линией защиты от болезней. Белые кровяные клетки можно стимулировать по разному и почти без влияния на здоровые ткани.

Онкологи Tel Aviv CLINIC могут использовать иммунотерапию, чтобы уменьшить побочные эффекты от других методов лечения рака в Израиле http://www.israeliclinic.com . Есть пять основных типов модификаторов биологического ответа. Они могут быть использованы отдельно или в сочетании друг с другом, или в дополнение к другим протоколам лечения рака.

Иммунотерапия может спасти жизнь

Интерфероны представляют собой группу из трех белков, высвобождаемых белыми кровяными клетками, которые улучшают реакцию иммунной системы на клетки злокаччественной опухоли. Интерферон альфа лечит меланому и хронический миелоидный лейкоз, а также может быть использован против других раковых заболеваний. Интерлейкины увеличивают рост и активность иммунных клеток в организме. IL-2 лечит рак почки и метастатическую меланому.

Моноклональные антитела, созданные в лаборатории путем слияния двух различных типов клеток, предназначены для атаки конкретных областей на поверхности клеток, известных как антигены. Антигены помогают организму в идентификации микробов или раковых клеток, а также стимулируют иммунный ответ. Моноклональные антитела показали высокую эффективность в качестве инструмента системного лечения рака печени, рака пищевода и других онкологических опухолей метастатической формы.

Специальные вакцины помогают имунной системе организма распознавать злокачественные клетки и уничтожать их. Есть несколько типов вакцин. Некоторые из них содержат раковые клетки, которые после облучения не производят новые опухоли. Другие содержат изменённые в лаборатории антигены, предназначенные для присоединения к раковым клеткам. Противораковые вакцины используются чтобы помочь организму обнаружить и уничтожить злокачественные опухоли или для профилактики рецидива заболевания.

Генная терапия обещает выздоровление

Большая часть современных исследований в области онкологии заключается в обнаружении недостающих или дефектных генов, которые приводят к раку или увеличивают риск его возникновения человека. Современная генная терапия пока ещё хоть и на этапе эксперимента, но уже показала свои преимущества: Генная терапия атакует опухоли на клеточном уровне, что в принципе исключает необходимость применения лекарственных средств, облучения или хирургии Определение генетической предрасположенности к раку у отдельных людей или семей может иметь важную роль в профилактике онкологических заболеваний, прежде чем они возникают.

В основе генной терапии находится технология замены отсутствующего или дефектного гена на функциональный, здоровый экземпляр, который доставляется в клетки-мишени с помощью вирусного ""вектора"". Иногда в качестве векторов применяются вмрусы из-за их способности проникать в ДНК клетки. Затем эти векторные вирусы отключаются и не могут размножаться и вызвать какую-то болезнь. Генная терапия проводится путём исправления гена в лаборатории, после чего он вводится назад в ДНК клеток. В определённых случаях генная терапия может быть выполнена непосредственно внутри тела пациента (в естественных условиях).

Лечить рак в Tel Aviv CLINIC правильный выбор

Другие инновационные методы лечения рака в Израиле https://www.medicaltourisrael.com/?p=386 предполагают применение специальных генов, которые делают опухоль более восприимчивой к воздействию противораковых препаратов, а стволовые клетки костного мозга более устойчивыми к высоким дозам токсичной химиотерапии, минимизируя побочные эффекты противоопухолевых препаратов.

200,Лечение рака печени. SIRT терапия в Израиле,
201,Отзывы про лечение рака печени в Израиле и цены,"Люди, которые обращаются за медпомощью в израильский онкологический центр Tel Aviv CLINIC часто задают вопрос: ""Можно ли **вылечить рак печени в Израиле?**"". Наши эксперты не всегда могут гарантировать достижение ремиссии, но если опухоль обнаружена на ранней стадии, её можно успешно удалить. Это зависит от 3 вещей: размера опухоли, её местоположения, функции части печени, которая не поражена онкологией.

Большинство онкологических заболеваний печени являются не первичным, а вторичным раком. Это важно. Вторичный рак означает, что опухоль возникла где-то в организме и распространилась в печень. Это означает, что в печень метастазирует рак кишечника, меланома или рак молочной железы. Если это так, то удаление опухоли вряд ли вылечить человека, потому что раковые клетки все равно остаются внутри тела.

Если у больного обнаружен первичный рак печени, лечение в Израиле может обеспечить практически полное выздоровление. Если опухоль небольшая и локализована только в одной доле, хирург может удалить её. С учётом того, что печень имеет свойство регенерации, то в течение месяца после операции частичной резекции орган восстанавливается. В неоперабельных случаях, в онкоцентре Tel Aviv CLINIC существуют эффективные методы лечения рака печени, современные инструменты, помогающие если не вылечить, то успешно контролировать опухоль в течение длительного времени.

Есть несколько различных способов лечения в Израиле. Они могут быть использованы как для борьбы с первичным раком печени, так и для уничтожения вторичных метастазов. В процессе обследования больной сдаёт анализы крови, включая тесты, которые показывают, насколько хорошо печень работает. Выполняются КТ или ПЭТ плюс ультразвуковое сканирование.

Схема лечения рака печени в Израиле https://www.medicaltourisrael.com/?p=190 будет зависеть от ряда факторов, таких как: тип опухоли (первичный или вторичный), ранее полученная терапия, есть ли метастазы в другие части тела и очень важно общее состояние здоровья больного. Для одних людей цель состоит в том, чтобы избавиться от рака, а для других целью является контроль заболевания и симптомов в течение длительного времени.

**Лечение рака печени в Израиле** может включать хирургию, химиотерапию, биологическую терапию, радиотерапию SIRT, трансартериальную химиоэмболизацию и другие методы. Вид и объём хирургической операции определяется в соответствии с типом рака, его источником, а также наличием или отсутствием метастазов.

Хирургия часто применяется для лечения вторичного рака печени, который возник в кишечнике. Химиотерапия может быть рекомендована как до, так и после операции. Хирургическое удаление опухолей печени может занять от 3 до 7 часов. Из-за того, что есть риск кровотечения после операции, врачи и медсестры не покидают пациента в течение 24 часов. Большинство людей находятся в больнице около недели, а после выписки, дома продолжают принимать обезболивающие препараты.

Обычно процесс полного восстановления занимает около 6 недель, после чего человек может вернуться к абсолютно нормальной жизни.

202,Vaccine for Cervical Cancer Could Extend Survival in Relapsed Disease,
203,Лечение рака пищевода в Израиле. Отзывы про Tel Aviv CLINIC,"Факторы риска возникновения рака пищевода включают: гастроэзофагеальная рефлюксная болезнь (ГЭРБ), абдоминальное ожирение, курение, пожилой возраст, семейная наследственность, пищевод Барретта. Пищевод Барретта является предшественником аденокарциномы и может быть обнаружен с помощью эндоскопии. Люди, которые страдают ожирением или имеют эзофагит-рефлюкс, должны регулярно пройти обследование на обнаружение пищевода Барретта или аденокарциномы. Во время процедуры эндоскопии может быть выполнена биопсия для подтверждения диагноза. 

Врачи центра онкологической гастроэнтерологии Tel Aviv CLINIC рекомендуют, чтобы пациенты с пищеводом Барретта проходили наблюдение с помощью эндоскопии каждые 2-3 года, и если опухоль обнаружить на ранней стадии, то **лечение рака пищевода в Израиле** https://www.medicaltourisrael.com/?p=567 приведёт к полному выздоровлению. Пациенты с местно-распространенным раком пищевода редко имеют плохие результаты, несмотря на успешное лечение в Израиле. 

Клинические исследования показывают, что относительно высокая доля таких пациентов выживают 5 лет, и после достижения этого рубежа, только у небольшого процента больных по-прежнему остаётся опасность рецидива. Этот результат отражает высокий уровень онкологического центра Tel Aviv CLINIC и более широкое применение различных стратегий комплексного лечения рака пищевода в Израиле. 

Несмотря на хорошую выживаемость, пациенты все еще сталкиваются с рядом рисков для здоровья и должны быть проверены в течение по крайней мере 10 лет, если не больше. Эти риски включают в себя рецидив первоначальной опухоли, появление новых первичных злокачественных очагов и или вторичных метастазов в легких. 

Пациенты с рецидивами получают лечение рака пищевода в Израиле, которое включает сочетание химиотерапии, хирургической резекции опухоли пищевода и химиорадиотерапию, что по крайней мере обеспечивает 5 лет жизни после лечения за рубежом, а в большинстве случаев полное выздоровление. В целом, более 2\3 людей живы после 10 лет и только у определённой категории пациентов набпюдаются повторные рецидивы опухоли после лечения. 

При оценке прогноза, характеристики опухоли представляют собой наиболее значимые факторы, определяющие состояние больного и перспективу развития болезни в будущем. Это указывает на то, что продолжение наблюдения пациентов может потребоваться до 10 лет после резекции, учитывая высокий риск рецидива заболевания. Новый комбинированный препарат повышает выживаемость при запущенных стадиях рака пищевода. 

Пациенты, у которых метастатический рак пищевода был вызваны мутантным геном HER2, заметно улучшился ответ организма на лечение и выживаемость после курса целевой терапии препаратом бевацизумаб (Avastin), который добавляли к стандартной лекарственной комбинации. Бевацизумаб с функцией анти-ангиогенеза был добавлен к системной химиотерапии: капецитабин, оксалиплатин и трастузумаб (Герцептин). 

Это сочетание известно как CAPOX B T. Трастузумаб блокирует рост-стимулирующее воздействие генной мутации HER2, которая наблюдается у 15 20 процентов пациентов с раком пищевода.

204,Сколько стоит лечение за рубежом. Цены на лечение в Израиле,"Как правило, заочную оценку стоимости лечения за рубежом сделать очень трудно, но всегда можно узнать примерные цены. Медицинский туризм включает в себя различные виды затрат. Тем не менее, для многих людей, отношение: хорошее качество стоимость представляет основной показатель для выбора лечения в Израиле. Почти все клиники публикуют свои цены на процедуры и больничные услуги по DRG системе ценообразования в зависимости от типа заболевания.

Цены в Израиле одинаковы для всех больных, независимо от того, застрахованы через национальную систему здравоохранения или приехали на лечение из-за рубежа. Каталог DRG является основой для оценки сметы расходов, стоимости операций и больничных счетов. В каталоге DRG обычно указана средняя стоимость каждой процедуры, и это может быть использована для расчета другой части медицинских расходов. В большинстве больниц, стоимость госпитализации расчитывается исходя из стандарта размещения трех кроватей в палате.

Пациентам, которые предпочитают более комфортное нахождение в отдельной палате, как правило, нужно доплатить. Точная цена в Израиле может быть определена после того, как лечение за рубежом завершено. Важно подчеркнуть, что предварительная смета расходов, которую предоставляет перед приездом больного, международный отдел клиники не гарантирует эти цены и могут быть существенные различия в стандартах медуслуг, места проживания и предпочтений пациента.

Пациент, приезжая на лечение в Израиль, классифицируется как ""частный пациент', который оплачивает свои счета сам. Частные пациенты могут выбрать доктора и обычно их лечат лучшие врачи Израиля. Выбор врача повышает расходы на лечение в Израиле, основанные на DRG. Заранее трудно оценить уровень дополнительной стоимости, но она различается в диапазоне 20-30% затрат на лечение за рубежом. В международном масштабе, Израиль не является самым дешевым направлением медицинского туризма, но и не самым дорогим 

В условиях низких цен на лечение в таких странах, как Индия, Польша, Турция и других, то там, значительно дешевле, но в плане соответствия цены и качества, с лечением в Израиле им трудно конкурировать. Кроме того, стоимость лечения в Израиле https://www.medicaltourisrael.com/?p=613 ощутимо меньше чем медицинская помощь в Германии и других западноевропейских странах. Как узнать, сколько стоит медицинская процедура когда человек живёт в другой стране. Через Интернет сейчас это намного легче, чем раньше.

Цены на некоторые услуги есть на сайтах провайдеров медицинского туризма, но лучше всего обратиться в международный отдел медицинского центра Tel Aviv CLINIC, предварительно отправив выписку истории болезни и заключение врачей по месту жительства. Причём документы можно присылать на русском языке. После изучения информации эксперты Tel Aviv CLINIC предоставят предварительный план диагностики и лечения, и соответственно его примерный бюджет.

Полученная информация позволит человеку сделать оптимальный выбор в соответствии со своими финансовыми возможностями, а также избежать лишних затрат. В отличие от других веб-сайтов в инете, то, что отличает израильскую клинику в данном случае, это отсутствие посредников. Это удешевляет лечение за границей, как минимум процентов на 15-20. Нажмите на ссылку https://www.medicaltourisrael.com/?p=7812, напишите в контактную форму эксперты медцентра будут говорить с вами напрямую и вы получите исчерпывающий ответ как по ценам, так и по времени, которое потребуется на лечение в Израиле."

244,Question for oncologists,"Hi! I'm a med student (will be MS4). I've loved oncology for a while now (e.g. the pathophys of cancer, the patients, and I feel personality-wise I really fit really well with hematologists-oncologists). I definitely plan to do IM, then hem/onc. My goal is to be a community hem/onc. (I don't know very much, and perhaps my mind will change in the future, but right now I'm thinking, if at all possible, which I realize it might not be for me, but my dream would be to work in either in a medium-sized group or perhaps a hospital employed hem/onc in a medium sized city in the Southwest - e.g. AZ, NV, TX).

I apologize if this is too direct of a question to ask, but I wasn't sure how to ask it (again, apologies in advance), but I wanted to please ask:

1. Is it possible to work 40-50 hours per week (on non-call weeks) as a mid-career community oncologist? Is that common? I know new oncologists work very hard, but I'm hoping it's possible to have more of a regular schedule mid-career in a smaller to medium-sized city?

2. Do most groups provide adequate vacation coverage for oncologists? I ask because it seems very difficult for oncologists to take time away from their practice (really, I guess this is true of most physicians who need to see patients and depend on referrals), but it seems like it'd be good to be able to take some time away from practice maybe once or twice a year (for maybe a week at a time), to avoid compassion burnout, etc.?

Again, apologies if my questions are too direct or in any other way not appropriate to be asked. But I hope that's not the case. In any case, thanks so much in advance! :)"

I'm new to neurosurgery and still have much to learn. Recently, we had a patient come in with multiple meningiomas, that showed signs of infarction/central necrosis after unrelated blood-loss.
I have difficulty finding information of the clinical significance, or on the pathophysiology altogether. Is tumor infarction and/or central necrosis a good thing? Does it mean the tumor is regressing? Would this mean the tumor could disappear? Or are these findings a risk factor for a worse outcome?

Thank you kindly in advance!
