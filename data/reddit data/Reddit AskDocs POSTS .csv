"How to get taken seriously in the doctors office? It has been 8 years and doctor claims my spinal problems/weight loss are ""anxiety"".","

28/female/90lbs. No medication. No dinking or drug use. I have been going to doctor(rural area unfortunately) for the past 8 years now trying to resolve/pinpoint what is wrong and doctor refuses to help or diagnose properly. Experiencing lower back & neck pain to the point I cry. Experiencing weight loss & muscle loss(more than 30lbs). Vision has changed negatively.  Experiencing shortness of breath, extremely cold hands/feet to the point they go numb. Negative reactions in hot/cold weather. Trouble staying awake a full day.

My doctor claims this is all ""normal"" and it is only ""anxiety"". Is this really true or a copout so she doesn't have to make an effort? Spending this much time trying to resolve my health has destroyed my future. I have absolutely nothing to show for because, all I do is pay this doctor. 

I can no longer work at my normal job(farm labor 50hrs/week plus) and can no longer stay awake an entire day. It is almost like my body is wasting away, my muscle is gone. I can barely get thru an 8 hour shift(embarrassing).

2 years ago I found a chiropractor that told me I have the follow diagnosis: degenerative disc disease phase 2, stenosis, damage dics(bulging), rheumatoid, double rotary scoliosis. I do the treatment thing every single week but, I no longer see any improvements. Although this one has helped me I feel like there is more to it.

My only goal here is to get back to work. I want nothing to do with being medicated.  I had to get an office job that I hate and can barely do that anymore. Sitting absolutely kills me. The pain makes me sweat and overheat. 

I have zero support. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Edit:I had an MRI done and they found my muscles to be flinching. Unsure if that will help. 

Also note that this doctor has sent me to many many specialists but, they all turned out to be pill pushers instead of actually figuring out what's wrong.

I have been to several specialists who are unfortunately in the same network as the 8 year doctor. Everytime I go they push a pill and send me out the door instead of testing.

Edit: I have been to a rheumatologist...in the same network as 8 year doctor. Rheumatologist never ran tests...she looked at me and said I have fibromyalgia. I'm not sure how you can diagnose that from just look at someone but, okay. Haha"
I've been having extremely painful erections,"I'm only 14 years old. I don't use any drugs.

Yesterday and Today, for no reason that I can identify, I randomly got an extremely painful erection. I've fractured my wrist before, and the level of pain my dick was giving me was comparable to that. I solved the problem by masturbating it off, but it hurt like hell. I can't think of anything that could have caused it."
[NSFW][32M] The last bit of semen had a bad aftertaste (kind of like tonsil stones) and there were white crumbs in the precum,"I am writing for my husband [32M] since he doesn't have a Reddit account. Also throwaway for obvious reasons.

I gave him a blowjob and after he came I ""tortured"" him a bit by continuing even longer. Although he had already ejaculated at that point, after continuing he ejaculated a bit more. Only this time it tasted really bad. Kind of like tonsil stones. We have also noticed that sometimes he has white bits in his precum, but never gave it a second thought. I don't remember when we started to notice these bits.

As a side note, I [26F] get yeast infections regularly. I had this problem before I met him, but the last few months it came every time after we had sex (although he did the treatment with 1% Clotrimazol Creme together with me a few times, but as the problem continued we dismissed the possibility of him infecting me) and it has bad effects on our sex life as one could imagine.

Can it be possible for semen to be stuck? Or is this tonsil stone like aftertaste normal when you ""overdo"" it? I usually don't extend the BJs for this long, so I never noticed this taste before. Since this whole post is NSFW anyways I can also tell you, that I give him BJs regularly (like 1-3 times a week) and never noticed a taste like this, although of course there is a variation depending on diet. But this taste is truly unusual and seems to not leave my mouth."
Went to a Psychiatrist office for an ADHD diagnosis. They interviewed me and gave me a list of other offices that could give me a diagnosis. Can I get my copay refunded?,"Long story short: Me: 30 year old male. My therapist thinks I should be treated for ADHD. I went to my PCP because he treated me for depression in the past and I trust him. He said I would need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist before he could do anything. I found a psychiatrist; their website had an email address for requesting appointments. The subject line and the body of the email clearly stated I was looking for an ""ADHD Diagnosis."" Spoke over the phone with the receptionist, told her my doctor needed an ADHD diagnosis. They scheduled me for an appointment. 

I went to the appointment this morning, which was with a Certified Physicians assistant. I told her at the beginning, as I had with intake, that  I was looking for an ADHD diagnosis for my PCP. She interviewed me about my medical history, symptoms, etc. At the end of the session she gave me a prescription for Strattera, a list of doctors who could give me a ADHD diagnosis (all at other buildings), and scheduled a follow up appointment for three weeks.

Should I do anything? Can I get a refund? I don't know if I just don't understand how this works or if I explained something poorly to them, but I feel like it was pretty dishonest that after asking for an ADHD diagnosis at intake, and with the receptionist, and with the physician, that at no point did anyone say I'd have to go somewhere else for that.

I didn't complain when I was there, so maybe it's too late? It was an early appointment and I was late to it and had to get to work ASAP, so it didn't really hit me until after I left that they did absolutely nothing for me. I'm not sure if I should even take this medication that she prescribed after a 10 minute interview with me."
19 M Weird Rash,"19/yo male, lexapro 10mg, recently tapered off Ativan 1mg.
Been getting this weird rash whenever I exercise or get stressed out. It covers my entire chest and stomach area and sometimes I even get itchy on my ankles or neck. It goes away when I cool down but it’s really effecting my life. I am going through an anxious period cause of starting lexapro and tapering off Ativan but idk I’ve never had a rash from stress before."
Vomiting after drinking water,"16 Male, 64kgs 174cms.
This has happened around 3 times during this week. It's habit for me to drink cold water after getting home, lately whenever I drink water upon arrival I start vomiting. This has never occurred before. Would love some insight on what you think might be happening"
"Cancer, Crohn's, or something else?","Hi, everyone.

I'm terrified my husband may have cancer. Here are the stats:

Age: 47

Sex: Male

Former smoker (quit about 20ish years ago)

Occasional drinker (rarely to excess)

No real medications taken, except for a daily multivitamin, the occasional Aleve, and Pepto when needed

He started having GI symptoms this time last year - diarrhea and stomach cramps, some bloating. Everything he ate seemed to go right through him. He went to the doctor and got checked out; doc had him turn in a stool sample and took blood. Doc came back and said stool sample was ""all clear"" and that he probably was just getting over a virus or something. (I don't have much of an idea of what the doctor tested for) He went on the BRAT diet, and the symptoms gradually went away.

Now, about two months ago, he started experiencing the same symptoms again. He has lost a few pounds because of it. I finally managed to convince him to go back to the doctor this weekend.

Doc took blood that, this time, came back anemic. I think the numbers were something like...11 when they should be 13/14? Doc is now referring him to a GI because she believes the anemia is from ""blood loss from the diarrhea"". He has never noticed any blood in his stool - she also did not do any testing for blood in his stool while he was there. Is it typical that she would say that?

He's getting his referral today, and I'm glad he's going to go through with getting checked out further, but I am a nervous wreck over this. I know it's impossible to say what it could and couldn't be without having a colonoscopy/endoscopy yet, but would anyone happen to know what the first doctor could have tested his stool for the first time he went, when it came back ""all clear""? His mother had Crohn's disease - would that be a more likely culprit than cancer? Sorry, just freaking out and could use someone to talk to about it.

Thank you!

Editing to add: These episodes are not an *everyday* occurrence, per se, but they do last for days at a time, and have been going on for a while. Sometimes it seems like it depends on what he eats, and then sometimes it's completely random.

Also, I know I could talk to him about it, but I don't want my anxiety to freak him out..."
I woke up today and just fainted?,"14, Male, Not taking any medications
I woke up around 7AM going to the bathroom to pee, while heading there my vision started going black and I fell on the ground. I was still conscious while on the floor but I didn’t really feel the impact of the ground until I started getting back up. I got up with my back hurting (which is the perfect way to start your day) and went back to sleep. I really don’t know what caused this but I’ve been having this occur a bit more frequently now and is starting to worry me

Edit: Got an appointment for tomorrow

Edit 2: Doctor says that this is normal for people going through puberty. Told me to drink water and to give myself sometime before getting up."
Waiting 3 weeks for UTI treatment... [22M],"22 y.o male, 55kg (121lbs), 172cm (5'7""). So a bit over a month ago I started developing some UTI symptoms (burning sensation after urinating and discomfort in my lower abdomen) and was prescribed Monurol (phosphomycin), 2 doses. Pain went away but after about \~5 days I had serious trouble emptying my bladder (had to push with excessive force, urine flow was low and intermittent, had trouble starting the stream and had a permanent urge to pee, even the second I stopped peeing) so I was prescribed Denver (cefixime) for 10 days, the doctor mentioned it could be prostatitis.

Treatment worked well, all symptoms went away almost completely, but had very slight problems emptying the bladder some days (much less often than before, to the point it was almost anecdotical). Went back to the doctor to mention this and she scheduled a urine culture for two weeks later (today).

Since then symptoms came back about \~7 days after I finished treatment and now are as bad or worse than before. So I came back to the doctor again to see if something could be done but I was told results won't come back after ANOTHER WEEK and I couldn't get another round of antibiotics until then.

Now I fear that even after waiting another week the tests may come back negative. **Are urine cultures even useful if the infection is in my prostate?** I'd hate to wait even more weeks for another test while not being treated, it's already been a more than a month and I don't even understand why I wasn't on the second round of antibiotics for longer since I still had some lingering symptoms...

Any advice? :/"
Wierd pain in lower right abdomen,"Been there for about 3 days, getting worse everyday. Sometimes disappears for a little bit but then comes back a bit worse rhan before. Moves up my side sometimes, too. When I twist or anything like that I fell a sharp pain around that area

I’m actually dying waiting for my neurology appointment (not an exaggeration). What do I do please?,"27F
5’3”
110lbs
White
Complaint: paralysis of left foot, left hand, jaw, tongue, swallowing issues, rapid heart rate, intense vomiting, tremoring
Duration: months - getting worse very fast 
Location: neuro issue
No diagnosis
No medications 
No smoking or drugs or drinking

I’m a 27 year old female and I am dying at a medium rate so I can’t be helped at the ER and the neurologist I need to see is scheduled months out and does not offer urgent appointments.

I am actually passing away waiting for this appointment and do not know what to do.

I went from having weakness in my left foot and hand to total paralysis there.

I cannot chew my food or swallow it.

I can get water down through choking on it and when I get it in me I  throwing it up along with bright yellow bile.

This is occurring every day.

My HR is consistently over 120 and my blood pressure is very high constantly.

I am fainting every time I stand up and try to walk.

All I can do is lay in bed drooling from my month because I cannot manage my saliva.

I can’t take this anymore and do not know what to do.

I am insanely insanely sick.

I can’t walk a normal distance or take care of myself due to the paralyzed hand. 

I am just laying on my side drooling and throwing up into a garbage can on the floor/ dry heaving because there is nothing in me. My jaw muscle is weak so my face is just trembling as I throw up.

I truly cannot take this suffering anymore especially without knowing what is going on. 

My 02 has been dipping in my sleep and I wake up very dizzy. 

I have had my referring neuros call the neurologist I need to see and he under no circumstances will offer an urgent appointment.

I went to the ER just to see what they could do and they did nothing and sent me home.

I do not feel safe and am unable to tolerate the amount of suffering I am experiencing.

I am extremely hungry but my jaw/ tongue is too weak to eat normal foods and am not swallowing ok.

What do I do? The ER is just telling me they can’t do anything but can nobody admit me to get me help? I am desperate for help.

The neurologist appointment is in 3 months and I do not have that long I am losing functioning daily.

How do they determine if you get admitted to the hospital? 

Do only diagnosed issues get admitted? What can I do?"
"As a kid, I used to get frequent episodes of what appeared to be a stomach bug - Haven't had one in 3 years?","21M 5'9"" 155lbs White  


As a kid, starting young up until right before college, I used to get these bugs a few times a year where I would wake up in the middle of the night or early with a terrible taste in my mouth, and then go to the bathroom before starting an only day to half day long ordeal of throwing up, diarrhea, and terrible stomach pains. These were the only recurring symptoms that I can recall. My doctors would jump between ""stress"" and ""a bug"", but since I've been to college I've had a variety of illnesses(nothing abnormal, but a bit more varied, being exposed to a LOT more people every day now) and nothing like this. I have not had one nauseous throwing up episode from any disease at all, as a matter of fact.   


Are there any conditions that you know of that sound similar to this? Could it be nutrition related? Are there allergic reactions that sound like this? Developmental conditions?"
"Heart attack, anxiety, or something else?","I’m 24, female. I don’t smoke, I drink very occasionally, I’m 158 cm tall and weigh 52 kg. I’m not on any meds although I’ve had anxiety issues (including anxiety attacks) during the past year. I went on a 13 hour flight today so I’ve been fairly stressed out for the past 24 hours. In the evening after I got back to my hotel my heart started racing a bit and I’ve been feeling pressure on my chest, particularly on the left side, although I can breathe normally. I’ve had both rapid heartbeats and this strange pressure on my heart before but never at the same time and for such a long time (it’s been around 3 hours). I told my dad and he said it’s probably just the stress and told me to take some Tranxilium, so I did. It might be a stupid question but I’m kind of concerned that the symptoms might have to do with a heart attack? I do have a history of anxiety and I’ve had a really long day running on little sleep, but I’m still a bit worried."
Radiology results. Does that mean cancer?,"I am a Male, 47 years old. 5'11"" tall and 218 lbs weight. Living in the USA. Alcoholic, drinking heavily for a few years. Now sober for almost 2 months. 

I have been having abdominal pains that are similar to Gastritis, so went to get an Ultrasound. My primary doctor is terrible and won't get back to me until next appointment I could get with her in another 3 weeks. 

My ultrasound result shows:

**The liver is hyperechoic and heterogeneous in its echotexture which can be seen with hepatic steatosis as well as hepatocellular disease. No focal intrahepatic mass. The intrahepatic ducts are not dilated.**

My blood test shows

* **Albumin: 4.7**
* **Total protein: 7.7**
* **ALT: 83**
* **AST: 33**
* **ALP: 60**
* **Bilirubin: 1.2**
* **No Hepatitis**
* **CBC are all in range**

I am trying to decipher if radiologist is saying that my liver is actually showing fatty liver and cancer or showing signs that could apply to fatty liver or cancer.

"Used a penis plug for the first time, had some bleeding, should I see a doctor?","28 Male, I weigh 135 lb, I take adderall 20mg,  

It was a long one with many ribs and I got a bit excited and bumped it and it hurt. For the record it looked like this  [https://www.thechaingang.com/brooks-ball-sounding-plug.html](https://www.thechaingang.com/brooks-ball-sounding-plug.html)   
 and it was a bit long for me.

The pain is bearable.

I ejaculated with it on and had a little blood in my ejaculate. After about 1.5 hours I ejaculated again, no blood, but I didn't ejaculate as hard as the first time (obviously), no sign of blood. Peed after first ejaculate, irregular, now when I pee it's fine but it burns.

 I'ts been 12 hours since and the pain is still there. I can't tell if there is blood in my pee, and I ejaculated a few times since and no blood.

It's not getting worse, and I read that soreness is normal.

I need to know if this a medical emergency, or if I should give it a few days to see if it get's better.

Honestly the worst part is my own fear of infection (now that it's after the fact that I did something this stupid) and even thinking about, almost causes me to faint and panic, I honestly almost fainted typing this stuff down."
Am I being taken seriously?,"Hi, I’m 5’11’’  194 pound male. I weight train 3 days a week and do HIIT once a week. I don’t take any medication and I supplement with vitamin d, creatine, and protein.

Over the past 10 years I’ve had intermittent unbearable pain in my abdomen that last 2 hours then goes away. I stopped trying to get it diagnosed because the flare ups were so short. However recently these symptoms have become less severe but more persistent. I also had an episode over the course of three days where I ate less and less until I stopped eating. I’m kind of normal now, but I have a pain under my ribs, and some of that persistent pain in my abdomen. 

I’ve been to the ER and a GI, but since the abdomen pain isn’t tender to the touch they just tell me to eat more fiber, for my rib pain they are planning to use a scope in my stomach.  I live a healthy life style, I already supplement fiber, I’m pretty frustrated. 

Whenever the doctors say they will run a test they phrase it like I can do this test if you want. Did you want to schedule this? I feel like their just trying to shut me up. Am I being taken seriously? I could understand some reserve now because an X-ray and CT scan provided no explanation, but this pain wakes me up in the middle of the night, and even those initial test were met with you “just need to poop” type remarks. 

TLDR: long on going problems. Whenever the doctors say they will run a test they phrase it like I can do this test if you want. Did you want to schedule this? I feel like their just trying to shut me up. Am I being taken seriously?"
Had surgery last Tuesday (6 days ago) - they out a hydrocellular bandage on it (at least that’s what I’m assuming it is. It’s about 3mm thick and brownish-yellow) and told me to leave it in place until it falls off. It’s still stuck fast (slightly lifting in only one corner) - is it still okay?,"Basically I just want to know if I should remove it or keep leaving it.

* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): dysautonomia

* Include a photo: no one wants to see that

Edit: the reason I am asking is because I have been wearing a soft crop top since the surgery to help stop things...moving around... and so that would also be contributing to the length of time the dressing is staying in place. If it’s not nasty to leave it be, then it’s all good though."
Numb feeling in finger tips,"Im 18M, 185 cm. 
I've occasionly had numb fingertips for 2 months, and i now have them more frequently. 3 months ago I started seeing things dubble, that went away within 2 months (the doctors didnt know a cause for it, and didnt see anything abnormal on the mri).

"Foolishly used black market THC cartage, showing vape related injury symptoms days after","22M. 5'8. 140 lbs. nonsmoker. no nicotine vape history. no medications other than Azithromycin, prescribed today.

First, I now know these bootleg carts pretty much all contain some kind of toxic adulterant and are incredibly unsafe. Wish I was aware of these dangers before I used one. Packaging was Dank Vapes, which I have learned has been one of the worst. After this experience, I have no desire to vape/smoke/inhale anything again.

On October 3rd I bought and used it a few times that day. Last time I hit it, I was hit with extreme coughing and lung pain. Felt like my lungs had melted. I threw the thing away, and started to read about these black market carts, and got quite scared.

The next few days my lungs still hurt, with a slight cough and shortness of breath. Feels like my lungs are very inflamed and irritated. 24 hours later I started to get cold sweats, uncontrollable shivers, headache. Feels exactly like a fever but I don't have a temperature.

Wasnt able to sleep at all last night, and ended up going to a walk in clinic first thing this morning.

Was very direct with the doctor, told her I'm fairly certain this is a reaction from inhaling a toxic chemical from a bootleg vape. She agreed with me that it was likely, and told me I should get better fairly quickly. Thankfully my oxygen levels were normal, suggesting that my case wasn't as serious as some of the cases in the news. No xray other tests were done. She prescribed a 5 day course of Azithromycin and said to come back if I'm not better in 7-10 days.

I'm a little skeptical that antibiotics will help calm down the inflammation in my lungs. From what I've read, it seems that steroids have been the main treatment for serious cases.

What do you guys think? Are something like steroids necessary to calm down damaged lungs, or will antibiotics be enough? Should I seek a second opinion? Thank you all in advance.

**TLDR: Used black market THC cartage, felt significant lung pain/damage after first use. Threw the thing away. Next few days have cold sweats, uncontrollable shaking, headache and same lung irritation. Oxygen levels fine. Prescribed 5 day course of Azithromycin. Seeking advice on whether/when to get a second opinion.**  


  


&#x200B;

**UPDATE:10/7/19 Didn't sleep again, cough, shivers breathing got slightly worse over night.   Got second opinion and chest xray first thing in the morning, first glance shows either possible ammonia or chemical burn, possibly ammonia from damage done by vape. Still waiting to hear back from radiology.**  


**Received albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide, inhaled. Was quite effective, my breathing got better very quickly. Prescribed 5 day prednisone course, some kind of albuterol inhaler and Tessalon Perle.**   


**Doc referred me to pulmonary specialist to track healing. Said she was very confident that I would respond well to everything, given the changes after the first inhaled steroid. Still feel like garbage, but I can at least breath better now.**

[18F] strange pain during period,"hello, doctors of reddit!
i’ve had my period for about nine years now, and it’s always been incredibly regular and “normal”. last year, i randomly got a UTI-like pain during my period. after that month, i never got it again, and wrote it off as a random thing. unfortunately, it’s back again this month, probably more than a year later and obviously only for the second time. i actually don’t know if i’d necessarily call it pain, it’s just incredibly uncomfortable. it’s a definite “string” rather than burn or other type of pain. it feels worse after urinating, but will continue throughout the day and only be relieved via heating pad directly on my downstairs. i have a physical scheduled for unrelated problems i’ve been having, but just wanted to look here before i have my physician check it out. thank you for the help!"
Bug Bite causing GI issues?," Me: 34 yr old male, 160lbs, 5'9.

So this is a stretch but I've been having heartburn/acid reflux pretty bad for the last 2 weeks. Have never had either of these issues in 34 years. I went to a GI doc and have an endo/colo scheduled later this week, but in the meantime I cant shake this thought...

I got a really weird bug bite on my shoulder the weekend this all started happening. It took a week or more to stop itching, was like a really oversized bug bite and kinda hurt. Still seemed too small to be a tick bite.  I was in New Mexico at the time if that matters.

I've also had some muscle weakness and lethargy.

Im fit, eat well, exercise a bunch so im not sure what in my diet coulda triggered this. Poops are fine too now that im off the zantac.

Could there be correlation here or am I crazy?"

Thing: so I pulled back the foreskin while in the bath, and then I pulled back an area of inner foreskin bordering on the head a little bit. (It was around 70° anti-clockwise from my perspective) it was a small hole ish thing I created there, around 1mm in diameter splitting the border between the head and the rest of the inner foreskin. When I pulled back harder, white stuff (not sperm) began to come forth from it, the way soft clay pushed through a small hole might. It wasn’t liquid, not very solid at all, and is a bit hard to describe other than that. I’m really curious about what the fuck that was.

It’s just weird now that I feel I’m getting better all of a sudden this twitching starts. It’s also extremely annoying. It happens almost everyday and while I’m at work it happens almost all day.
18M graphite isn't poisonous. but after I bit my pencil in the exam I don't feel good,"I just finished an exam an hour ago, while I was at the exam I bit my  pencil out of frustration and well it was awful, and currently my mouth feels awful too, the taste of the pencil lead is still in my mouth and it hurts to move my mouth muscles and I feel like I want to vomit but didn't yet. 

Should I visit the clinic? I already washed my mouth and brushed my teeth nothing changed.

"Acid Reflux, Anxiety, and Sinusitis","Ok so trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. Let’s start from the beginning. I’m a male 22, not necessarily in shape but a tall and thin individual, 175 lbs 6 2. I’m normally a pretty anxious person but over the years it’s improved. Fast forward to 2019. I get diagnosed with Prostatitis, off and on antibiotics that seem to provide moderate help. So I’ve been depressed and anxious, always worrying about my health for the past 6 or so months.  Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I get a flu shot, haven’t got one In about 10 years but heard this season will be a bad one. So I get one. About 3-5 days later. I get this headache, and feel almost feverish (shown no abnormal temp however). Then I start taking tylenol to help and then DayQuil because I think I’m having mild flu-like symptoms, while also heavily freaking out that I have EEE because of all the news going around while it’s not even recorded in my state, was bit by a mosquito a few days earlier. I take it for 3 days and on the third or so night after immediately taking the DayQuil, I get heartburn. That was really strange to me and I thought I was overdosing on acetaminophen even though I only took about 2500-2750 mg in about a 24 period, I was still freaking out. So I go talk to my dad who’s a doctor and he says my headache which is almost exclusively on my right brow is typical sinusitis. I’ve personally never had a sinus infection, at least not to my knowledge. He took my blood pressure, did an ekg, and took my blood sugar. All perfectly normal except my heart rate, which for me is normally 80-85 resting. It was 115 or so because I was nervous when he took it. He said he wanted to see it down to 60. So here I am freaking out about that. He said don’t let your mind control your body and spiral everything out of control and let it become a horrible cycle. He gave me some propranolol to calm me down and lower my heart rate, Cephalexin for my sinusitis, even though I’m already on Bactrim DS for my prostate, and not to mention most sinus infections are viral not bacterial, but he said it helps, and some Rennie (antacid) for my heartburn that I got. Next day later I’m still worried and freaking out so I take a propranolol. Which while it lowers my heart rate, it slowed my respiratory rate too. Next morning I still feel the same and have a full blown panic attack, feel like I’m having trouble breathing. My sister comes over and gives me a Valium which really calms me down. Here I am today, a lot more calm but still worried about my heartburn/acid reflux that is still there, even after I eat anything acidic/salty/sugary or not (3-4 days since), and still have a mild sinus headache (1 week since). My dad gave me an acid reducer which I just took (Ranitidine) and still on my Bactrim DS for my prostate, along with Centrum for a Multivitamin. My parents and all my friends said don’t freak out, it’s just stress or the changing temps and pressures. Calm down, acid reflux is from you being all worked up and laying down all the time. Called the urologist to see if it’s the Bactrim, they said it’s possible but unlikely because I’ve haven’t had any side effects like that before. My dad said the gastro doctor said to wait a week or so and see if it gets better because acid reflux isn’t worth to be seen over, especially if it’s mild and only been 3-4 days. What do you guys think?"
30M - Need help reading Tumour AFP Marker results,"***Additional info:*** *I think this test was made because I kept scoring above the reference limit for IGA levels. I've also had stomach issues for the past year or longer; pains, discomforts, that have so far been treated as a non-celiac gluten sensitivity. However, even having been gluten free for the year, I still get pains/discomfort.*

My doctors surgery aren't very attentive, and even a phone consultation has a waiting list, so I just wanted to put my mind at rest in some way and get an interpretation of the following:

*TUMOUR AFP*  
*Serum AFP MoM 8 ku/L \[0.0 - 7.0\]*  
*Above high reference limit*

I've tried to interpret these results using Google, but the measurements given here are different to the ones I've found online (these results seem to be measured in anything BUT the above metric).

Discoloration of the tip of my nipple,"I'm an 18 year old female from Spain. My height is: 174 cm and I weigh around 65kg. I'm healthy, don't smoke, don't do drugs, generally have s good diet etc. The tips of both of my nipples are discoloured and kind of white. I realised this about a month ago. The rest of my nipple is normal pinkish colour although it's not very prominent and sometimes looks faded. I have smallish boobs (don't know if that is important). I have asthma and anxiety but nothing else health related that I know of. I also have kind of itchy nipples sometimes, it used to be worse and went to get checked and everything was fine.

Lightheaded in the morning,"Female, age 28, on Effexor 75mg XR (for about two months) and birth control

I wake up in the mornings and every once in a while feel lightheaded, tachycardia, sweaty, and fatigued. I try drinking water and eating pretty soon after I wake up, but I notice this happens after I poop (sorry for the info). I’m wondering if it is a vasovagal response, hypoglycemia, low blood pressure, or something else. It happens very abruptly and I have to sit and drink water for about ten minutes before I am well enough to get up again. I feel extremely tired all of a sudden and can feel it coming on, so I have never actually fainted, but I am worried I will if I am in a public place and it happens. I had a heart murmur at birth but no other cardiac issues have been diagnosed. My blood pressure is pretty low naturally (usually around 100/70) but that usually only affects me when I stand up too quickly. This is gradual, in the morning, after pooping, while I’m going about my moronic routine. Please help! I felt woozy for about two hours this morning which is the longest it has ever lasted."
"If I played guitar with poor wrist posture (in my left, fretting hand) and am feeling a bit of soreness and tingling in the left hand a couple days later, is that indicative of a serious problem or not necessarily? (video)","32 M here, 170 lbs at about 5'11"". Otherwise in good health.

I started more seriously pursuing learning fingerstyle guitar 4 months ago. In that time I have experienced what I guess I would describe as injuries on two different occasions.

While playing, I don't really feel pain, but then the next day my wrist might be a bit sore, and I might have strange sensation (maybe tingling?) for the next few days. The first time it happened I basically quit playing for a week or two and it subsided and went away entirely.

It happened again two days ago. I was practicing an arpeggio section and probably holding too much tension in my left hand. I also was not using my guitar support which elevates the neck of the guitar so that the wrist can maintain a straighter line.

Could it really be that simple? Even if I was only practicing for an hour or less without my support, is that potentially what caused this?

And is this a big deal, or, if it subsides in a few days, probably not really? I'm just not sure how common this kind of thing is. I'm not excruciating pain or anything but I can tell something is ""different"" with my left hand/wrist right now. I just don't want to make something worse (if I have some degree of carpal/cubital tunnel syndrome or something of the sort). Ultimately, if this subsides within a week or two and I feel basically pain-free and back to normal, am I safe to resume playing again (preferably with my support this time)?

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85D506Oc8-E) of what my my wrist posture looked like a couple days ago when I was playing. I probably did this sequence for a good 10-15 minutes straight without much rest (maybe longer, I can't remember). When you see my wrist, and know that I was in that position for that length of time making chords and whatnot, is it kind of like a ""no duh"" I'm experiencing what I am a couple days later, or should I be able to do this without experiencing those sensations? On a scale of 0-10 I'd rate the ""pain"" at maybe 1/10 and the tingling about the same. So it really isn't very substantial, from my perspective. But it is there."
Reoccurring infections,"So this is embarrassing, but I’m tired of it. 

I’m a 20F(sexually active) and for the last year I’ve had reoccurring UTIs. They’re getting progressively more painful and they’re starting to come on faster and last longer. The first one I had last fall was terrible, I ignored it and tried to just use OTC meds, that didn’t work so I went to the doctor. By the time I went to the doctor I had blood in my urine. They gave me antibiotics and all was well. Until the next one. 

I’ve been getting them every month to every 3 months and as I mentioned, they’re very painful. The last one I had last month they finally sent out for a culture and it came back positive for Strep B, I was given amoxicillin and it cleared up. Now here I am again, roughly 3 weeks later with another one. I went to the doctors for antibiotics and was prescribed nitrofurantoin mono/Mac 100mg. I have to take them 2x a day. I’ve also continued taking otc uricalm because the burning sensation is so bad still. I’ve been drinking plenty of water to try to get rid of it (and even when I don’t have one to try and prevent it). 

I was finally given a referral for a urologist but need to wait for the appointment. Are there any speculations as to why I keep getting them so badly?"
My mystery illness is ruining my life,"Hello I am a young man 31 rn. I have been not feeling well since my early 20s where I stated to develop fatigue and general body akes. This got worse as I got older. In 2014 right after a move I became so exhausted and weak that I could hardly stay away to attend classes or anything and I was super dizzy. My father is a DR wrote be a prescription for a steroid ( I really don't know why) and that helped me felt much better and like I had before that illness. All was well and good or so I thought with me still being very prone to exhaustion and periods of weakness but they would end on their own with rest. Flash forward to me completing internships. The summer before I started I got in great shape by running on the soft padded treadmill at shool. Then that fall my knees started getting sore and snapping and popping. I tried getting better shoes and such but no no avail. I tried resting them. Nope. I had been running be-for that summer as well gradually running more with no trouble. I then that fall/winter started to feel much worse, very tired more than usual. I went to different doctors and one did an ANA test that was positive. My rheumatoid factor was not positive. Dr wrote me a prescription for a coricosteroid again. That seemed to make me feel better and more awake again but did nothing for the knee pain. The next PA I saw did testes again and things were normal. I stopped running and just walked for months. Still nothing. I still Didn't feel well or right either. Meloxocam did very little accept helped me to feel less week in my shoulders and be able to lift more weights again. Then in the spring the base of my spine started to feel stange like I needed to crack my back really bad, it felt sore and my buttock felt extra tight. I felt like I just pulled something So I rested but that diden't help. It then started to snap and pop. And then the back pain would never go away which is my currant state. Its make worse by sitting to long. I though it was sciatica and I did work outs/ stretches and I got a steroid shot. But the shot didn't do anything. And all along my knees still snaped. The only improvement was my right knee stoped snaping but the left has kept it up. They looked at my spine in an Xray and said they saw nothing and also my knees. I know you cant see cartalage with an xray. I have been having horrible constipation along with more back pain and fevers at night. I cant think that well. I went to another DR and got an mri ordered finally and a new med diclofinac as well as merilax to help things to at-least not be dry in my bowls. That all seems to be helping so far. The last PA I saw in town suggested I may have Ankylosing Spondylitis. It sounds like a likely culprit and not just fibro (like my dad passed me off with) or irritable bowl. This new DR gave me the familiar look like I am just crazy. I am very aware this could be many things but I dont know and most people dont care enough to figure something out. I hope my mRI shows something so that I can get some proper treatment. And as I've told people many times, Im not looking for pain pills I want treatment for something that I know is real and ruining my life. I have no idea how I'm supposed to work after my internship is over if I'm so tired and in pain. Please help."

CC: Episodes of Deja Vu, intense nausea and foggy thinking, intermittent and irregular in occurrence.

Hx: 

Migraines since the age of 15-16. Most were related to the start of my menstrual cycle. At the age of 18-20 I started having severe bruxism causing tension migraines. For a long time I used imitrex prn but the 8mg SQ injection gave me multiple side effects even though it was effective. The 4 mg dude did not help at all. Relpax was semi-effective.

At the age of 21-22 I experienced multiple ""passing out"" situations, the most severe being loss of consciousness leading to falling from standing and hitting my head on the floor. At this time my roommate told me that I was making nonsensical noises repetitively for several minutes. I was taken to the hospital and had an EEG positive for epileptic abnormalities. This was in a foreign country I was living in for a short time (Italy). When I came home and saw a neurologist here, the EEG could not be duplicated by my US doc, but at that point I was already on Dilantin. 

Aside from the times in Italy, I never had another situation in which I lost consciousness. I did, however, have severe episodes of deja vu accompanied by nausea and a general feeling of mental fogginess. The deja Vu would be over fairly quickly but the nausea and general feeling of unwell would last for hours.

After several years of being on various anti-epileptic meds, my neuro doc said since I hadn't had any seizures in years that I could try to be weaned off.

A couple of years ago I started seeing a new neuro for my migraines. I explained the seizure diagnosis, the abnormal EEG and what meds I had been on. I asked him about the severe deja Vu episodes and he said that they are likely migraines. 

I have started having the deja Vu again in a more and more regular state. My concern is that these might indeed be seizures but that they are so intermittent that a new EEG won't capture it. How do I approach this with my docs? What is the most likely diagnosis?"
"66F- Sudden paralyzed tongue, not able to speak completely","My future mother-in-law, 66f, non-smoker,  weight-unknown, height-unknown, past medical issues- blood clot? causing her to pass out for six hours, lose her memory for approximately a month, and caused her to have epilepsy (although she hasn't had a seizure in a while); chronic back pain

 A couple days ago she started feeling like her tongue was paralyzed and she wasn't able to talk well. She says that she feels the paralysis in the center at the base of her tongue. Her blood pressure has been 150/90. She is not having any other symptoms and these symptoms don't appear to be getting better or worse. She saw a doctor who took a CT scan that he said looked normal and diagnosed her with depression. He discontinued her on all of her previous medications and started her on the following medications: Losartan Potassium USP 50 mg, Sertraline 50 mg, Piracetam, Levetiracetam IP 500 mg, Lexotanil 3 mg, and Ginkgo Bilboa. 

She lives in Afghanistan so medical care is extremely unreliable and can be downright dangerous. The doctors are generally not well educated. She does not have access to emergency services. The questions we have are: is this related depression? Could this be related to epilepsy or high blood pressure? Are there any other tests we can request to help figure out what is going on?"

She is an alcoholic and has ulcres legs, atrial fibrillation and high blood pressure. (She doesn't take her meds and I don't know which one she should take.) 

First symptoms were around Christmas, at first she couldn't move or stand on her legs. She could feel then, but hadn't the strength to hold them. This comes and goes in various digress, over various time spans. Sometimes she can walk and is completely fine; sometimes she just slumps on to the ground and just can't get up. One of those episodes last anything between a few secs and up to a week or more. 

She is pretty aggressive and manipulative, but can be super nice and calm if she wants to be nice and calm. And although she was 2 times in hospital, she just gets out every time. 

Now she is in hospital again, because she was on the ground for 2 days and couldn't move her handy. They found nothing in the first hospital, her blood work was normal (she had a low potassium level, but they balanced that). That hospital moved her into a care facility, because they couldn't find a thing.

Hello medical community of reddit,

&#x200B;

Yesterday I was up for 25 hours, talking to my girl cause she wasn't feeling well. About an hour or so before I fell asleep, I started feeling pressure behind my eyes and sinuses, but I figured I was just tired. This morning I woke up with a terrible migraine, complete right arm numbness and aphasia. I was struggling to find words, even in my head, completely jumbling my thoughts and using the ""wrong"" words. I could not carry a conversation or form sentences. I very rarely suffer from ocular migraines, and this kind of felt like one of those. My right arm felt completely detached from my body and limp, and I was so confused.

I also had a bout of nystagmus and vertigo.

I was kind of panicking, and I even thought about going to the ER because I was afraid that I was having a stroke.

It is now 20:30pm and I still feel foggy. Nausea and migraine is still present.

Is this something to worry about?

Recently I’ve been experiencing symptoms similar to an anxiety attack but some things I have been dealing with have been out of the ordinary. I have no past history of anxiety attacks as severe as these just generalized anxiety. 
These attacks onset around 2 weeks ago. During the first one I felt my throat constrict and my body shake and I got very warm and sweaty and felt detached from my body. I felt an overall sense of fear and this lasted around 3 hours. I had chest pain during the attack. 
 
Since then, I  have been getting sudden headaches that come along with dizziness and confusion. I will lose the inability to form sentences for a few minutes and I cannot take in any information. My legs will feel weak and I feel my whole body shaking. I feel constantly lightheaded and nauseous. My chest has also been very tight for the past 3 days with no give. 
I am very fatigued and cannot get enough sleep despite the amount I am sleeping.

Toddler (1.5) has a recurrent swollen eyelid in same eye,"21 months, male, 24ish pounds, Located in the US, no medications.  
  
Chances that this is just allergies is pretty high, but the issue is that it only seems to happen in his right eyelid, and it goes away and comes back every few days. There is no redness associated with the swelling, it just makes him look like he has a monolid in one eye. He doesn’t have significant allergy symptoms, I don’t notice anything different when his eyelid is swollen.  
  
Otherwise he is very healthy and meeting all of his milestones. He was always been quite small and skinny, a little under the 10th percentile in height and weight, but his iron levels are good, he has plenty of energy, so it’s never been a concern by his doctors.   
  
Anyway, this is probably nothing, but should I schedule an appointment before his 2 year check up in December?

For about 5 months after the procedure, I would have that random jolt happen 10+ times a day. Recently I thought of it and figured it would be cool to discuss this with a neurologist or Doctor of any kind.

So I was essentially homeless for a year between the age of 24 and 25. I had no running water and very rarely brushed my teeth during that year. I have turned my life around, and had about 20 cavities filled and brush religiously now. I use mouthwash and a tongue scraper twice a day but my tongue still looks like this. I do drink coffee constantly throughout the day, equaling about 5 cups per day. 


My doctor and dentist both agree it's a hairy tongue issue and is normal for me now due to elongation of taste buds, but I'd like another opinion. When I use the tongue scraper the color comes off my tongue but my taste buds remain elongated and the color and buildup on my tongue return by the end of the day. There is no discomfort in my tongue, it just looks terrible. The issue is also confined to my tongue, nothing else in my mouth looks abnormal. 


Is this really just my normal now? Is there anything I can do about this? I can feel the ""fuzziness"" on my throat/roof of my mouth and it's really bothersome, plus it looks disgusting."

I have had sever pelvic pain and nerve type pain shooting down my leg off since feb. I initially would feel feverish with it. I started not being able to put pressure on right leg at times because of it or walk. I was house bound... I also started feeling very fatigued like I had mono.

I initial saw doc for fatigue and they did all labs- I had low Vitamin D a slight ANA positivity. Went back for sever pelvic pain and pressure in bladder at night.... needed to get up 5x a night. Did CT for pelvic and abdominal (all good).

Fatigue got far worse and again pelvic pain where I couldn’t drive because it hurt to put pressure on foot (shooting down leg “like nerves)... Did kidney and pelvic altrasound - found large functional cyst - Dr said that is most likely cause so she sent me to OBGYN- OBGYN said the cyst is normal and non of my symptoms sound like cyst related .... 

Symptoms: I have been swollen 2-3x more in abdomen/ pelvic for 5-6 month (seeming to get worse) and I don’t eat much - not weight gain... my voice has been hoarse for many months and I feel I have a hangover anytime I wake up. I have not been able to be outdoors because I feel sick in sun and heat. I feel terminally ill. 

I went to chiropractor 12x  for musculoskeletal because dr said may be... but it didn’t do anything. It seems it has to be pelvic issues or why would I have swelling, pelvic pain, groin pain, nerve pain in that area. I am so tired now it is sometimes hard to even shower some days. 

Also had mono test... Dr ran 2 lyme a tests within a month because I had Bell’s palsy in 2015 which flairs up still... Not sure what to do from here .. :("

What do my lead level results actually mean,"35F, FTM 21 weeks pregnant, no other medical issues or symptoms. Long story short, we had reason to fear that I may have had some (limited) exposure to lead paint while pregnant and even more exposure prior to becoming pregnant. OBGYN ordered a venous blood test to be on the safe side, and I just got the following results:

* ZPP = 22 mcg/dL. No ref range listed. Note: Industrial Exposure: <100 mcg/dL (Refer to current OSHA regulation for exposure criteria.)
* Lead = 1 mcg/dL. Ref range <5.

All the Dr. says is ""don't worry, your exposure levels are normal,"" but I'd like to understand what these results *really* mean.  Especially since everything I've been told is that there is NO safe level of lead exposure, particularly for a developing fetus.

It seems like the lead level is in fact low? But I also found online that ""normal values of ZPP are usually below 35 mcg/dL"", so 22 does seems like it could reflect *some* exposure? Can anyone break this down for me or point me in the direction of a good layman's resource?

Why do I have snow globe urine in bottle,"I (33m, 6'4"" 180lbs, non smoker, no known health issues) was working in my shed cleaning out old items when the urge to hit me that I needed to use the bathroom I didn't want to walk all the way inside so I finished the last of my water and peed in the bottle as not to expose myself to the people outside. I went back to diligently working but as I went to leave and it's picking up trash I noticed there was a white layer at the bottom of my pee and still bubbles frothing at the top. I'm no doctor but it appeared strange to me so I wanted to know if this was something serious before I go to the doctor then have them charged me hundreds of dollars to tell me that this is normal.

Can smoke cause problems with my kidney?,"I'm a 25 year old man.

When I was younger, I would go camping with my friends and family, we would make bonfires, BBQ meat, sit around, and altogether enjoy ourselves. I noticed that often, at the end of the day, I would have stinging urination, but I figured that it wasn't anything serious.

Incidentally, I was having on and off bouts of urgent urination and inconstancy. Not directly correlated to my BBQing, so I didn't take either too seriously.

Fast forward to today. One day (when I had my bouts of inconstancy), I felt horribly sick and the Doctor ended up discovering that I have a *bad* case of (uric) kidney stones. I went on a diet and things improved.

Now, recently, my room-mate decided to smoke some fish in his oven. He opened all the windows, it smelled delicious (although, after my kidney stones I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole), but after about half an hour, I started smelling the smoke and started feeling sick again, when I had to use the restroom I felt stinging urination, and when I used my home-lab urinalysis kit (which I got on Amazon), I found that I had an elevated protein count in my urine. Less than a week later, I felt better again and my protein count was back to 0.

&#x200B;

What I want to know if there's such a thing that background smoke can cause problems for my kidney and elevate urinary protein, and what could be the cause? I don't think its normal, as most people are able to be around a bonfire without negative health effects.

**EDIT**

I couldn't take this to my doctor, since my symptoms went away by the time of my appointment and I know that most doctors *really* don't like self-research and self-analysis (for good reason - I have no idea if my home kit is actually accurate in any way!)."
HIGH HEART RATE," 

Hi

I currently take Escitalopram (10mg) daily and have been for 3 years now. I've also been taking Azithromycin (250mg) for the past 4 days for my bronchitis. I understand these both increase heart rate.

Today I took an unprescribed Adderall XR (30mg) with my Escitalopram, and my heart rate is at 180 bpm (20 y/o healthy female, 5'4) which is extremely high for me. I'm worried that if I take my antibiotic later (2 pm) that my heart rate will skyrocket...

It's my last pill/day for the antibiotic, should I just skip it? or am I worrying for no reason..."

Aphasia Caused By Stress,"32M, 249lbs, white, 5'5"", Aphasia for the last 8 months.

I've been struggling with what appears to be Aphasia for the last eight months. In the last eight months a LOT has happened in my life, but aphasia is still affecting me. In the last eight months I've had our first baby (8 months old now), I've left one job, got a new job immediately for new pay (to support new baby and my wife's decision to stay home indefinitely), then lost said job after 6 months, a month and a half unemployment, then a new job that I've had for about a month now...and it's just been rough In additional to that, about three months ago I passed six kidney stones and had to have kidney stone surgery to get out the last one causing severe pain. Now no pain is involved.

On the same token, I've been diagnosed Moderate ADHD and PTSD about six months ago and am on some new medication (but my issues with aphasia has been happening far before the medication) for my ADHD (30mg Vyvanse).

Description of my symptoms:

* Forgetting words, their importance, their meaning, and they're spelling (something I'm usually and have always been very very VERY good at!)
* Trouble figuring out which word belongs in a specific space.
* Trouble having active conversation because I'll forget a word mid-sentence.

I mean this kind of thing has happened before, every once in a while, but not seriously. Now I have this issue every single day, maybe three to five times a day. Everyone I've asked about it have told me it's stress related, as I have no experienced any kinds of accidents, I'm having no pain anywhere, and while I do have my maternal grandmother who had brain cancer, I've experienced nothing like what she's had and no health problems lately have existed. In addition, my paternal grandmother had Parkinson's, which eventually caused her death. Again, I've thought of all of these and compared my symptoms, and none of them match up. Literally the only condition I'm having right now is this aphasia that just keeps getting worse, more often, and is starting to seriously bother me."

Hi there, im really hoping someone can please help me. Im on mobile so please excuse any typos. 

7 weeks ago i lifted a mattress wrong and injured my back. After 2 weeks it was feeling better but then i woke up one day and could hardly move. The pain was severe and on the right side but there was no sciatica at this point. I went to the orthopedist and saw the Dr. Who treated me for my tailbone. He gave me a medrol dose pack, advised me to take aleeve and sent me on my way. The dose packed helped a little but not much. Taking NSAIDS does absolutely nothing. I went back after 2 weeks to follow up with him and pcp and began physical therapy. I felt a little better doing PT but then, 2 weeks ago the pain was so much worse. I couldnt walk. I couldn't do anything. I have a high pain tolerance and this was reducing me to tears. I was having extreme nerve pain in my left leg. I needed help getting dressed in the morning. I went back to the ortho and saw a different doctor who ordered an mri and gave me a cortisone injection in my back. This made me incredibly sore. He also gave me gabapentin which is honestly working great, but as soon as it wears off i cant walk or bend at all. When i went for the mri i got a copy and checked it out for myself too. The herniated disc was obvious but didnt look terrible as far as herniated discs go. Today i got a voicemail from the doctor saying the disc is indeed herniated but not badly, and its on the right side which doesnt match up with the left side sciatica. 
Why is the pain contralateral? 
Why is it excrutiating if its not that bad? Theres no spinal stenosis or other damage. I dont understand. Im waiting for a call back from the ortho but can someone please explain why the pain is so severe if the injury is not terrible? 

Thank you for reading and for your help."

Having trouble understanding people,"For the last year or so I've been having difficulty understanding people. I can hear them but it's like my brain doesn't make any words and I have to work really hard to make out words from the sounds I hear. I've had hearing tests before and they're all fine and I can hear fine. I can hear deep or high frequency noises easily. It's just that I have trouble understanding words. 

It's important to note that English is my second language, which adds a bit of complexity to this. I'm quite fluent at this point but when people are speaking to me I just struggle a lot to understand them. When I'm on a lecture, I can hear my professor clearly. However, if someone besides me talks to me, I struggle to understand them. Today someone was asking me if I was ready for a quiz. He repeated himself like 3 times and I still wasn't able to understand him. When speaking on the phone it's even worse. I have to constantly have the person repeat themselves so I can understand what they're saying. It's getting very annoying at this point.

When having conversations in Spanish I don't have this problem as much. Even if I don't hear the specific words I can still make sense because of context and the general sound of the word. It doesn't seem to be as bad in Spanish as it is in English. 

I was wondering if this could be hearing loss or something related to my brain? Like sound dyslexia or something?

So, I've been overweight almost my whole life and it wasn't really a problem for me. I have a great support system of friends and I'm on my weight loss journey (I was around 330lbs at my heaviest) by a combination of powerlifting and keto diet.

My main problem is that I don't think I've ever gone through puberty, my voice hasn't changed, my balls haven't dropped that much and my penis hasn't grown. I do have a beard which is why I've been sceptical about posting this question for a long time. Also, I don't remember a time when I was very horny, masturbating non stop, etc as is generally described as the puberty phase.

I'm very conscious about my penis length and it has been a source of major confidence issues for a long time now. It was actually the main reason for my motivation to loose weight and even after loosing a considerable amount, I'm not really seeing much difference. I have legit turned down hookups due to being insecure about my penis. And this is something I can't really talk with anyone.

So my question is, is it possible that I haven't gone through puberty? And if that is the case, what are my options? And even if not, what more could I do to take care of my issues?

How to deal with going unexplained vertigo,"I'm a 23 y/o student and have been experiencing some type of vertigo since mid June now (about 4 months). 

It feels like the world is constantly spinning around me to the left and nothing I do can make it go away. It gets a lot worse when I read texts and definitely worse when working on a computer or looking/focussing on screens, leading to me having had to quit my job and put my studies on hold. 

So far I have had several medical tests, but they haven't been able to pinpoint the issue yet (also the waiting list for a specialist at the hospital is very long in my country). I am wondering what this could be, and maybe if not even that, how I can deal with this and the 'gap' it has created in my life right now. I'm just very afraid of becoming isolated or get anxiety attacks because I feel 'useless' at times. I am usually a very social and outgoing person, but not having any work/studies/hobbies I can perform successfully for so long makes me really insecure.

So I guess my question is twofold:  
1. Is there anyone who has any idea what this could be?  
2. Has anyone experiences this and can you give me some tips to get through this?

I also have Acid Reflux but I’m not currently on meds for that. Once I reached about 250lbs a few years ago, I was very unhappy and I started to change my diet and how much I exercised. But no matter how much I would try, I’d loose like a pound or two and then gain more back, even while dieting and exercising. The most I’ve been is 299.8 and I’m down to 287.5 right now.

Is it safe to stop taking Lymecycline (for acne) due to side effects? 27F,"Age 27

Medications: nexplanon, Lymecycline

Non smoker, rarely drink

Complaint: recurring sebaceous cysts on face

I was prescribed Lymecycline antibiotic for 28 days, for acne (in the form of sebaceous cysts). One 408mg pill per day.

I started taking the pills 4 days ago. They are making me feel really sick and crappy and I don't want to be feeling like this for a whole month.

Furthermore, having researched online I've found out that this antibiotic needs to be taken for at least 8 weeks for acne (also says so in the medicine leaflet). Also, anecdotally people online say that it usually takes several months for it to work. I don't want to be on antibiotics unnecessarily for 8 weeks or more.

Basically, I should have done the research before I started. I did not realise I was committing to taking an antibiotic long term. I would like to stop the antibiotics and look into other more sustainable ways of treating my acne (I believe my acne is hormonal and I've since found out that these antibiotics aren't effective for hormonal acne anyway).

Is it safe for me to come off these antibiotics without completing the full course? I'm worried about bacteria resistance and my acne getting worse as a result of coming off the antibiotics early.

Amitriptyline - 10mg dose much of a difference?,"Male, 28M, approx. 6ft. - about 100 kilos, physically active. Non-smoker; do vape. Current medical issues: migraine, mixed depression-anxiety. Also intermittent insomnia, peripheral neuropathy. History of depression/anxiety.

Medications: Sertraline 100mg, Amitriptyline 50mg, Rizatriptan 10mg.

Just a tiny query regarding Amitriptyline. I spoke to my GP earlier and mostly wanted to query someone else on the matter. I started it for migraines because sumatriptan just didn't work and they were fairly frequent - Amitriptyline seemed like a no-brainer; it's indicated for migraines but also insomnia, peripheral neuropathy and depression.

Fast forward to a year later and I'm at 50mg. No side-effects but I've had to bump the dose every few months to prevent further migraines. It kinda helps with insomnia, makes me a little tired a while after I take it but nothing like it does when I initiate a dose bump - but still helps me go to bed at a fairly consistent time even if I wake up. Peripheral neuropathy not sure - it's non-diabetic and mostly just distracting tingles... it might have made it a little less distracting? Not sure.

I tried 60mg and it was more of the same; so my GP said go back to 50mg and threw in a different triptan to manage breakthrough migraines - rizatriptan. It definitely took the edge off but always wore off in a few hours. He said take two if necessary. So that's the new plan.

Now, since I've been back at 50mg I'm pretty sure I've been more on-edge and a little more tense - Amitriptyline is an antidepressant after all. He told me 10mg isn't really 'this or that'. I take sertraline, 100mg - I'm not sure how effective it is but like Amitriptyline it doesn't give me any side effects and I'm certain my depressive episodes have been a lot less intense on these two medications. I couldn't tell you which one works better as I've always taken the two together and I've always found I've responded poorly to antidepressants on their own. Medication is the best route for me, I've tried therapy and lots of other options - it's most likely genetic (family history incl. psychotic (capgras) depression in close relative), brain chemistry and perhaps even co-morbid with the migraines. Only other cause is perhaps stress, which is pretty usual for me.

Anyway, **I swear I felt somewhat better on 60mg, is it possible?** More specifically I've just felt a little more troubled/rundown going down a dose and well, a return of old depressive symptoms that are hard to describe, almost OCD-esque... a noticeable but not profound effect. I was thinking it could be a mild withdrawal or perhaps even the rizatriptan. All three are serotonergics but I don't think I've got any signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

Whats the visual difference between pimples and diabetes spots,"Long story short I'm 18 years old, with an unhealthy diet and with a lot of what i assumed was ""pimples"" on my back, when its hot (on a hot shower or outside) they sometimes become scratchy, and i always thought it was because I wasn't hydrated enough. But after reading a text that said that one of the first symptoms of diabetes was exactly that i became a little worried and googled it, but couldn't find anything of use

Is that anyway for me to know what it is without having to rush to the hospital, and should a worry about anything else regarding those spots?"

PTSD,"Hey Docs. I am a 51 yo female 5'7 200 lbs. No drugs, I vape ejuice, it helped me stop cigarettes a few years ago and I drink alcohol in excess about 1x a week, sometimes 1x every 2 weeks. This is not my main account for privacy purposes.

I have always had pretty severe mental health issues due to early childhood sexual abuse, rape, severe parental abuse. I went on to have abusive relationships and I have never really had friends because all the people I meet tend to be abusive in one way or another.

March 2018 I reconnected with a sibling that had just been released from prison for attempted murder. I guess I am an idiot for attempting that relationship, I should have known better but I just wanted to connect with someone.

She went on to kind of con me for money and things and was just . . . bad. It made me remember all the things that happened to me and all the abuse. I used to function fairly well but since that happened I don't. I went several months only leaving the house to pay my rent. I stopped seeing my PCP and taking all of my medications because he didn't seem to be listening to me, I felt blown off and it was just too much too take. I went off all meds cold turkey and let me tell you, that was rough.

A year later, here I am. I am in pretty bad shape mentally. I have tried a couple times to seek mental health care but it was pretty horrible. I can't bring myself to to try again, it just feels wrong and abusive and red flags galore. I really don't know what to do to get myself back on track.

Repeated sinus infections after an abscessed tooth/after extraction as well. Currently brewing another one and I need help,"25 Female

145lbs/5’1”

No other relevant conditions/medications. Former smoker, social drinker once a week. 

Last winter around Christmas, I had an abscessed tooth extracted. The surgeon said that it was draining into my left sinus, and the infection had bore a fairly large hole. At the time I had a nasty sinus infection as well. He told me that I would not need further surgery for the hole as long as my gums and bone healed properly. 

Since then, I’ve had about 6 sinus infections. The previous one caused me to develop bronchitis that I’m still recovering from after over a month, but I feel my sinuses filling back up with mucus and the pressure on the left side sucks (no pun intended). 

The sinus infections suck but my biggest worry is developing pneumonia or bronchitis again, that was absolutely awful last time. My doctor told me that this may continue to be a problem with how my anatomy is now. Great, but how do I manage this?

Is there a way to stop the recurring infections? (No new infection in my teeth, my last check up was a few weeks ago) 

If I can’t stop them from happening, do they need antibiotics every time or can I treat it at home better than I have been? (Cold medicine over the counter) 

And lastly, should this current sinus infection make its way to my chest, how screwed am I considering my last bronchitis diagnosis was just barely over a month ago?

I have been pregnant twice, miscarried one and had a healthy baby when I was 16. I smoke cigarettes and vape.

I have had stomach issues for the last 5 years. It started after having MRSA in a wound when I was 14, I was on multiple antibiotics for 3ish months, I don't remember all of them. Since then I've had increasingly worse stomach pain and food intolerances. I can't eat meat without being sick or in severe stabbing pain in my stomach. I can't eat anything with much sugar in it. It was manageable, but it's increased to the point that bread, some veggies, rice, and soup are pretty much the only things I can safely eat without pain. When I do eat trigger foods, my stomach becomes swollen and distended, and I have sharp stabbing pains, if it becomes bad enough I end up vomiting. It also seems to do with how much I eat, if I eat more than a small portion 2 times a day of non trigger foods I will still get sick from it. At this point I feel like I'm slowly starving myself, I avoid eating unless I absolutely have to which means 1ish times a day, and I'm exhausted from lack of food and from the pain when I do eat.

Anxiety and depression.

So I am 3 months postpartum and my daughter is exclusively breastfed. Around my third trimester I noticed my breast looking a bit misshapen, but they were large to begin with so I thought it was just pregnancy and standard breast enlargement. A couple weeks ago I felt an actual large lump and determined it was not a clogged duct. Got a mammogram and ultrasound and they determined it is a hamartoma. My family doctor, who ordered the tests, is now sending me to a surgeon for a ""second opinion."" I'm extremely nervous about what this might mean. Will they likely just do a biopsy? Does she think I have cancer? The hamartoma is 8cm. I'm afraid I'll have to supplement with formula if I need surgery and I've been trying so hard to only breastfeed and have been successful thus far. If someone could just give me some insight it would be very helpful."
Not sure if there's something wrong with my eyelids.,"Every so often, maybe a few times a week, one or the other of my eyelids is ""saggy"" for lack of a more technical term, it looks looser and it makes my eyes look like they're completely different shapes, I can correct it temporarily by pulling my eyebrows up, sometimes by widening my eyes, but they can also just droop again. It's just strange and I'm not sure if it's indicative of any health issues, it isn't just the one eyelid, it varies sometimes from day to day. I'm thinking it might have something to do with sleeping on my side, I alternate sides and stay on my back.

Where to begin...
I should start off by saying I had an episode like this happen at the end of 2018 which righted itself after a few months. It has only recently occurred again. In my left eye, I have been getting transient peripheral vision loss, happening also a little in right eye. A lot of flashiness too. Lasts for a few seconds and this occurs frequently throughout the day. In 2018 when this happened, I had an MRI with contrast which came back fine, and an extensive blood test and everything came back fine except low ferritin levels but no anemia, and high ACE levels. GP suspects sarcoidosis so I am on a looooong waiting list to see a rheumatologist. Also around this time, I developed rashes on my legs and one section of my backside which enlarged my lymph nodes in my groin.
Also should note my ACE levels ended up coming back down throughout the year.

Anyway a week ago this all started happening again! Went to ER and they sent me to opthamology. They were concerned about my optic drusen as it appears swollen, and not sure if papilladema or pseudopapilladema so I had a CT scan with contrast and blood tests. All was fine (ACE levels result pending). CT notes calcification optic nerve which I is likely pseudopapilladema.
They are wanting to do an eye angiogram, which I am super nervous about. Mainly because a common side effect is nausea and vomiting and I have extreme emetophobia. I am also naturally worried about anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest as these are risks for the type of dye they use for this test, a dye I've never had injected before. Any insight into this test would be greatly appreciated, as I am super scared about it! It's booked for Wednesday.
I am very curious about their wanting to do an eye angiogram, and a suggestion of lumber puncture was mentioned also. Besides the eye symptom, I don't have any other symptoms that could go along the lines of IIH nor am I a typical case for it.
Could all of this be sarcoidosis related? I'm also wondering if I could have lymphoma...Would that have shown up in the tests I've already received? I know sarcoidosis can be challenging to find. When the ACE levels tests come back I will be highly suspicious if they are high again!

Tests I've had in regards to sarcoidosis check: chest x-ray which was fine. Echocardiogram which was fine.

tldr; had a similar episode last year that corrected itself but has recently come back. symptoms: transient peripheral vision loss in left eye and sometimes right eye lasting few seconds at a time occurring frequently on a daily basis. Brain fog, fatigue. Rash on legs and backside, enlarged lymph node in groin on left side.

Any insight or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I see the ""what the"" looks on the doctors faces and I'm pretty worried!"
Strong migraines turning into seizures,"Male, 

27 years,

178 cm (5 feet 10 inches)

98 kg (216 lbs) – amateur athlete (former martial arts, now power-lifting)

South/east European

Started smoking 14 months ago, drinking rarely. 

**Primary complaint:** Strong migraines turning into seizures

**Existing medical issues:** deviated septum, sinusitis, broken nose 4 times, at least 3 mild concussions in last 10 years (martial arts injuries)

**Current medications:** ketonal 100mg, orally used per need, on weekly basis

**Explanation:**

Since I was a teen I’ve been having strong headaches that would render me completely useless until they passed. Last year, as the stress level reached its peak – moving from family home for the first time to another city, getting fast paced and demanding job, grandfather passed away, started smoking – migraines have gotten progressively worse. I get them once every month maybe, and I can feel it few hours before they come. My whole head hurts, I feel like my skull is crushed under the hydraulic press from the inside and from the outside. I feel like even having thoughts hurts. First severe migraine hit me exactly one year ago, I was on a bus between two cities, vomited from the pain on one bus stop, and then passed away when I sat back on bus. Progressively, with each next episode, my whole body started to participate in the dance. My vision gets blurry. My right leg and right arm start to jerk violently as in some kind of spasmodic contraction of the muscles, and last episode, maybe month ago, my whole body was shaking so hard that the next day, when migraine passed, I was sore like I was working out, my muscles were inflammated. Migraine comes in waves, every wave stronger than the last one, it lasts usually up to 5 hours and reaches its peak when I throw up. Throwing up is usually the height of the pain, and after that I feel much better, can fall asleep finally or literally pass out. One more thing, and I’m not sure if this is just subjective projection, few days after the migraine, I feel slower in the head, like the migraine had trimmed off a few points from my IQ, it takes me a few days to get back to a usual working speed. 

This is something not unique just to me in my wider family. Two distant cousins (both males, both between 35 and 45) from mother’s side have almost identical symptoms, without muscle contractions. They both underwent thorough medical examinations, but without any help in the end. That’s why I’m discouraged of visiting doctors myself, plus public health system is dreadful here, plus I’m a bit afraid of hospitals (I’m sorry, I’m a fool). 

Possible triggers that I found so far: stress, heavy weather oscillations (when it gets cold or hot too fast, with wind, I live on Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea), long exposure to very loud noises (Balkan weddings are a nightmare to me, 2 hours and I’m done). 

So what I’m wondering is how unusual is this, and is it a bad idea to go to a private clinic for a complete checkup? I really don’t want to listen to the same advice doctors gave to my cousins, which is something in the lines “just endure, there’s nothing we can do”. 

I hope that this is not too long of a post and that the language is adequate enough, sorry, it’s my second. Thanks kindly to anyone who might answer."
It Has Hurt For Me to Urinate (To Varying Degrees) For Two Months Now,"First of all, I am a male. 20 years old. For about two months now, when I urinate it burns a fair amount. There have been periods where it has burned very little or not at all, but also periods where it hurts fairly badly. I have been to two doctors about this: a general doctor and a urologist. I have had a urine test done and an ultrasound on my bladder and kidneys. The urine test revealed ""crystals in urine"", and the ultrasound showed nothing. I have had no abdominal pain. My pee seems to hurt less if I am very hydrated, and it hurts to pee even more if I am sitting down. After peeing, if it was more painful, a burning will linger in my urethra for thirty minutes to several hours. Sometimes when I have to pee, I can feel a pain towards the tip of my penis.

Any idea what the hell is wrong with me? A UTI was ruled out, and kidney stones did not show up in my ultrasound. This has been really frustrating to deal with me. I thought it was getting better about a week ago since the pain seemed to be lessening, but it is coming back fairly strongly. I have another urologist appointment scheduled for December, but I am really desperate to at least figure out what it is before then (cause who knows if they will be able to). I am really at a loss since nothing showed up in the ultrasound, and only ""crystals in urine"" was all that came up in the urine test. Could the ""crystals in urine"" be a key part of what is wrong?

Thanks in advance. If you need any more details, let me know."

Prednisone and Polyuria,"I have pretty severe nephritis from TINU. I was started on Prednisone, 60mg for two weeks, then 50, now I'm on 40. I had pretty bad polyuria with nephritis, but a week after Prednisone it started to improve. Then it got bad again...
Now, for the last week, I have peed with a full bladder every two hours, through the night and everything. I'm only drinking about 2 liters a day. 
Is this from Prednisone or are nephritis symptoms coming back full force?

Sjorgrens or just getting over chemo?,"Just looking for another opinion here. 

34F stage 3C colon cancer with 2 lymph nodes effected. Tumor and nodes removed in hemicolectomy last Nov. No signs of spread in scans. No genetic markers in the tumor. 12 rounds of adjuvant chemo Folfox with oxaliplatin removed after 6th infusion due to bad peripheral neuropathy. Chemo ended in June and my oncologist asked me to get a primary care dr to help track my health alongside her for the next few years. 

Primary care ordered a fatigue blood panel because I’m still pretty low energy and it’s been about 4 months since chemo ended. Was prescribed very low dose adderall to keep me going but I only take it on work days (5 days a week). Blood panel came back - vitamin D and iron good, CBC everything good, kidney and liver good, negative for Lyme and mono, thyroid normal, vitamin B12 slightly low. But I had a positive ANA result and a high SSB for Sjorgrens. 

Now I’m being ordered to go see 2 more doctors and I’m pretty sick of it. Before my cancer was diagnosed I was misdiagnosed with Crohns and I don’t want to go through that heartache again. My remaining side effects from chemo are fatigue, lingering neuropathy in fingers and toes, and increased skin allergies (already had these but they got worse during chemo...no dry skin, no rash aside from occasional hives). Just itchy pretty regularly. 

Anyway, is there any chance I’m still recovering from Folfox? I find it unlikely with my symptoms that I have an additional autoimmune disease that was somehow missed for my entire life."
"Electric nerve pain up neck, where should I go for help?","F/31/125 lb

I've had neck stiffness for about a week and needed general body chiro adjustment so I made a chiropractic appointment. The neck stiffness was, I think, from sleeping weird. 
So I went in to the chiropractor and left feeling sore but ok. A day later I was slightly reclined( laying back on my partners chest watching tv) and out of nowhere I felt an electric pain go though my neck. It's been 2 days and the pain is still there. It feels like an 8/10 on the pain scale but lasts only a second. It's not even like I have to turn my head for it to happen... it fires up when I'm very still.
I'm wondering if I need to go to a GP doctor or back to my chiropractor. The thought of getting an adjustment assessment is terrifying. Should I consider a massage therapist or physio? (I've been wanting to start physio for ongoing general body issues but now I'm wondering if I should start now for this problem.)

Race : White (Bulgarian)  
Duration : Past 3 weeks

For the past 3 weeks each time I go out after like 30 minutes of walking I get this small rash on my arms, that eventually gets worser and bigger and redder, it starts from my arms, usually around the biceps/elbows and from there to my shoulders and wrists. The rash spots(the small white circles) are mostly spreadout, they are not very close to each other, I don't get any blisters. This also starts to happen on my buttcheeks, and today I noticed that it spread from my buttcheeks down to my legs, almost to my knees. Also it only itches on my butt, my arms don't. But the thing is, as soon as I get home **everything disappears in less than 20 minutes**, as if nothing had happened to my body, literally while writing this it all disappeared.  
  
I have done some googling and the best I can find is some form of heat/sweat rash, which does make sense in a way, but the weather lately has been getting colder (with some random warm periods) and thus I am sweating way less than before. But even if I am at home and sweating a bit for some reason I don't get a rash.  
  
The only reason that could have triggered this that comes to mind is that on the weekend of 14th and 15th september I spent both days at this outdoor event, both days I was pretty much under the sun for like 10hrs straight, it was pretty warm then, sth like 30C both days, I even had to spray myself with sun protection not to burn my skin(which I didn't). Other than that all my clothes are clean, I have good hygiene, I change my bed sheets often, I don't take any medication rn, that could affect my body.

"37F Temporary paralysis followed by aphasia. Happened twive now, Doctor shrugs it off.","Twice* damned fingers.

Hi there, bit of a long one so heres a suitably long TLDR; 
My wife has had a couple of episodes now, around 2 years apart, but same symptoms.
Feeling light headed, like she is falling sideways while sitting still. Followed by ~30mins of full body paralysis, with only eyeball movement under control. Fully conscious the whole time, but unable to open eyes. Shallow breathing.
After around 30 mins, she starts to be able to wiggle fingers, a few minutes later can open eyes. Full mobility restored in maybe an hour, except for the ability to speak. 

She eventually can utter words relating to objects, but cannot express meaningful sentences. After a while, maybe 1.5 hrs, she is able to say words unless she is specifically trying to say them, and after around 2 hrs she is back to normal.




The first time this happened she had had a headache, and had taken 500mg of paracetamol for it a few hours prior. Obviously this was rather alarming and I called an ambulance, she was unable to respond during the trip to hospital, and eventually came right after being left in a bed and practically ignored. I arrived with the kids maybe an hour later, and she was just starting to regain the ability to speak. It seemed like the hospital just shrugged her off as a drug seeker, and after seeing me (6'5, bald, full beard) had a private talk with her suspecting spousal abuse. Of course this was ridiculous, on both counts, she hates taking paracetamol or ibuprofen even, and only if she really really needs to. And we have been married 8 years and have maybe had 1 minute of disagreement in the whole time.

So basically, as soon as she could talk again she was discharged and we went home.

The second time was a couple of weeks ago, no headache precursor this time, just feeling weak and then unable to even open eyes. I thought she had fallen asleep, but my daughter and I soon figured out it was the same thing. My daughter figured we could communicate with her via eye movements under the lids, and after what probably seemed like an eternity to her, that she had her neck on a weird angle and wanted to be moved into a more comfortable position. Also that she didn't want me to call an ambulance. Somewhat understandable after last time I guess.
We kept talking to her, and eventually got her to move her finger tips, then fingers, then open her eyes. Probably 30 mins in. Within another 10 minutes she was standing, and able to write messages to us, but still unable to speak. About an hour in she blurted out pizza (daughter had a tshirt with a picture of pizza on it). She was then able to say random object words (usually tangentially related to what she was trying to say). Words seemed to be crossing over, for example 'Tap' pointing at a tap (faucet for Americans) but un onciously tapping her fingers instead of saying the word. After about 1:45hrs she was still having problems expressing words intentionally (She couldn't say the word 'say' in isolation, but could say 'I want to, but I can't move my mouth in the way I want to in order to say it' without any problem). After maybe 2 hrs she was back to normal, but fatigued.

We saw the GP the next morning, who basically had no idea. Did a couple of balance tests (standing still with eyes closed she repeatably fell to the left side) but passed a sitting to lying with head turned test for inner ear problems?
He referred her for a CT scan which happened two weeks later, and she got a txt message this morning 'CT scan came back normal' and that was it.

My questions are : Is this the expected extent of medical care? 'I dunno, you seem fine, might be migraine related (even tho no history of migraines), here's the bill.' Or should we find a new doctor ASAP.
And has anyone any idea what on earth could be going on, or what steps we can take to try and figure it out?"

Hello, I spent the summer in a big city. I made a friend while there called B. We went out partying a lot, shared a drink twice. After the second time sharing a drink with her I noticed she had an open sore on her lips. Pretty gross but I didn't think too much of it. I had a strange throat thing going on this summer with open red rough spots on the back of my tongue. I think these allowed something to get transferred to me through the drink. Since returning home I've had very painful open sores occur twice inside my mouth. I am super stupid and didn't go to a doctor for them.

I've been putting triple antibiotic on them after washing them because just putting lotion on them like the doctor wanted me to wasn't doing anything really. one of my ears seemed to have cleared up after putting the triple anti on it but I noticed there's still a small crack. I'm just at my limit I'm sick of dealing with this,last time I told the doctor he just acted like it was bad hygiene but it's still happening. my doctor is a busy guy and I don't see him again until the end of the month. would I be able to call and leave a message about this? I'm not sure what he'd do or if he'd give me anything for it but I don't know what else to do??"

For the past few weeks I have been feeling dizzy at random times of the day, almost everyday. Lying down, sitting down, standing up.
It is worse in the morning, sometimes I have even fallen over if I can't fall to my knees quickly enough. Like the world goes sideways and I just tip over. 
This has nothing to do with blood sugar levels as I am not diabetic, and eat regularly enough, which is also why I am overweight.
I am not pregnant, and I have an IUD, but it is the copper one and therefore wouldn't have any effect on my hormone levels.
Just looking for any explanation or advice, and will obviously go to the doctor's if someone thinks this is serious enough. I wouldn't say this is impacting my life, but I don't enjoy the feeling of being dizzy anymore, especially when I'm sitting down."
Sharp pain in inner thigh," I have been having this sharp pain in my left inner thigh region, it doesn't really affect my daily life but when I stretch that muscle it creates a very sharp pain. It would only slowly disappear if I stretch for a continuous period of time \~1week. But once I stop stretching for a few days, the pain would be back. The particular stretch is when I put my leg up on a shelf/bar turning sideways towards my right and push down. It doesn't hurt if I am facing the front (looking at my raised leg) but it hurts when I turn to the side.

This has been a problem for about 5 years now, been to a doctor before and he did not think much of it since I am relatively flexible and still have the full range of motion. He just told me to stretch but that seems to be a short term solution. Anyone know whats wrong and if there is something I could do to get rid of the pain permanently?

"self inflicted burns, infection/safe to see medical pros?","throwaway acct due to self harm aspect

I ( 25F ) had a moment and gave myself some small 2nd degree burns using a lighter and silverware (real silver, tarnished) and everything was alright the two-ish days, but now theres extended swelling with deep tissue pain after I had to wear longsleeves for an overnight visit. So a lot of chafing, and where it was previously seeping its now crusted over and definitely has lint and whatever else in there.

I'm concerned first with if this is an infection I can control at home, or if I should go get some antibiotics before things get out of hand.

Second I've never had to show self harm wounds to medical pros before, I don't know if itll be safe, like even if I plead the 5th is this liable to get me inpatiented?

On the first day, I got so congested (nose, sinuses) that my ears started hurting and the outside sounds sounded like I am under water and my teeth started hurting too. That went away within a few days, but I cannot breathe through my nose at all. Went to a doctor, got antibiotics, didn't help. Went back for an X-ray of my face as the MD thought it could be a sinus infection, but nothing, no infection. There has been no pain in my sinus area, no fever either. Went to another doc, got other antibiotics, he did a hearing test too, my hearing was off in one ear and the antibiotics he prescribed also did not work.

I have tried an infra-lamp, and one of those facial steamers too in hopes of loosening up the congestion, a hot bath, but neither of them helped. Nose sprays don't help - not the OTC, not the prescription ones. Humidifiers don't help. Neti-pots don't help, the salty water won't come out of the other nostril.

I have used up most my vacation days and a lot of sick days, but I have to go to the office from time to time only to have to come back home because the air in the office is terrible and makes me even more congested and I just can't focus on work.

So I've been stressed out because of a new job i recently started which resulted in sleeping problems and two panic attacks so far. I've been to the doctor to talk about these problems and she prescribed me 15mg Mirtazapine to take before sleeping. Now I haven't told her that I'm trying CBD oil as i live in a country where cannabis is heavily stigmatized. I've been taking around 5 drops per day of 5% (per 1000mg) CBD oil which hasn't helped my sleeping issues so far. Is it safe to try the Mirtazapine tonight before sleeping if I already took the oil today? I've read that both medications are broken down by the same enzymes but now we're talking really low percentage of CBD.

Assymetry right-left side of my body.,"I would like to know if its common or know a condition where one side of ur body is kind of feminized with respect the other. In my case, the right side of my body has slightly less muscular mass on shoulders and arms (despiste being right handed), a bit bigger nipple size being also positioned lower than the left one , ""fallen"" right shoulder compared to the left one, and to finish, the more evident is that my right hipe waist bones are quite pronounced and feminine while the left one are not.

All this have been started since early puberty and Im 25 yo male . I would know what the causes could be and if theres anything to worry beside aesthetics. I must say that even if these effects are clear, if you look for them you wouldnt notice them unless you pay attention, besides for the hip-waist thing that is more notorious.

I've been having some shoulder pain the last 2-3 weeks.,"Hi all. A few (2-3) weeks ago I was doing dumbbell overhead presses at my gym. I've done the same weight (65lbs each hand) for weeks now and never had any issues. Well, after I completed the sets, I felt some pain in my right shoulder. Now, it feels sore whenever I try to reach behind my back to scratch it, or reach above my head. It doesn't hurt if I twist my right shoulder inward toward my body, nor if I hold it out perpendicular to my body. It doesn't even hurt when I sleep on my right side, BUT if I try to get up in the middle of the night via my right arm, it feels sore. I don't want to say it is painful, but if I try a push-up, I simply...can't. It just feels sore. 90% of the time during the day if I leave it alone it feels like nothing is bothering it.

I really hate this, and I didn't even think until this morning it could be a rotator cuff issue. I am not sure if it is or not, but the thought got me pretty nervous. I hate not being able to lift at the gym, I count on it to get the blood flowing every day after work. Part of me wants to hope it is just sore and ""will take time to heal"", but it's been already a couple weeks and I'm thinking it's a sprain or...I don't know. I just hope it doesn't mean surgery.

Please. If any doctor out there has any willingness to help me out, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you so much."

"[19M] [Cauc, 1.90m, 55kg] Daily syncope for 1yr, prev diagnosis of CMS","My son was diagnosed a few years ago with Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome, due to CHRNE gene mutation, none of the medications helped and were eventually discontinued.


About a year ago, after having a cold for about a week, he fainted, after which his face felt numb. What has followed has been a year of sometimes daily syncope, often with frontal headache, weakness, confusion, and difficulty forming sentences. The syncope can last from a few minutes to hours (he woke up on the floor once after two hours), sometimes with some dizziness and the headache occurring at onset, sometimes fainting with no warning, and realizing he has a headache as he comes out of it. Sometimes he only gets the headache. 
Initially he often experienced a tightness in his chest, possibly with palpitations, but he says he doesn’t get that anymore. He has recently been complaining more of pins and needles, feelings of numbness in his arms and legs after a syncope. 


He has had an onset while standing and sitting, progressed now to having them while lying down too, we think even in his sleep. He has had them after meals, but also at random times. 
He has had memory loss a few times, the longest being of the two and half days prior. Once he had a hallucination following an episode.


He has been hospitalized several times at two hospitals. He had CT scans, MRI, bloodwork, EEG, ECG, but no doctor has been able to find the cause. 
He feels unwell all the time, often with body aches, and has suffered several falls. He had to drop out of school and has been essentially housebound due to this and spends many a day in bed, especially when he has insomnia due to feeling awful.
He was prescribed Midone, which had no effect. He was briefly on Eltroxin due to low thyroid bloods, but discontinued after levels normalized. 
Cardiology then ruled out POTS after two halter monitors and Neurology has ruled out epilepsy after EEG/ECG/video monitoring.


He is almost 1.90m tall, with low muscle mass, and weighs about 55kg, despite typically eating well. He was put on supplement drinks for a few months in addition to normal diet, but he did not gain weight. 
I have recently put him on a ketogenic diet, but it has not improved symptoms so far. His appetite has been mostly normal, sometimes he will feel too unwell to eat. 


At the last appointment with the Neurologist, she has said that perhaps it’s some kind of migraine or related to the CMS, and there is nothing more she can do other than request advice from a myasthenia gravis specialist in another country.
We’ve heard nothing further from Neurology so far.


Any advice is appreciated, thank you!"
Can obese people on a diet and losing weight be malnourished?,"22/female/177cm/130kg (286lbs)/Hypertension, diabetes type 2, depression, anxiety, obesity/Metformin, atenolol, another blood pressure medication I forgot the name of, Saxenda injection and Lexapro/White/Australia 

Okay, I’m obese. I’ve lost 26kg (57lbs) since the end of June. Since August, I’ve been on Saxenda which assist with weight loss and decrease appetite. Since the middleish of August, I’ve also been eating approx. 700-900 calories a day. Occasionally less. I’m also low carb.

I’ve been tired, but not too bad. The last two weeks however, I’ve been ridiculously fatigued. I feel weak doing things like showering and chopping vegetables. I’ve also started having shortness of breath after basic tasks that didn’t give me shortness of breath before. I get v light headed when standing up, but that’s been happening for a while. 

Could this all be due to me not eating enough? Even though I’m obese? I eat a lot better now and don’t do sugar/fast food and mainly eat whole foods etc.

I can’t bring myself to eat more than this because I’m paranoid about gaining weight, and also not that hungry often. I see people do 800 calorie diets often so don’t think it’s too dangerous. I also started lexapro like 3 weeks ago as fluoxetine didn’t work, so could that be the cause too?

I tried googling and it says obese people can be malnourished if their diet sucks. But my diet is so much better than before, it’s just I’m eating less. are these normal lexapro side effects, or from not eating enough? Should I tell my doctor, or just wait it out? I don’t want them to be mad if it’s to do with eating. It also says a key symptom of malnourishment is losing weight without meaning too..I am losing a lot, but it’s on purpose? So idk. Or could it be anemia? Or just side effects from meds?

For the past few months since graduating, I have been trying to get a handle on my sleep since it was utterly fucked up during my college years.

I try to be regular, waking up between 0530 and 0600, drink 2 K-cups worth of coffee, biking to work, regular breakfast, etc. I currently tutor and do side jobs before I ship out with the Navy, so waking up early is not only alright, but necessary for when I actually go out to my real job.

I try to get to sleep around 10pm, but it doesn't always work out and my brain keeps me awake until maybe 11pm or sometimes 12am. I'm afraid to take sleeping pills because I don't want to be groggy in the morning, but on the other hand I get tired.

Yet on Sundays and weekends, especially during the day, I can just ""sleep through"" the whole day. I got back to my house on Sunday after staying over somewhere, passed out at around 2-3pm and slept until literally 12am... then stayed up for a few more hours and slept until 0600. Yet I still feel fatigued all the time, demotivated, like I need to sleep.

Why is this? I'm getting adequate sleep -- sometimes an hour less, but sometimes a nap in the afternoon and sometimes more, and still feel terrible. Its not like I'm going 8 hours of sleep to 2 hours and back; I'm being regular and I should be motivated and ripe to start the day."

I'm 22, female, and recently started bc pills per advice of my obgyn. My mom and my grandma both have varicose veins and heart problems, which is why I was reluctant to take combined pill at first. However, my doctor has advised me to get a coagulogram done, and its results were perfectly fine. My obgyn was pro combined pill as opposed to progesterone-only choice because I have slight skin issues and more male-like hair patterns that, according to her, may indicate increased testosterone levels.

I'm not a smoker (I can have a cigarette occasionally, but I'm determined to stop now that I'm on the pill), my BMI is normal. My doctor has advised me to get coagulogram done every six months to monitor the state of my blood. Is this going to help me make sure that there are no increased risks? Is there anything else I can do to keep myself updated? I understand that some things can happen out of the blue, but I would like to do everything in my power to avoid potential dangers."

Cephalexin for folliculitis no effect as of day 5,"Male 28 years old, non smoker, no regular medication, decent diet and healthy besides IBS-D

I've recently been prescribed Cephalexin 500mg 4 times a day for a particularly inflamed bout of folliculitis on my chin and front of neck.

I've always had pretty frustrating skin issues and have been prescribed doxy a few times and was on Roaccutane as a teen. For the past few years I've been able to keep it relatively under control using Salicylic acid, gentle cleansers and by getting to know ingredients lists pretty well.

My most recent outbreak is the worst I've had in years and follows me trying to incorporate hemp oil into my skincare routine. I've since read that the fatty acid composition of this may have actually caused a fungal outbreak rather than bacterial. If Cephalexin is having no effect (in fact, a couple of new pustules have appeared) after 4 days, is this more likely to be fungal? And would there be any adverse reaction to me using Ketoconazole topical whilst taking Cephalexin? My GP told me to take it for a full ten days if I don't see an improvement after 5.

TL:DR, prescribed cephalexin for folliculitis but no change after 4 days, wondering if this may be fungal and whether I can use Nizoral shampoo on the affected area at the same time

22M How to treat mouth herpes 3 days after outbreak,"Hello, last friday night I felt a slight burn on my upper lip, I understood that it was an outbreak that had just begun, I didn't pay much attention to it because I usually ride it out (I have an outbreak maybe once or twice a year).

The first day (Saturday) it was rather small and unnoticeable, just on the corner of my lip, so I thought to myself ""Nice, it wont be that bad!"" 

The day after that (Sunday) it had grown rather large and moved around the corner to my bottom lip with red irritation around my mouth area, that's when I got worried and got myself some vitamin B and Acyclovir to stop it from getting worse.

Today (Monday) it has calmed down a little, less irritation around the mouth, not as red and fierce looking aswell as skin is kind of starting to peel of.

However! I forgot I'm meeting my girlfriend for the first time in two months on Thursday and was wondering if the vitamins and Acyclovir helps post outbreak? I would want the sore to be gone by then. Everything I read online says that it mostly helps before the outbreak starts, my bad on my part... I know I should have gotten the medication already on Friday but didn't really think much of it...


So again, my general question is, does it really help if I eat Acyclovir and vitamins at this point?
Also, would it help if I got Abreva? I've heard it helps, but then again, I havent seen anyone complimenting it post outbreak.

I took 50mg of Tramadol and 300mg og paracetamol &amp; 500mg of ibuprofen

I also took a few sips of some 40% vodka. 

Reason why is not important, but it doesn't take a scientist to figure out that I'm not exactly having the best day of my life. 

Basically, I want to know when I'm going to fall unconscious (if I even took enough), as I have no intention of taking my own life, but if I took too much and fell asleep soon it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

Edit: 50mg, not 50g"
Badly bruised elbow with hematoma(?),"Male, 52, normal weight, fairly  fit and healthy.

I fell and banged my elbow badly about a month ago with extensive bruising and discoloration observed \~6 inches on either side of the impact.  It healed but continued to be very tender.  Banged it again really hard on the shower control knob and immediately noticed a large bubble at the site, perhaps 1-1/2"" x 2"" - much like a blood blister but deep under the skin.  It seems this might be called a hematoma.  I suspect I had something similar with the 1st occurrence but didn't notice, since I also had some road rash.  Pain & discomfort are minimal at this time though I can feel it when I bend my elbow

I've been keeping a compression sleeve on it but am wondering what else I can to speed recovery, also wondering if this is something for which I should see my doctor?

"I have phimosis, is it necessary to get circumcised?",I'm a 20 year old male and I can't pull back my foreskin so I decided to consult a urologist today and he advised me to get  circumcised.

What will happen if a doctor sees old self harm scars during an ultrasound 19F,"19F, 5’6”, white, 175 lbs, don’t smoke or drink

Bad wrist pain - no one knows why.,"I'll be trying to provide as much detail as I can. 

I've joined the army around a year ago. About a month and a half after enlisting, I've started having some wrist pain, especially when putting some weight on my wrist (push-ups, stretcher runs, long marches etc.). It gradually got worse to the state of it now, where I can't get out of bed using my hands - I ever make a fist to lift myself off of bad or I use my elbow/forearm, i obviously have stopped working out because every single exercise I liked is now impossible for me to perform, etc. Etc.

About the pain - there are 3 main locations on the wrist, all free of them are highlighted in the pictures ( https://imgur.com/a/56zs29V) . The pain is at its worse when I wake up, my entire wrist feels stiff as all hell and extremely painful. Can't even extend it to my already limited extension range. The stiffness and pain also gets worse in the evening hours, but not to the same degree. It gets worse when I flex my wrist up and down. 

Medical findings:

A small, dorsal ganglion cyst approx 0.6cm in my upper hand. This has been deemed to not be the cause of the pain (at least not to the level of pain I'm in) 

Ulnar Minus

Sometimes, my hand swells up and becomes in extreme pain in an area that the doctors call -""1st web space"" or something among those lines.

My right hand is much, much worse then my left hand, altho my left hand has been gradually worsening these past couple of weeks.

Tests conducted:

MRI - clear except ulnar minus and the 0.6cm cyst

Ultrasound - clear except 0.6cm cyst

Xray - same as ultrasound

EMG/NCVT - Clear

Blood tests and piss tests - normal


Not a single doctor I've been to has been able to figure out what I have. Im scheduled to an otroscopy thatll probably find nothing, and.. Honestly I just want this all to be behind me. I want to workout and do pushups again."
"Fainting, vision going black and hospital.","Female: 19 
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 83kg
Medications: none
Complaint: For a while now, I've had my vision start to go black. From time to time I had to lean on sth or sit on the floor due to complete vision loss but it wasn't something serious. From time to time I feel like the floor has disappeared underneath my feet and I get extremely dizzy. 
Last Saturday, in the evening, I passed out about 3 times. Each time I woke up I had my head or hand move, almost like it was twitching. I went to the emergency room and was left in the hospital until Tuesday (neurology). The only tests that were done were blood, x-ray and ultrasound.  Ultrasound was of the arteries in my neck and stomach area. X-ray was of my chest.
Everything came back negative, besides my blood test. Doctor said that my cholesterol levels are slightly higher than normal for my age and recommended for me to see an endocrinologists. My heart pressure was very low one morning and one of the results mentioned interventricular septum block on the right side.
While I was there, I was on alprazolam 0.25 mg and was once given one heart aspirin pill. 
Could the high cholesterol cause my blackouts or should I look more into it?"

Toe fusion to correct botched bunion and hammertoe surgery,"I'm 11 months out from a botched foot surgery in Glendale, California.  He claimed he ran out of time and the original surgeon didn't even show because he forgot.

I'm  a healthy, in shape 51 year old female.  I am still in a surgical shoe.  I can barely walk normal, swelling, constant pain, stiffness, arthritic, nerve issues, bunion still there, big toe curves in and goes under the fat hammertoe that sticks up.  It's been a nightmare to say the least and quite depressing.  

I have consulted with many doctors about a corrective surgery.  The last one was the first to mention the arthritis and his approach would be to fuse the big toe.  All the others were going to do the typical Chevron, Akin to correct it and pin down the hammertoe.  

I can't imagine having a life not being able to wear a heeled shoe or enjoy the activities I have always enjoyed in the past. 

Thoughts about this procedure? 

And, if you are a doctor responding, does this sound like this resulted in below the standard level of care? Would you have an outcome like that if you had performed it? 

Pretend I am your mother and don't judge me, but I am now seeing if I have any legal recourse.  It sucks how protected these crappy, pompous doctors can be.  I literally went in for something that is common and routine and came out so much worse. 

Now, I'm even considering not doing a second surgery and living with this hot mess.

Bad chiropractic adjustment?,"Last December, I went in for my first (and only) adjustment. I'm 36 (female) and healthy. I have many friends who see chiros on a regular basis and just thought I'd give it a try. I have a wonky neck and always have, so I told him no neck adjustments. Back adjustments were done and I came out of the room and started to feel woozy. I passed out on the floor and woke up to an ambulance on the way. Was released from the ER with nothing emergent. Came home and lied on the couch for a couple of days feeling out of sorts. Within days I was in a depressive state and have not come out of it. It was recommended to see a neurologist but because I am self pay, I have put it off. I'm exhausted of living like this and am going to get an appt. I went from confident, happy and driven to depressed, anxious and irritable in an incredibly short period of time. I'm worried I will be like this forever.

Sister ate too much salt?,"Sister is 14F.

Sorry, I know this sounds kind of dumb, but my fourteen-year-old sister mixed about 5 teaspoons of salt with water and drank it around 4 AM because she read somewhere that it’ll make her vomit. She wanted an excuse to miss school, because of a test. Now she’s complaining of a hurting/upset stomach, slight nausea/vertigo/shaky legs, etc. But what really worried me is fast breathing/heart rate, and aches below her chest. I don’t know if this is relevant, but she also has many minor mineral deficiencies and iron deficiency.

Should I be worried and tell my mom, or just let the symptoms pass? Again sorry that this is such a dumb situation."

Throbbing Pain above/behind right eye induces vomiting - symptoms before headache include right nasal constriction(always) sometimes visual distortion(like aura) - chronic case of migraine or supra orbital neuralgia?,"Hi, since childhood(first memory from 4th grade) I have been suffering from this situation where I develop constriction in right side of the nasal and (sometimes) I face visual distortion like light sensitivity or white spot (partial blindness) before I develop this throbbing/numbing pain behind or above my right eye. *Sleep seems to dissolve the pain* but that is if I am about to go to sleep (night time) otherwise it mostly results in vomiting and suffering for 4 to 5 hours. Current medication I take for the headache is **Tormax (Naproxen Sodium)**  which was prescribed by a Neurologist  


For checkups I saw  ENT professor, he prescribed **Alp(Alprazolam),** to be taken daily for stress release and diagnosed the whole thing to be *Supra Orbital Neuralgia* induced by stress. He asked me to take MRI brain scan (EP angle 1AM Gasserian area), the radiologist's report was okay. I then went to see ENT professor again he said the report was okay and prescribed Multivitamins and Alp(to be taken daily)  


This was after a big attack where I had suffered for hours and ended up in a really bad situation, had to be taken to emergency

For checkup, after another such episode, I then went to a neurologist, he diagnosed it to be a case of *Migraine* and prescribed me **Tormax(Naproxen Sodium),** told me not to take Alp(Alprazolam) as it is addictive and won't help much in my situation which I agree with as Alp didn't seem to help previously when symptoms had appeared or when headache started.  


Tormax(Naproxen Sodium) seems to help (not sure) but it is still very difficult a condition to deal with when the headache is about to start. It still, I am 30 years of age, feels like an unavoidable condition when the symptoms have appear. The only remedy and the most effective one is sleep. I do not have any big stress situation going on neither am I heart broken about anything. I am 9-5 jober and work at a private company and I think I am ok with this job (not anymore unhappy than anybody else)  


Please help/suggest remedy or any sort of steps to better handle this situation of mine. I will be really obliged"
My Wife Just Found Out She Is Pregnant (3 Weeks) and We’re A Little Nervous Because We’ve Been Drinking And Eating Lots of Sushi,"-	31 years old
-	Female
-	USA

My wife and I have one kid (2 years old) who was “spoiled” during her pregnancy. We were planning on the first pregnancy, so she was taking prenatal vitamins before she was pregnant, not drinking alcohol, and not eating any raw fish. 

We were on vacation last month (when the surprise conception occurred) and we had no idea it happened. She’s probably had two bottles of wine, three mimosas, and 9 raw oysters over the last week because we’ve had some wedding fun with friends and family.

Today, she was feeling cramps so she thought her period was coming...but decided to get a pregnancy test because I jokingly said she was probably pregnant.

BOOM! PREGNANT!

We’re super excited...but now we’re a little nervous because she hasn’t taken her prenatal vitamins and she’s been eating raw oysters and drinking alcohol since we had **no idea** she was pregnant!

She’s starting her prenatal vitamins tomorrow and not eating/drinking anything bad going forwards...but how concerned should we be that we harmed the baby?

Any insight or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit - To confirm. It’s been two weeks since conception (but 3.5 weeks from first day of her last period)...here’s what she’s had over the last two weeks...the last three items over the last few days.**

-	3 glasses of Prosecco
-	3 glasses of Wine

Can you be allergic to daikon radishes?,"  your age, approximate height & weight, gender, medications you take, smoking status, previous and current medical issues, duration and location of complaint 

Age: 22

Gender: F

Meds: Adderall,

Smoker: Just weed. Only on occasion (hate smoking, rather edibles)

Previous medical issues: Not much, I'm 22. Twisted my ankle once.

Current medical issues: ADHD, Possible allergy?

Duration: Bout an hour

Location: Tongue, Lips, Throat

 So, I sent my hubby out for parsnips so we could add them to the mashed potatoes for dinner, and he brought back a daikon radish by mistake.

I've never had it before, so I cut a sliver and we both tried it.

At first it tasted fine, then it got really spicy. It burned my tongue and made it numb in a way I've never experienced before. I was surprised, because I didn't know root veggies could be spicy. But I added just a little bit of it in with red potatoes, peppers, and carrots and boiled em ep.

I made the rest of the dinner, sat down, and bit into the potatoes. Although I had used very little radish to add a bit of spice, my entire tongue itched before going numb. My lips are still kind of itchy. Swallowing made my throat tight and itchy. I asked my husband if he thought the potatoes were too spicy, and he said they were perfect, and if anything really mild.

I gave him my potatoes.

Is it a simple UTI?,"Sex: female
Age: 30
Location: genitals
Began Saturday mid morning, seemed to resolve Saturday afternoon, began again Sunday afternoon.

My bf and I had sex Friday night. At one point his dick accidentally slipped into my anus (ouch! I don’t really like anal so that was not fun); he pulled out and I’m pretty sure he didn’t clean it well since within seconds he had reinserted into my vagina and we finished sexual intercourse. The feelings of UTI didn’t began right away. It wasn’t until Saturday mid morning when I started feeling that awful burning sensation while peeing. It went away by Saturday afternoon/evening. I drank a lot of water all day and had alcohol that night. Sunday comes, I’m feeling fine but realize I hadn’t really drank many fluids all day. Start drinking water in the afternoon/evening, still feeling good, have more sex with the bf, and go to bed. I woke up midnight-ish to pee and the awful burning is back plus a little bit of blood and very mildly cloudy urine. I made an appt to see my doc but won’t be able to go in until October 30th. Go figure. 

So, I’m 99% sure this is a UTI, but I’m wondering if maybe it could also be an irritated ureter/urethra from some mildly rough sex? I noticed during sex on Sunday there was some discomfort in my vagina/abdominal area, almost like a stiffness or heaviness. Any ideas, information, and input is welcome. Thank you."
"Questions about constitutional growth delay disorder (21 male, Caucasian)","I'm 99% sure I have it, firstly because when I was 8-10 they made an x-ray of my wrist, said something about bones not touching and told me I would start growing more later than others (they did this because I was short for my age). So I Google this and constitutional growth delay instantly comes up. 

Two years ago we looked at my blood in university and I had more cells of some type that kids have more of and also people who have a cold but I wasn't sick at the time. Also I get chest pains sometimes that get worse as I breathe in. That is something teens get too as I googled it.
And more recently I got swimmer's ear twice in each ear I think, (or maybe it didn't go away entirely) which is also common in teens.

So right now I barely have any facial hair. It grows fast though. I also notice new hairs every few weeks so I guess it's still developing. My father has really thick facial hair, he shaves it every day but it's still visible. 

I stopped growing in height, I'm still short but that's besides the point.

My voice is like a 14 year old kid's or something I can't even bear to listen to it. 

So my questions are how much longer until puberty stops? 25? 30? I feel like even for someone with my condition, it's still slow. 

Does this affect the brain as well? Is it less developed than normal? 

Is my voice stuck this way?"

I saw my gyno two days after and got a blood panel done, urine test, colposcopy, the whole nine and everything came back negative. I have post nasal drip, seasonal allergies and acid reflux that all have been going on for some time. There are raised areas behind my uvula that have been growing since July. They’re pretty big now. I went to my primary in July and he said “it doesn’t seem like anything to be concerned about” then a couple weeks later I went to a Little Clinic and the nurse said she “doesn’t see them” and now I have a virus/cold type deal and I went to the ER three days ago and the doctor said he doesn’t see them. Went to the ER last night because my temp got to 101.9, coughing so hard that I start to throw up and it’s all just mucus and all I’ve been able to do for days is sleep. My tonsils are swollen and rock hard. My tongue is white. The doctor at that ER said he definitely sees them and can’t miss them and said it might be coxsackievirus but then I told him I’ve had it for three months and he told me to see an ENT. The spots look like cobblestone throat or pharyngitis and doesn’t look like herpes or hpv. But if someone could help me out I really appreciate it!!

Any idea what could be going on, and if or when I will grow? 

Also, surely I’m not done growing although it may seem weird as my parents are short. Is there any chance I have somehow been on the receiving end of a tall gene from somewhere down the ancestors line ?

"My own OB won’t doesn’t want to examine me, she just tells me to NOT have sex because I am ‘young’","Hey guys, but I really need your thoughts/opinions on what I'm experiencing rn

So about 3 months ago, I got my wisdom tooth removed and was prescribed antibiotics. Fast forward for about a week later, i felt an extreme burning feeling /pain down there so I went to the doctor. She gave me medications (I took them though those weren't antifungals, she just gave me another set of antibiotics) the pain subsided and I thought I was okay after a couple of weeks so yes, i tried having sex. It was so bad that he couldn't even put the tip in. Anyways , I decided to move to another doctor as the first one didn't believed it was caused by antibiotics.

Upon moving to the second doctor, I told her my experience. She prescribed me a fluconazole to take for 9 days. She told me to just continue it for about 2-3 weeks. So a week after my medications were done, i thought I was already okay. I did try to have sex, but again, it felt so painful we couldn't even push it in. This sounds so embarrassing but I don't know who to ask on what to do, because my own doctor just told me ""to NOT have sex because you're still young"". That wasn't even my point. I can avoid having sex for as long as she wants but what if it still hurts the next time I try? I didn't need her judgement, i needed to know what was going on inside my body, and how I could properly heal. She didn't even want to examine me. Am I wrong? I don't know what to think anymore. It's so expensive in my place to even see a doctor.

In case you are wondering what my age is, I am 21 years old and me and my partner are clean and hygenic. He was the first one I have ever had sex with and it is the same for him. I don't want to self medicate but I am not seeing much improvements to the fluconazole the was prescribed to drink once every three days to me. Are there other ways that I could do that might help?"
Large patches of red dots on right arm,"18F, 5'4"", about 130 lb, Asian.
Soon after waking up today, I noticed lots of tiny freckle-like red dots on my right arm (there are none on my left arm or anywhere else on my body). I did not notice them yesterday, they seem to have appeared overnight. Here are pictures: https://imgur.com/a/AAzBIaY

I don't take any medications. I got a flu shot on Wednesday.

The spots are not raised, they do not hurt, and they only occasionally itch a little. I have keratosis pilaris, but these do not look anything like my keratosis pilaris bumps. From googling, they seem to be petechiae. I don't remember my arm getting any injury or pain recently. I carry a backpack every day, but the backpack straps go on my shoulders, not my elbow where most of the spots are. As a college student, I have been emotionally stressed and occasionally slept at odd times. Last night I stayed up until 3:30 am, but that was a one-time thing, I don't normally stay up that late.

According to the internet, it could be some serious conditions, but I haven't had any fever, joint pain, nosebleeds, or bruises. I feel normal aside from the red spots. However, the past few days I had a very small amount of vaginal spotting that was not part of my period. I've had spotting before, so it didn't surprise me much and I don't know if that's related to the issue at all. My right eye was bloodshot last week, although that went away with more sleep and hydration. Again, not sure if that's even related here.

I'll go to my college's health center, but I want to know what you all think."

Existing medical condition: he has sleep apnea so he uses CPAP, asthma

We’re on holiday when this happened (Last Friday night). We were throwing jokes at each other and laughing on the top of our lungs. He was sitting on the edge of the bed. Suddenly he coughed, his face turned red and he was grasping for air. At first I thought he was choking so I ran to get some water for him. The moment I left him, he collapsed onto the bed and I saw how his face turned red into purple. His left hand was shaking and some of his fingers were folder (pinky, ring and middle finger). I tried to press his chest and wiggle his arms, then I pulled him up. After a couple of seconds he gasps for air and he’s “awake”. He was pale after this incident and the very first thing he asked me was “what was that?”. I gave him some water but just a sip and let him sat down on the sofa for some minutes.  Before we went to bed, he complained that his left shoulder and back is painful. The next day up until today he seemed fine but I can hear him wheezing from time to time.

My last pap test was 2.5 yrs ago which came back normal, so I initially said no since I prefer to do it with my family doctor. The doctor seemed oddly pushy and annoyed that I didn't want to get the pap test that day (no idea why?) but obviously agreed to my wishes.

Then while he was swabbing me, he said my cervix looked ""very inflamed"" and he could see a small bump. He said I should get a pap test immediately. So we agreed but now I'm left scared and with so many questions..

* What are the possible causes of my cervix issues? Is it likely HPV and how quickly can HPV develop into cancer? 
* My boyfriend is a lot bigger than I'm used to so I would sometimes get sore during sex with him, not sure if that would have anything to do with the cervix inflammation?
* I live in western Canada, do pap test results usually take this long (4-6 weeks)? This seems alarmingly long to me, esp if I could have something serious.
*  This walk-in doctor told me I should still take the azithromycin he prescribed me even if the test results come back negative. Is this normal?"
Cavity on the roof of my mouth,"So I bought a pack of cigarettes after vaping for over a year and smoked a bunch of them. Now there is a long cavity on the roof of my mouth, as if I sliced it with a knife, and I'm afraid it might be infected or something.

Also my nose is a bit swollen and red, and I have developed a slight fever and sore throat.   
This issue being related to cigarettes is just a guess, but I gave them away to be safe. 

I am really hoping that this is no big deal and will heal itself. I could see a doctor but it's not very convenient where I live, and I was hoping some advice from the fine people at this subreddit.

 Area of concern: vision, neurological? 

I wear contact lenses to correct nearsighted vision, prescription between -3 and -4. 

I've noticed that occasionally the walls of my house seemed curved in a fishball kind of way. Closet doors, walls, doorways will all look like they have some kind of bulge or curve in it. It seems exaggerated when I'm tired or stressed. I had a vision test a few weeks ago but only really noticed it a lot since then. I raised my lense prescription recently, but my eye doctor said I could technically raise it even higher so I don't think the problem is that my prescription is too high. Is there a way to confirm that the problem is visual and not neurological? (concerned because of my significant neurological history) And anyone have a specific idea of what may be going on? Can I continue to ignore it or should I seek treatment?

"My ankle has painful ""cracks""","15M, for the past 2 weeks my left ankle has been acting weird. Some days it's 100% fine and others it feels kinda sore to move or rotate. The main problem is that sometimes in bed, if I move my foot in a certain direction (it changes but usually it's up to the right), I feel something comparable to cracking your knuckles, then a sharp pain that has progressively gotten worse. Afterwards a tendon or muscle down there feels sore for a bit, and if I repeat the motion shortly after I can feel something hit a bone then softly ""crack"" off without pain. Its strange as the last time I sprained my left ankle was 4 years ago, but I sprained my right ankle 3 months ago and it's fine. If you have any idea what it is, or some help on what to do it'd be appreciated."
Why do I get sharp pain in my jaw/cheek when I drink alcohol?,"I very rarely get this with other drinks but 99 percent of the time it's alcohol. After one can of beer or so after I've started to feel it a little bit the joints where my jaw bone attaches to my head will start to have a strong sharp pain emanate from it. It will be dull but sharp and consistent and then when I take a drink it will peak in sharpness and be almost overwhelming with how painful it is. The pain also sometimes travels up to my ears.

Hoping some of your comments can shock my mother into taking better care of herself. (52F),"
My mother:

5’2 
Pre existing conditions: Acid Reflux, High cholesterol 
Former smoker for 25 years quit 12 years ago 
Drinks rarely 
Family conditions: blocked arteries and cancers, heart attacks and strokes 


Today I overheard her on the phone saying she was diagnosed with high cholesterol and hasn’t gotten her medication yet which was prescribed to her a week ago. I’m so frustrated so I’m coming here to hopefully see if maybe reading some of the things said will shock her into a healthier lifestyle. 

My mom will not drink water to save her life, In my 23 years on this planet I have never seen her finish a bottle of water. She won’t eat vegetables unless it’s plain lettuce, she is a snack-cake-aholic, for a month straight all she would eat was hot dogs with FREAKING MAYONNAISE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. 

I’ve begged, and pleaded with her to change her diet, drink more water, and so on. When she asks me to grab her a drink I cut it with water. She only drinks tea, soda, and fake water like those nasty flavored colored waters and that is RARE. 

I just don’t get why she won’t do it and it’s really upsetting me why she won’t get over the “taste” of water because apparently it has such an unbearable taste she won’t drink it. 

I’m surprised her organs are similar in texture to beef jerky with all those diuretic drinks and high sodium foods she consumes. I’m so stressed out over it. I do most of the cooking and try new things to help get her to eat healthier but she’ll pick around the healthy stuff, or eat a whole pint of ice cream or an entire bag of chips for dinner instead. 



My moms main diet: 

Tea, soda, snack cakes, chips, cheez it’s, coffee basically only cream and sugar hold the coffee, chicken and rice with yum yum sauce, occasional pasta, from frozen chinese food, occasional red meat 



Can anyone comment what could be the consequences to her actions, or even the benefits of changing her ways.  I’m almost positive that a better diet and exercise would take away her acid reflux considering all she eats is fatty food or acidic drinks, and help improve her skin and weight too. 

Thanks so much in advanced for commenting, Im stressing out so badly over this."
"Feel like I have a heart problem, ER results come back clear","25M, 5'6, 146lbs, White Hispanic, tachycardia, 5 mo, no history of medical conditions, Escitalopram 5mg, socially drink (rarely), no smoking, nor recreational drug use.

Since the month of May I suffered a random outburst of tachycardia while I was calmly driving. My heart was beating at a constant 120 bpm. I was taken to the ER and had tests done. Blood work, EKG, chest x-ray, and a CT Scan. All ER results show nothing is wrong with my heart. They discharged me saying it was Anxiety reaction. I have no history of Anxiety but they gave me .5 mg of alprazolam. It only lasted a week and I felt no different taking the pill. All it did was worsen the insomnia once I ran out of those pills.

I started to suffer from constipation, sensitivity to cold, insomnia, and waking up exactly after 4 hours of sleep after the incident. Due to this I am also ALWAYS TIRED, even if I manage to magically get 8 hours of sleep. I have a constant sensation of someone poking my heart sometimes in the back or sometimes in the middle of my chest, feeling and aware of my pulse, sometimes feel my pulse strongly under my left armpit, sometimes sensation of heart about to give out and go into pain.

I was finally able to get an appointment with my primary to get a referral for a cardiologist. Primary prescribed me Escitalopram (5mg) for Depression and Anxiety but it changes nothing. Some of the side effects from the Escitalopram pill made me not want to take it.

This is the most aggravating part for me. I get the appointment to the cardiologist they do an EKG. They proceed to tell me they will do an Echocardiogram and a Holter. However, they expanded these tests in a span of 2 weeks. I will get the Echocardiogram done on 10/14, the Holter on 10/25, and the results on 10/30. My heart at times starts acting up and cause the sensation of my heart being poked to feel more present, have a faster heartbeat, and also get the sensation that my heart is about to go into pain. My fear is that the situation becomes worse as days keep going by. What feels like a heart issue to me doesn’t seem to be taken seriously.

I have never suffered from anxiety just to be clear. The only times that I get anxiety are from normal events like a speech in speech class or competitive scenarios to determine who the final winner is.

I hope someone understands this situation and can explain to me what is going on with me because I feel like I am dying and I am being consumed from the inside."
What are heart mumurs and are they dangerous?,"So the reason I don't want to Google this is simply because of all the false information I will find, leading me to believe they are what they're not.

How can you tell if you have them? I went to the doctors for something unrelated recently, they took my blood pressure and something else blood/heart related and everything was fine. I'm a 14 year old male, so is this something to be fearful about? Thanks for any help :)"
Had a panic attack a month ago and I've been having trouble breathing ever since.,"Race: 50% Indonesian 50% Caucasian
Sex: Male
Age: 17
Weight: 138lb / 62.6kg
Height: 5'8/172cm

I am not taking any medication and have no mental or health illnesses or any notable medical history whatsoever. 

A month ago I was almost hit by a car on the way to school, I was going to cross the road and a school bus stopped. In the USA, when a school bus stops, there's a stop sign attached to its side that pops out when it stops so anyone who's in the lane next to the bus has to stop as well. So I walked across the street, but a car did not stop with the bus, and almost hit me but I managed to walk fast enough just by chance for it to not have hit me. I did not see it coming at all due to the angle, a very close call.

I was a bit shocked, but whatever, went on as usual and didn't give it much thought at all. The next day, saturday, I was going to a local community college (I am in high school still) for a club meeting. I walked through the front door, and something just didn't feel right. That's it. I just felt a gut feeling that something was off, I felt a little bit restless. I didn't even know what was happening, I wasn't even thinking about the car incident the day before, that wasn't even on my mind at all- something just didn't feel right. Over the next hour the symptoms got worse, it was a panic attack. I became nauseous, began to throw up, hyperventilated, and I legitimately thought I was going to die as I didn't know it was a panic attack at first. Had to call my mother to pick me up and bring me home while I was losing my mind.

It settled down after an hour and I was pretty spent from the adrenaline. Now here's where the issue starts, a bit after that day, my breathing became ... difficult. See, I'm an athlete, and I regularly lift weights and do cardio so I know how my lungs feel and this isn't right at all. **Only half the times I breath in can I get a full breath in.** It's not enough to cause any pain, but it's very uncomfortable. I've continued weightlifting and running and such and it's not an issues, but it is very uncomfortable.  I know something just isn't right with my lungs and I know the panic attack triggered it. Only half the times I breath in can I get a full breath in, well, all the times I breath in a get a full breath... but it's not **satisfying**. Like it filled up but it didn't scratch that itch to get a breath in. I've been going through a month of this and it's not life threatening I'm sure but It just makes breathing very annoying and sometimes difficult since I'll have to keep focusing on my breathing to catch a satisfying breath, and even then, only half the times I breath in will it actually feel like I ""completed"" the breath.

I got an x-ray scan (not sure if it's an xray but some sort of scan) for my chest and lungs where I had to breath in and they would take a picture of it. Every time I breathed in it didn't feel right or satisfying during that test. A few days later my mother tells me that they found nothing abnormal with my lungs.

This has led me to believe either my problem needs a further diagnosis and scanning of sorts to find the issue, if it is physical that is. However, the other possibility that I think is most realistic is that the panic attack messed with my mind and subconscious. I will begin meditating and see if that helps, but I'm pretty worried as my racing season is coming up soon and I'll be pushing my body to its limits and I don't want this issue with my breathing to complicate anything."
How likely are you to develop motion sickness as an adult?,"I'm a 24 year old male with pretty severe anxiety at the moment and one of my big anxieties is fear of throwing up or being otherwise severely unwell. I live most my life nauseous at the moment as a direct result and I fear going on drives or playing video games due to the fact they may give me motion sickness (I've never suffered from it before even as a kid). I was just wondering, what are the odds I'd just kinda... Develop it all of a sudden? Is this just anxiety? Also is it possible to become motion sick by something you've already done in the past with no issue? For example playing a game you played a year ago with no issue?"
Is this just flu?,"So the past 3 days Ive had what Id consider flu like symptoms, sneezing, coughing, runny nose and tiredness. But yesterday and last night was horrible. I’ve started to struggle breathing and It’s making a wheezy noise when I breath in. I feel like I have to take these deep wheezy breaths or I wont get enough air. This lead to me last night just not being able to sleep. I stayed up not because I wanted to. But because I felt like my body made me. I was in a bit of pain in the stomach every now and then and Ive completely lost my appetite. I’m trying to force myself to eat but god is awful. I feel weak all of the time. Like frail old man and I’m only 19 lol. Any suggestions to what it might be or if it is just flu would be appreciated. Thanks"

Hi, ive been on nexplanon since Feburary. since then ive been having nonstop periods. it stopped for awhile, maybe late july, til late august. i’ve been having dark brown slightly heavy bleeding since late august. I just now really started noticing me getting dizzy at random times and feeling shortness of breath. I looked it up and it says i may be anemic, but Im also thinking could this just be part of my Nexplanon side effects? 

Dont know if this is apart of anemia/being anemic but I also at times feel like i cant feel my heart beating. when i have others feel my chest they say it feels fine but other than that I still feel like its the end and I might die. 

I texted my grandpa that I may need to go to the hospital to get it checked out asap, but until then can I have a peace of mind that I wont die or anything. im having an extreme panic attack thinking im going to die or something.


also im sorry im on mobile and its 4am, and im currently like i said, panicking lol."
How likely am I to get infected by flesh eating bacteria?,"I went kayaking in the Potomac River (by Georgetown) on Saturday. Once I got out I realized I had an abrasion on my pinky finger and it was bleeding. The wound is smaller than the the circumference of a pencil; I don't remember how I got it, but I must've bumped it against my kayak while rowing. I went back home about an hour later and washed it thoroughly with soap and dabbed it with some rubbing alcohol. Today, more than 24 hours later a scab has formed and is somewhat yellow, and the surrounding skin is slightly pink and a little swollen. I felt a bit feverish (could not verify because I don't have a thermometer), but I'm chalking that up to the sudden drop in temperature recently. 

I've been reading a lot of articles regarding vibrio and necrotizing fasciitis; I know it's worse for people with compromised immune systems, but I'm kinda freaking out about losing a finger or worse. Should I be concerned, or am I just being paranoid?

Current medications: tums, pepto bismol, miralax

for a few years now it's always been a little hard for me to poop. My stole could be soft, watery, or hard and it will all be the same, just a little hard to pass, but will always pass when I try to go. I just accepted it as normal and never saw a doctor.

But a few days ago I started to have stomic pains and thought I ate something bad, but it's been going on non stop. If I feel my stomic acting up, I need to try to pass gas or poop. If I dont, ill be in pain. When I try to poop nothing will come out. When I lay down at night to sleep my stomic will flair up in pain and I have to try and go poop. The pain is so bad it'll wake me from my sleep. But nothing will come out. And if it does its only a little poo or a lot of gas. 

Now ive noticed when I wipe it looks like a brownish red or maybe a little more red then brown. I'm color blind, but I can tell there's red mixed in there

I dont know what to do. I took tums when this first started happening, then the next day I took pepto bismol cuz the pain was still there and I also felt nauseous, after this I realized it was more in my intestines then stomic and I tried miralax to help me pass whatever thats trying to come out.

I havent seen a doctor in years and I'm scared to go cuz I can't afford to pay for what ever they might find. I have medical insurance but it only kicks in after ive spent 5 grand and I think my copay is a few hundred dollars after that. 

I've kinda suspected I've had anal fissures for the past few years since its been so hard for me to poo. I also can never get a fully clean wipe even after I wipe until the paper is clean: I'll have skid marks a few hours after pooping, it's like the poop is trap deeper inside. To be fully clean, I have to stick the paper into my butt hole and clean the inside of my butt. It's been like this for a few years.

Out of 10, the pain is like a 4 or 5 when it flairs up, but it could go up to a sharp 7 when it's bad. My guess is I might have ruptured something. When I try and poo, I push but I never push too hard.

Edit: Idk if this matter but ive never stuck anything up my butt. Just maybe half a finger length with wet wipes to clean my butt hole, but other then that, no kinky stuff."

However being the hypochondriac I am, I felt around my chest and ribs and on my rips I feel small bumps and some sort of mass (Don't know how to describe it) around my right rib that kind of goes onto my sternum. Are these just fatty lumps like Lipomas or should I be concerned? When should I start to worry or see somebody? I was going to go to the Walk-In clinic if it bothered me more."
"[25M] Mixed cannabis and alcohol. Passed out, fell, worried about concussion","Yesterday, I drank a few beers (3 Bud Light Platinum) and smoked some cannabis from a pen, maybe 5 hits or so. Individually, this is well within my limits, but I've never mixed the two. I went to go to sleep.

Anyway, I had to use the bathroom, so I stood up and walked over. While I was standing over the toilet, my vision started to black out. I think I fell to the ground.

I don't remember anything from this point on besides rolling around on the floor for a bit, and then standing up. I couldn't have been blacked out for more than a few seconds (I think, no way of really being certain).

I know I must have hit my shoulder pretty hard during the fall, because it's bruised and my shower door was popped out of the seal- which requires a non-trivial amount of force. I'm assuming I must have slammed my shoulder against the shower door.

My head doesn't have any bruising or spots that are tender to the touch, so I'm not sure if my head hit anything.

Anyway, after this, I stood up and went back to my bed and slept.

The next morning (today), I woke up and had a slight headache that persisted throughout the day. There might be loss of balance, but I can't really tell. I've held conversations just fine. There's ringing in my ears, but I'm 99% sure it's just my regular old tinnitus. The headache is the only definite, and it's lasted pretty much all day.

So, I'm worried about two things:

1. Why did I pass out? I'm not a regular cannabis user, but I've never passed out from cannabis use before. This was my first time using cannabis and alcohol simultaneously, though.

2. Could I be concussed? The headache is definitely there, but I don't think I hit my head. There's no tender spot on my head at all, no bruising, nothing. I don't think the requisite forces were at play. I don't have any other symptoms besides a slight headache.

I do have a history of passing out, maybe 4 or 5 times in my life. Each of these incidents happened when I had either not eaten or drank in a while. This is the only time I've passed out while I was alone, or under the influence.

Thank you. Appreciate any insight or advice."

Struggling to find a diagnosis - is this pheochromocytoma lab incorrect?,"36 years old

Female

Caucasian

5'5"" 200 lbs

ongoing issue: tachycardia (200+bpm spikes, elevated 120+ at rest for hours, 3 episodes in 2 months) faintness, blood pressure spikes during episode but has been fine otherwise when checked - extreme fatigue for days after an episode -  headaches for 5+ months on a regular basis, near daily strongly felt PVCs and erratic resting heart rate for 2 months, so far controlled by new medication - echocardiogram and ECG stress test normal

existing diagnoses: small subserosal uterine fibroid found a year ago, CT scan with oral contrast in January confirmed fibroid and showed nothing else of note

medications: 25mg atenolol once per day started 1 month ago to try to prevent elevated heart rate episodes - has worked so far though I had some PVCs on 2 short occasions just before due to take next dose

do not smoke, drank 2-4 glasses of wine per week prior to onset, but not since headaches started 5 months ago, previously also 5mg THC edibles 3 times a day, also stopped about 2 months ago after tachycardia episodes started

Current issue:  
Recently I did 2 consecutive 24 hours urine tests so my doctors could check/rule out pheochromocytoma.  When I got the lab results I immediately noticed something off (see attached image). It states my metanephrines/normetanephrines are high, however it also states that the total volume was 3550 ML.  One 24 hour jug was about 2000ml, the other 24 hour jug was the remainder of the total of 3550.   My normetanephrines on the results state 172 ug/L and 611ug/24 hours.  I am not a doctor but I am good at math and this makes no sense to me.  It was 2 jugs that I submitted which should have been tested separately AFAIK since one had a preservative, and one did not.   Even if they were tested together, if they are stating 611 ug per 24 hours, and 172 ug per liter... 172 ug X 3.55L = 611 ug... but the 24 hour measurement should have been less than the full 3.55 liters - 3.55 liters is the total over **48 hours**.    It seems to me the 611 number is incorrect along with the rest of the numbers because they are all using the 3.55 for 24 hours.

They are now having me redo the metanephrines test because it was only ""slightly high"" but also want to do a CT scan with and without contrast.  If in fact my metanephrines were about half of what was stated I would have been in the normal range and I am concerned I am going to spend 1-2 thousand $ on more tests for a mistake!  I am aware my symptoms can be that of a pheochromocytoma, however, it could also be something more common like SVT.  Am I wrong that this lab report is incorrect?  
Also if they suspect I may have a pheo at this point, why are they leaving me on the atenolol? It’s my understanding that without me also taking an alpha blocker this could cause a hypertensive crisis next time the pheo goes active if it is indeed what is causing the episodes I’ve experienced.

Any advice about yeast infection?," So about 3 months ago, I got my wisdom tooth removed and was prescribed antibiotics. Fast forward for about a week later, i felt an extreme burning feeling /pain down there so I went to the doctor. She gave me medications (I took them though those weren't antifungals, she just gave me another set of antibiotics) the pain subsided and I thought I was okay after a couple of weeks so yes, i tried having sex. It was so bad that he couldn't even put the tip in. Anyways , I decided to move to another doctor as the first one didn't believed it was caused by antibiotics.

Upon moving to the second doctor, I told her my experience. She prescribed me a fluconazole to take for 9 days. She told me to just continue it for about 2-3 weeks. So a week after my medications were done, i thought I was already okay. I did try to have sex, but again, it felt so painful we couldn't even push it in. This sounds so embarrassing but I don't know who to ask on what to do, because my own doctor just told me ""to NOT have sex because you're still young"". That wasn't even my point. I can avoid having sex for as long as she wants but what if it still hurts the next time I try? I didn't need her judgement, i needed to know what was going on inside my body, and how I could properly heal. She didn't even want to examine me. Am I wrong? I don't know what to think anymore. It's so expensive in my place to even see a doctor.

In case you are wondering what my age is, I am 21 years old and me and my partner are clean and hygenic. He was the first one I have ever had sex with and it is the same for him. I don't want to self medicate but I am not seeing much improvements to the fluconazole the was prescribed to drink once every three days to me. Are there other ways that I could do that might help?"
Is This Cause For Concern? [Mental Health],"Prefacing this with this is an alternate account, and I don't visit Reddit often to begin with, so please forgive me if I make any mistakes typical of someone who doesn't know what they're doing on this site.

I'm 21F in the United States, diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I believe, the second type?), ADHD, general anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder (even though I thought you can't have that and bipolar), and high-functioning aspergers (or as now known, ASD). My doctors have said something about seasonal affective disorder, but nothing I have on paperwork to prove it, but I do have the behavior pattern. I was previously on medicine (different types, cycling through a lot and going through genetic testing as well because I've been on so much...) since I was probably 4 or 6 years old. I've been off of everything since maybe April of this year. The people in my life (family \[I still live with my parents\] and social workers \[job coach, psychiatrist\] and my boyfriend of almost a year \[known him for 6 years now\]) have all said I seem to be in much more control over myself without the medicine. At first, it was a weird ride for control over myself and my actions without the medicine, but then, after the first month, it became so much better. I've gotten to a stable point in my job where I could get promoted, I'm starting on looking for apartments to move out with my boyfriend, and I've gotten over my shopping addiction. The people in my life tell me I've matured, especially in these 6 months. This is great and all, until we get to around now.

I'm starting to experience much more paranoid/anxiety-driven thoughts in the past few months, specifically past few weeks. I don't have many real life friends, and I primarily communicate online. My main source of community right now is a Minecraft community, but I previously played an MMO for about 3 years that really excited my paranoia and perpetuated it because everyone in the community was manipulative and everything was essentially ""a game of 4D chess"", so any friends you thought you made, you didn't, and everyone had an ulterior motive, etc. So most of my online interactions leave me anxious and concerned off-and-on. I'm starting to become concerned with my computer specifically, the solace of my existence. I keep feeling like someone's watching my computer activity with no dissernable proof other than my previous experience as a hacker, where I was able to essentially watch someone for hours on end for no reason other than because I could, without them knowing a thing. All the recent memes with the punchline of ""the face of the FBI agent watching my computer"" also have kind of been festering in my mind.

I don't want to get off my computer: it's my main source of social activity. I live in the middle of nowhere and no one has similar likes to me. Most of my hobbies revolve around gaming, or otherwise I can't seem to keep an interest in them long enough for me to develop something around it. I also have some physical issues and fears that prevent me from wanting to try physical-based activities, so ""just getting off the computer"" is not really an option. I guess what I'm trying to say is should the help I be looking for be solely therapy, or should I go back to anxiety medication? Or would this be a sign of something worse than anxiety developing (i.e. psychosis)? I'm really scared of ending up basically in a state where I don't realize how far off I am, and everyone around me is just playing along with it or I'm ""not present"" enough to understand. I've had concerns in the past regarding these things that are now becoming more prevalent fears (i.e. in the past, I've been concerned about the informational backdoor on my computer, but it hasn't gotten me to the point where I'm uncomfortable doing things on my computer or it festers in my mind while I'm doing things that someone could be watching me and/or laughing at me for doing it).

Thanks in advanced, and I'm sorry if this came out as a word salad.

chest pains + chd,"20F, 5foot2, 160lbs, oral bc
I have a chd, PAPVC, with shunting and a heart block, and have been asymptomatic my whole life. The past few weeks I’ve been feeling a constant pressure in my chest, like someone’s standing on me and I can’t breath. And I have these “episodes” that involve pain in my chest, dizziness, nausea, racing heart, blurry vision, and difficulty breathing. My resting bpm has also been very high, I’m usually 60-70 bpm but it hasn’t gone under 100 since all of this has been happening. I’ve been in the emerg 3 days in a row and saw my cardiologist, but they have no answers. Waiting to be put on a Holter monitor but in the mean time does anyone have any thoughts as to what this might be?"
"Drug-induced lupus caused by Lamictal, or a triggered flare?","I’m 25, female, white, NY, 5’2”, 158lb, never smoker. Take Lamictal 100mg and modafinil 100mg as needed. I’m bipolar type 2, have migraines.

My blood work has come back: positive ANA 1:160, homogenous, positive AHA 2.8, all other ENA negative. My ESR is 30, WBC 3.5, I have macrocytosis, normal metabolic panel. 

I took Lamictal for two weeks and had: lymphadenopathy, fever, myalgia, photosensitive rash, oral ulcers, weight loss (fifteen pounds to date), diarrhea, pompholyx. The symptoms persisted for about two weeks and have settled into just a rash on my forearms and hands that turns red in sun or fluorescent light. 

Before this I’ve had other issues: my hair has stopped growing and falls out; I’ve lost at least 50% of volume, and I have had transient rashes over the past two years. My hands began swelling last year until I had to resize my engagement ring. I see a cardiologist for chest pain and very persistent tachycardia. 

I have taken quite a few psychiatric drugs over the years to control my mood symptoms with limited success. Effexor worked well but caused intolerable sweating and worsened my heart palpitations. I’ve stopped everything, including birth control, back in July. Now I take the Lamictal and the modafinil when I work. The Lamictal works very well with no other side effects, unlike lithium, which gave me tremors and destroyed my creativity (which to me is an intolerable side effect).

I’m waiting to see the rheumatologist but I really have no intention on stopping the Lamictal. Risking permanent movement problems with an antipsychotic or kidney failure with lithium is just as bad as an autoimmune response. I’m absolutely not going back to SSRIs and weight gain and not risking an even worse response from trying Depakote or another anticonvulsant. 

I’m very frustrated. I’ve read this kind of reaction is exceedingly rare (caused by Lamictal it has happened only a handful of times after several months or years) and it has quieted down. Does this seem to be DILE or a flare from the drug? Are there any other mood stabilizers I’m unaware of besides lithium and anticonvulsants? Again, I’m extremely hesitant to take an antipsychotic and risk weight gain and TD."
17M- Low libido and increased tiredness after starting Prozac and other meds,"So first off I’ll list my meds: I’m on Prozac, Lamictal (for bipolar reasons not seizures,) Corlanor, Straterra, and Mestinon, In other words quite a lot. I’ve started having decreased libido as of the past year or so that I’ve been on these medications, but I don’t think it’s the Mestinon, Corlanor, or Strattera since the symptoms predate those. I thought “It’s just your hormones balancing out after puberty.” However I think that quick and that much of a drop is inordinate and it worries me of my long term health if the problem is not addressed. Of course Advil is not an option even despite of my dysautonomia because of the health concerns with that. I don’t want to cut back on Prozac because it does help me a bit, how can I treat this? What could be the cause?"
Knees.,"Gender : male.

[F/24] Possible causes for my knee throbbing and pain? I had a surgery to remove an osteochondroma about 8 years ago.,"[F/24/150lbs/5'4/brazilian/mixed race but probably mostly white] So sorry for my bad English. When I was a teenager I had knee surgery to remove a benign tumor. It was large enough for people to ask me why I had two knees in one same leg. My knee did not hurt while I had the tumor, neither did it hurt after I recovered from the surgery. Recently, the same knee I had surgery started to hurt, mostly at night, after I walked around one day more than normal at college. Past almost 3 weeks, it still hurts and sometimes pulsate, burns, and it is uncomfortable, as If I'm carrying a weight on my knee when I walk for more than 10 minutes. I'm sedentary. It looked slightly swollen too.

I don't remember any recent accidents with it, but sometimes I bump my legs on corners of things. I'm very clumsy. My bones recently in a lot of parts of my body have been making creaking sounds too. I did not have it before. 

As medical history: I don't drink and don't smoke. I don't take any medications or drugs. I try to keep a health diet, limiting carbs as much as I can, but I can't resist my rice and beans or sweets when I'm feeling sad/anxious! Before my knee started hurting, I was already experiencing ocasionally numbness of my fingers on hands and also my toes, extreme fatigue, and my vision goes dark almost every time I stand up. I also have constantly headaches with nausea. One day at night, I had so much dizzyness for hours, that I had to wake up my mom because I thought I was going to die, but it passed without me needing to go doc. My ears clog constantly too.

I don't have diabetes (tested twice recently) my CBC is normal too. But my ferritin and prolactin are slightly out of range, and I had hepatites A when kid. Lipidic painel normal, except the HDL which is lower than what is supposed to be, around 30, when it should be above 50. My vitamin D has been bellow 30 for about 2 years now, even after taking supplement. Thyroid normal. I went do endocrinologist because I have acne, but she did not come to any conclusion other than I'm an anxious person. I have some problems holding my pee since some 4 years ago too, having leakages every day, but I never talked to any doctor about it, because it seems shameful. I was never pregnant either.

I'm scared I might have some nerve damage from the surgery or somewhere else in my body or, worse, a blood clot. I even had trouble breathing today when I tried sleep on my belly, I had to go out of my room to a more open place, because was hard to breath. I already went doctor and schelude MRI and x-ray of my knee. The doctor didn't talk much about what It could had been. I also didn't tell much of my symtoms, just that my knee was hurting. I'm just anxious about the diagnoses and wonder what it could be. Anyone has an opinion? Thanks very much for reading. I will post an update here once I discover what is wrong with me, for educational purposes, in case someone curious."

Soreness/Pain in/around both eyes. Please advise.,"I have been dealing with pretty bad ***eye pain/soreness for about 1 month*** now in ***both eyes***. The pain had a very ***sudden onset*** as I first noticed it on the bus home from work one day (I am a research fellow - yes, ***I work with mice***). The ***pain feels like it is localized more to the tissues around the eye***, and I have pain occasionally when I move my eyes as well. 

***I went to see an eye doctor for these symptoms*** last week but the ***findings were unremarkable***. Great visual acuity, normal orbital pressure, retina intact, no immune infiltration into eyeball, optic nerve head looks perfectly healthy, no apparent corneal or scleral issues, no apparent foreign bodies.

Given the unremarkable findings, I was hoping that the symptoms would go away on their own, but I am beginning to think that the problem is with one or more tissues around my eye and not the eyeball itself given the pain sensation. Motrin provides some relief but I would rather not be taking that stuff multiple times a day everyday as a band-aid to an underlying problem. ***Would GREATLY appreciate any advice as to potential conditions or things to discuss with my doctor.***

Conditions: complex migraine, GERD, benign PVCs
Medications: Sumatriptan, Ranitidine
Allergies: none

Looking for another perspective on a lifelong issue. I have had muscle pains my whole life that I have always described as “growing pains” because that is what I was told they were as a child. These pains are deep, crampy, aching pains and occur in many parts of my body, primarily in my knee/thigh, shoulders, elbows, and buttocks. They can make the affected limb painful to move. Never more than one spot at a time. I also get sharp “pinching” pains in my toes and fingers, often just one finger or toe. No swelling or redness The pains typically last about an hour, but sometimes last up to 24 hours. They resolve suddenly. They are often worse at night. They can be painful enough to prevent me from sleeping. 

At age 17, my pediatrician suggested that this could be caused by a genetic hyper mobility syndrome but said that there was nothing to be done about such a condition and told me to just keep an eye on my heart. I am hyper mobile but don’t have subluxations or dislocations.

At age 22, I developed persistent PVCs and saw a cardiologist, relaying that my pediatrician had said I could develop heart problems as a result of the hyper mobility syndrome. My cardiologist disagreed and didn’t believe I had any type of connective tissue disorder. My heart was fine.

I have had basic lab work many times for this muscle pain. I usually have a borderline high C reactive protein, but it is never high enough to warrant further tasting. Aaa a

Prednisone test for RA?,"47 year old Caucasian female, 5’ 5”, 240 lbs. clinically obese. HBP well controlled with medication. No smoking or drugs, two alcoholics drink per month. 

For the past few years I have suffered joint pain, especially in my feet and knees. It comes and goes- some days I feel like I can hardly walk, other days I’m fine. I always feel crappy to some degree. I always assumed it was weight related- and I am aware that losing weight would help, regardless of what is causing the pain.

I also have a history of asthma. I recently had a bad cold and my asthma was bad enough to require Prednisone. I took 20 mg TID for six days. It didn’t do much for my breathing but my joints felt amazing. It’s been years since I felt that good- I felt like I could run a marathon. I hated to see the Rx run out, honestly.

My question is: would prednisone have that effect on OA pain, or pain from overweight? I am not trying to find an excuse to stay fat, but my lack of mobility is not helping my weight loss progress. Is it worth discussing this with my doc? Or will she roll her eyes and tell me to get more exercise?"
"Molluscum Contagiosum? (Toddler, Male)","19 months, male, skin lesion on ankle lasting 13 months 

My son developed what looked like a small wart on his ankle when he was about 6 months old. I showed it to his pediatrician and she said it was a ""harmless papule"" and was best left alone unless it caused issues with wearing shoes later. They started popping up in other places (lower back, arms) so I consulted Google for a second opinion and determined it was likely Molluscum Contagiosum. None of them ever seemed to bother him so I left it alone. They were dormant for 11 months.

Over the past 2ish months the one on his ankle slowly got bigger and developed a more pronounced indentation, and week ago it started to get red and apparently itchy, because he's been picking at it (whereas before he didn't seem to realize it was even there). All of a sudden it looks like this (http://imgur.com/a/NwkHyDo) - it's not hot at all, it hasn't leaked anything, and he doesn't have any reaction when I prod at it. I've read that the bumps do get inflamed when the immune system starts working on them, but none of the images on Google look quite as angry. 

Is this part of the normal MC progression, or is it time for a doctor? He HATES going (he knows he gets shots there) so I'd like to spare him the trauma if it doesn't need treatment.

Is the d dimer necessary in my case? (22F),"For the last three weeks, I've been having mild reproducible chest pains (basically along my sternum and where the costochondral junction is) and some infrequent abdominal pain, a cough (I also had a cold though), fast heart rate on exertion, and mild shortness of breath (I had some a few days before the other symptoms, but no noticeable recent episodes). An ECG ruled out anything heart related and blood tests for anemia and hyperthyroidism were negative. However, the doctor decided I didn't need the d dimer because of my low risk on the Wells scale (the only possible things I could have on there are that I sit around on my computer a lot but they said that's not the same as immobility and I had some tenderness on the deep veins in my calf when it was palpated but haven't felt pain there otherwise) so they decided not to give me it. They said the risks of it being a false positive (cost and radiation from testing) are higher than the risk of it actually detecting a pulmonary embolism. Is the d dimer worth worrying about? They said to go to the ER if my chest pain gets really bad or constant or if I have really bad shortness of breath, but they're thinking it's costochondritis and that I should just take pain medicine for a bit and wait for the remnants of my cold to go away."
I (22F) am always falling asleep,"I’m a 22 year old graduate student, and as long as I can remember I’ve been sleepy.

This trend has continued up into my 20s and is now effecting my life more dramatically.
As a grad student, I do tend to stress myself out, and maybe drink more than I should, but I eat a healthy diet and exercise 4 days a week, and do everything I can do be as healthy as possible. I limit my caffeine consumption to only the mornings, and usually get about 6-7 hours of sleep a night.
At this point, I find myself falling asleep during any free time I have, and missing out on a lot. It’s becoming intrusive and I don’t know what else I can do to try and stay awake"

Hi there I'm I have been having tonsil problems for like the past month. First it was constant sore throats but it would stop and then come back.  The pain wasnt horrible. Now my right tonsil is rock hard and very large. It doesn't hurt to swallow or anything. I'm just wondering what's up."
Should I have my gall bladder out?,"31 yo female, 130 pounds. No health problems. Went to ER a month ago due to severe midsternal pain, excess bloating, and severe nausea that didn’t go away with tums or pepto. They tried GI cocktail with no relief of symptoms. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. They gave me toradol and it helped. I was told to follow up with a surgeon. These symptoms have occurred 3-4 times since I went to the ER. 

The surgeon recommended a HIDA scan, which came back with a normal ejection fraction of 59%, but the CCK recreated similar pain and nausea. He recommends gall bladder removal. 

The surgeon offered to refer me to GI if I wanted to wait, but I’m sick of feeling this pain and nausea.

My fear is the after effects of having it removed. I am usually regular with one BM every morning. Since this has started, I get bouts of watery diarrhea and cramping sometimes after fatty meals. Is it worth getting my gall bladder out?"
36M excessive gas & reflux,"Throwaway, because this is kind of embarrassing. 

I don’t always have what I would consider excessive gas, but I do think I pass gas more often than most. Lately, like the last week or so, I probably have to fart every 3-5 minutes. Stool has been fairly normal. Maybe slightly on the loose side. I’m not in any discomfort. No apparent bloating or anything. 

Also, after eating, I almost always get the sensation of needing to clear my throat. This feeling probably lasts 10-15 minutes after eating and happens almost every time I eat a meal. Maybe worse after dinner? No real pain or discomfort though. This has been going on for a while now. Probably months. 

I can’t seem to trace any of my symptoms to a particular food. I eat healthier than your avg American. Limit sugar and fast food, but probably eat more protein than necessary. I’m 6’0 and 155 lbs. 

Any ideas? Thanks for your advice!"

I have built up an inflammation inside my right ear probably by using a Q-tip/ear picker and most likely scratching against my right ear's ear canal on the lower side.

18M - random trouble urinating (almost impossible) in my own restroom,"So I've had issues of sorts with urination for the past 3-4 years; typically if I'm in a public restroom I will tend to have an extreme difficulty urinating, regardless if I'm in a stall standing or sitting. For a great while up until just recently this difficulty was only present in those scenarios where I was in public and around people who I were not familiar with. At that point in time I believed it was a psychological issue and it probably was, however recently I've started having episodes where I will experience that same extreme difficulty urinating except it occurs from within the comfort of my own bathroom. Now I did go see my physician when this first began a few months ago and he said that it was very common for men to experience difficulty urinating and that it was likely psychological, but it's come to a point where it is affecting me so much that I'm beginning to think he may be incorrect. They will occur seemingly randomly, sometimes days apart, sometimes a week or two apart. When they occur I find that I have to squeeze my abdomen so much that I literally ""see stars"" and begin to feel lightheaded. There is no extraneous variables I can think of that could be affecting me psychologically, it's not like there is anyone in my home who is not usually there when these episodes occur. I'm just really at a loss for an explanation as to how my being unable to pee in my own bathroom is just a psychological issue and not something more. I do however think it's reasonable to assert that my having difficulty urinating in public is probably psychological. Sorry for the rambling post, I'm just really frustrated and confused about this whole thing."

28F Frequent pains since IUD (Gynecology),"Height: 1,71m
Weight: 64kg
Sex: female
Age: 28
Never been pragnant

I already asked my gynecologist, but I don't trust her much and would have to wait another six months to get a new one. I just like to have more diverse information from other doctors. 

I got my first ever IUD (copper without hormones) on September 20th. Since then I have reoccuring pain in my uterus that feels crampy and like stabbing. On the first few days it was horrible like a dagger out of no where and heat flashes, but it declined so I was hopeful. After a week in went away slowly, but came back on my first period stronger than ever. I had to constantly take Ibuprofen 800mg to be able to function. I went to my first check up a few days later. My gynecologist informed me that the IUD is in place and that I was previously informed that my period will eventually get stronger, longer and more painful.
Yes, it was also way longer with brown spotting at the beginning and end (over all ten days with about seven to eight days of normal bleeding). It wasn't stronger. But the pain was almost unbearable. I never had a problem with painful periods. Barely had to take pain medicine at all.

She suggested that the IUD could be in place but lays inclined so that my uterus has to push it in place.

I thought that maybe I have to deal with the pain the first few periods, but cramps and stings also occur randomly throughout the month. There are peaceful days and BAM, sudden pain. It's disrupting and mentally exhausting. I'm laying in bed right now waiting for my pain meds to work, because I woke up with pain. I'm afraid to do anything that requires concentration and accuracy. I'm afraid of sexual intercourse. I had sex but felt the IUD and even experienced pain in some positions. Right now outside of the period the pain isn't as strong, but it's still irritating. 

The pain is also leaning to the right as if the IUD is slanted in that direction. My uterus is about 8cm long, the outer wall is too thin for a copper chain. I was told that my uterus is bent forwards, but this shouldn't cause any trouble. 
There was some trouble with the insertion. My cervix seems to be quite strong, so that the first try on September 16th failed — I had to come back and another gynecologist in the practice used more force with success. 

Question: Is it possible that the pain will go away outside of my period and become less painful? Is there any reason to be concerned with pain outside of my period? Should it be removed already because of my description above? 

I would like to keep it, especially since it was quite expensive. But if the pain is expected to stay as it is, I'd have to remove it."

It’s only on the left side. Never on the right. When I press on it, I get a dull pain. 

I’ve mentioned it in the past to my primary care physician, but it wasn’t particularly obvious that day so I don’t think she was concerned. I also felt weird about knowing that I have a hard nodule inside my mouth/throat, too, since it’s incredibly far back there. I’m used to touching the back of my mouth because I get tonsil stones and I will press on my tonsil with my finger to remove them.

I’m concerned. I have had a history of HPV according to an old OBGYN, although my OBGYN now says I don’t have it. With the recent media coverage about HPV being linked to throat cancer, I’m worried. Please let me know if I should be worried and if so, what type of doctor I should go to."

**Problem:**

Hello everyone. I am a high schooler who is in need of general dermatological support and/or identification. I have several bumps spreading throughout my neck, face and chest area. It's slightly itchy, gets worse at night, and is quite sensitive to touch and temperature. It's been about 1.5 to 2 months since first signs showed up on my right collarbone.

&#x200B;

**Background:**

I've lived with eczema for my entire life and have dealt with many flare-ups in the past, but over the past two months or so, I've developed several bumps along my neck and chin area. This first started towards the end of this summer, when I went swimming with a couple of friends at a nearby indoor pool. About 3-4 days later, I began noticing red bumps along my right collarbone. I thought it may have been some sort of reaction to the pool water from my sensitive skin so I put lotion on and kind of left it there. Over the next week or so, my mom said that it was spreading and quite quickly at that. By now, it covered my entire upper chest on both sides of my neck and was creeping down my shoulders, but the bumps were not as densely packed as they are now. I went to see a GP and he referred to me to the same allergist that I had seen regarding my past eczema flareups. I had to wait about two weeks and by the time the allergist saw it, the affected area covered my entire neck (even the back) and a lot of my shoulders. However, it hadn't entirely covered under my chin yet. He prescribed me the cream mentioned above and asked to see in two weeks and also referred me to a dermatologist regarding my foot fungus (more on this later).

Now, my follow up is this upcoming thursday, but the affected area has reached my face and chin. When the rashes(?) first started, there was little to no itchiness (I'm usually quite tolerant towards itchiness because of my history with eczema), but now, the area is quite a bit redder and itchier to the point where I notice myself trying to scratch it unconsciously (but I don't lose sleep over it or anything). I also noticed that similar spots are appearing in different places around my body such as my stomach and legs (in groups of one or two).

I don't think it's contagious, as my girlfriend rests her head on my shoulders quite a lot and she hasn't shown any symptoms of my skin problems (neither has anyone in my family shown any symptoms). I know I was referred to a dermatologist for my issues regarding my foot, but I'd really like to bring up my neck problems with them as well. However, my appointment is in 6 months and, at the current rate of development, I don't think this problem can wait that long. Should I just drop by a nearby hospital and ask to see a doctor?

Any sort of help or guidance would be appreciated and if you need better pictures, I'll ask one of my family members for help once they get home from work.

Worried.,"Stress Or Brain Tumor??  Female, Age 15, Height 5,4, weight, 127. Medications: Antibiotics and Antidepressants.

So, recently I’ve been having problems. I Stress Or Brain Tumor??

So, recently I’ve been having problems. I have this spot on the back of my head that hurts at random times. Not all the time though, I’m thinking it might be a pinched nerve but I’m not sure.

I have been having abdominal pains (left and right side) also neck pain and recently I have been having trouble with my words (I’ll frequently stutter but it’s not terrible) I don’t know if it’s my mind playing tricks on me, sometimes I’ll be dizzy. (But it’s not incredibly dizzy) and I’ll have head pains (or headaches) often. I’m getting checked on Friday but it’s been going on for weeks. I’m scared it’ll be too late. 

I also recently went to the fair and the spot on my head (it’s a tiny spot) started hurting. I took note that when I moved my head it hurt for a split second but didn’t continue (I don’t know if it hurt due to the movement or just hurt at that moment) I really hope it’s nothing serious. I’m only 15 and I’m fully aware that brain tumors are sometimes rare and not all of them are bad but I am terrified. 

Please don’t joke around down below, because I have terrible anxiety and if I see anything that is meant to scare me. I might just have a panic attack unless you want that. I just really want answers and I’d appreciate anyone who comes by to be respectful. Also, sometimes when I smile or laugh, the back of my head hurts (I think it could be because of the muscles that tighten together).

I’ll also have ear pain and jaw pain, and the back of my neck and shoulders will hurt from time to time.

Also, in the mornings when I wake up. I get tension in the back of my head. I feel as if it’s a warning. I’m only 15 so I don’t know if it’s even possible but my friend had actually had one before.

Update/follow up??

So— I went to the doctors and turns out my blood test came out great. But, I ask my doctor about brain tumors and she asked if I wake up in the morning with nausea or vomiting. I don’t. 

Today, I have ringing in my left ear and it’s been going on for about thirty + minutes now. I want to get an MRI badly just to ease my mind but I’m scared. 

I know it could be tinnitus but I’m not sure- I recently got proscribed antidepressants and have been taking them. Could it just be the side affects? I’m really worried.

I also started getting a fuzzy feeling in my head, it’s gone away now but I always get these head pains. this spot on the back of my head that hurts at random times.

Also, in the mornings. I’ll feel a tight feeling in the back of my head. It doesn’t happen all the time but isn’t that a red flag?"

So, I have been having constant gastro issues where I'll have ""flare ups"" of bloody diarrhea (tests in the labs in hospital have came back positive for blood too), vomitting, severe stomach pain and severe dehydration mainly. Thats been happening for a long while on and off. Long story short i had a colonoscopy and endoscopy down my throat done yesterday and it came back negative for crohns or ulcerative colitis, he said I didn't prep well (i drank all of the prep, as i was in the hospital a day before getting it so they also knew for a fact i did) and he said that everything looked fine pretty much. I got diagnosed with gastritis and thats it but would that explain the bloody diarrhea and the constant flare ups? The doctor talked to me when i was completely out of it on medications and all I remember him saying was pretty much it looke good but they took biopsies just to check? What could those entail? Would he jus take a biopsy for no reason? Was there a polyp? Could me not having good enough prep have hindered him seeing more? I'm extremely anxious because now that I'm alert I have all these questions and no one to ask them too, so I'm here. Thank you in advance."

Injured my knee playing basketball yesterday.,"26, male, 5'6, 160ish pounds, white, current medication is clonazepam .5mg 3x a day.

Had a family event in florida this weekend and I'm from the northeast. The weather in florida was much, hotter than I'm used to.

Yesterday around 2 I played a game of basketball for fun with my cousins. Being a former athlete and now that I do physical work I know I should have stretched or warmed up a bit before I played. Anyway, about 10 minutes into the game I was chasing the ball trying to keep it from going out of bounds, jumped, and landed in a weird way for my knee. It hurt pretty bad, but it wasn't like I was on the ground.

Upon landing I felt a sharp pain in my knee and instantly knew I'd landed in a funny way and would have to stop playing. I was able to limp off the court and just say I hurt myself and needed to stop playing.

I limped all day but was able to continue my family's party without too much concern. People saw I was hurt but no one figured it was serious because i was walking and when sitting i was able to act like nothing was wrong.

Now, I did start drinking beer about 40 minutes after i hurt my knee. It was a family party, i wasn't driving, and figured it would sort of mask the pain so maybe that's why i held it together as well as i did for the 9 hours i was there. I drank to the point where you know you're a bit drunk, but not falling over, or throwing up or anything. 

When I got back to my hotel it was around 1130 at night so around 9 hours after the injury. When i looked at my leg it was super swollen and very painful to stand at all/put weight on it.

When I woke up this morning, my whole knee was swollen and it was incredibly painful to walk. I had and still have a severe limp and cannot walk without alot of pain.

I flew back today and had to use a wheelchair at the airport as I couldn't walk through it.

I'm home now and took advil and I should note it feels like its helping a bit. For the first time since it's happened, I have no pain right now as I'm lying down.

I have great insurance and am going to go to an urgent care facility tomorrow to get this checked out. So to any doctors reading I am going to receive medical attention tomorrow.

I guess I'm posting here because I'm just curious how long these sorts of injuries last. I work construction and am hoping I'll only limp for a week or two!"
Stomach pain and bleeding,"Hi I'm a 20 year old Male and when i go for a number 2 there is blood. It happened before like a year ago but went away in a day, now it's been happening for like a week.

Should I put my walking boot back on?,"23 years old, 5'10, weigh 185 pounds, male, no medications, non smoker, no previous medical issues. 

&#x200B;

 So last summer (2018) I got a chip fracture in my ankle from playing soccer. Didn’t need surgery but was suppose to wear a walking boot for 8ish weeks. I ended up taking it off around 4-5 because I felt completely fine. But ever since my ankle gets randomly super sore at times and feels like it may snap even though I’ve played soccer again since then and never got hurt again, but sometimes it feels insanely sore, sometimes not at all. Should I put the boot back on for a couple weeks and see if it helps?"
Feeling of dry patches inside mouth. Over producing saliva,"Male 28.

For maybe a year now I've been having this issue, not got round to seeing anyone as I love in Korea and my Korean isn't great so going to see a doctor has it's barriers but I can go and muddle through if it would be worth it.

This problem randomly occurs sometimes a couple of days a week or sometimes not for weeks at a time. Sometimes it's worse if I have drank coffee, or after a weekend of drinking, but sometimes, like this morning, it happens regardless. 

It's hard to describe but the feeling is that the inside of my cheeks are dry, but at the same time I feel like I can't relax my tongue because I feel like I need to move saliva from under my tongue and swallow it. So over the day neck and throat begin to feel strained. Then eventually it just goes away. 

If anyone can give me any indication to what it might be and what I might be able to do to help it or prevent it I would appreciate it. Sorry if the description is vague, I can't quite describe it to myself."
What is this Red Area on my forearm?,"[Here are some Images](https://imgur.com/a/YcQW6qp)

Hey, I am Male, 19, and I have been dealing with this red area / line on my forearm for about 2 months now, at first I thought it was an allergic reaction so I took some medicine for that but that didn’t work.
There’s no pain, itchiness, or really anything associated with it, except for mild aching every once in a while. Kinda feels like it’s in my veins (only way to describe the feeling).

I don’t so drugs, and the only medication I take is the daily 24hr Zyrtec which I’ve been taking since I was a kid. No change in diet, nothing out of the ordinary which is why I wonder what this is. 

I’ve altered the second image a little to show the general shape of this redness, any insight you can give me would be amazing. I’m potentially going back to the doctor sometime this week for another thing I’ve been dealing with but I’ll ask about this then. I just thought it would go away on its own but it hasn’t. 

Thanks for any replies!"
"Dry, bumpy, white and mildly flaky patch on my (25F) upper lip.","2 months ago, a day after spending a long day in sun I noticed very dry lips and darkened lips.

Strange sleep issue (please help),"Male, 5'10, 225 lbs
Bipolar 2, on lamictal 150mg and hydroxyzine 50 prn. About 6 months ago I had a strange issue where I was trying to sleep and everytime I got close to sleeping i would have a brain zap and muscle paralysis where it felt like I was going into sleep paralysis. This repeated maybe 15 times in the night and I was unable to actually sleep until 8 am. This caused me to develop anxiety/panic attacks whenever It started getting closer to sleep time. It didnt happen again until the night before last, after taking a hydroxyzine and maybe 3 shots of vodka. And then it happened again last night. I dont feel manic at all. This is horrible and I thought it was over with. I was just starting to work through the panic I was having every night only for it to start again. I called a nurse line, a pharmacist, amd a crisis line. They didnt tell me shit. I cant get a hole of my doctor because they're not open on weekends. Any advice"
My heart feels like it’s doing weird things at times?,"Age:24 height: 4’11 sex: F Race: black duration: 4-6 years Complaint: heart (I think) 

Hi! So I’m having this issue where my heart sometimes feels as if it’s leaping in my chest. I will be relaxing or doing absolutely nothing, and suddenly feel this lurch in my chest. I have no idea if it’s my hiatal hernia or something- can that cause those feelings? 

I also have times where for no reason, my heart will just start racing. It’s so uncomfortable and scary. This happens maybe once or twice a month. I’ve had an EKG that came back normal and an echocardiogram that showed that I might have had some mild endocarditis at some point, but otherwise nothing serious.

Is this something that I need to let go, or should I visit my doctor? What specifically should I be asking them to look for? I’m afraid of sounding like a hypochondriac, but the symptoms are really anxiety inducing, especially the random racing heartbeat."

UTI pain but negative culture.,"29F, 5'6, 158 lbs, white, pain after urination/urgency/pressure, UTI, generic form Macrobid antibiotic, 100mg every 12 hours for 7 days, occasional light drinking, no smoking or drugs.

I went to the doctor with all the classic signs of a UTI on 10/03. My urine was collected and observed and was told ""there is something definitely going on there."" I was prescribed antibiotics. The discomfort lasted for 3 days and now I'm feeling no discomfort on 10/06.

However, the hospital called to tell me my culture was negative. I've done a bit of googling to understand how this is possible, but would feel more confident hearing from someone other than an online article. I get UTIs frequently and this has happened more than once with negative cultures. My doctor in unavailable for questioning until next week."
Blood pressure meds causing memory issues? Or something else?,"My 72F mother, previously in decent health started having problems with spiking bp a couple of months ago.  She would go really high, like up to 200 for the big number.  She was on bp meds but it was still happening so they switched things up.  My father has heart failure, so we thought she was maybe having anxiety about his situation, and they also started her on a dose of generic Prozac.  

Since then, she has had a terrible time of it, culminating in the last few weeks.  She complains of feeling light headed, like her insides are shaky, occasional tightness in her chest, nausea, exhaustion, insomnia, and a general feeling of being unwell.   She also has experienced terrible problems with short term memory, especially when she is feeling poorly.   She said she wasn't feeling good and I told her to call the cardiologist and she forgot she had one.  She forgot to call into work one day.  

We have been to the hospital three or four times when she was complaining about blood pressure, but now it's pretty steady around 140-150.  At the hospital they did a heart test, a brain scan (ct) which came back clear and blood work and said all looked good.   Dementia and Alzheimer's would be seen on the CT scan most likely unless she was in the very early phases of them, right?  My dad told me today she's been waking him up at night wanting him to take her to the hospital but her blood pressure hasn't been terrible.  

She has another appointment tomorrow.   She is on three different bp meds, generic Prozac and supposed to take Klonodine if the bp goes above 165.   Is there a decent chance the mediciaton may be causing this or should I likely prepare for something more serious?"
(35M) Dull lower right abdominal pain for months,"I'm a 35 year old male.  6'1, about 205 pounds, Caucasian.  No drinking, smoking, or drugs.  I admit I have a fairly unhealthy diet.  I know it doesn't help much, but I do take a multivitamin nearly every day.  No abnormal digestive symptoms.  I still eat regularly, and have fairly regular bowel movements.

Back in June, I started having a dull almost burning pain in my lower right abdomen/hip area (probably around a 3 out of 10).  It hurt more when driving, or at least when sitting in my car and going over bumps in the road.  So I was concerned about appendicitis and went to the urgent care... which did a urine test (came back with no issues), felt my stomach for sensitivity, and decided it was probably muscle pain.

I couldn't stop thinking about it though, and ended up going to the ER that same night for some peace of mind.  A CT scan with (I think iodine?  it was something they said would feel very warm and make me feel like I was urinating) contrast showed nothing abnormal.  So they again told me it was probably muscular, because they couldn't see anything wrong.  No fever, slightly elevated blood pressure attributed to the fact I was nervous about it (because it was really high when I first got there, but had decreased by the time I left), basically everything they looked at was fine.

After that, I ignored it for about 3 months, but the pain never went away.  It typically ebbs and flows a little, from a 3 to a 2 and back again.  Since it hadn't gone away after 3 months, I attempted to make an appointment with my primary care doctor.  About a week ago, a physician assistant (not my actual PCP) looked at me for about 30 seconds, again feeling my abdomen and checking for sensitivity to pressure on both sides, and rotating my hip some.  None of these caused any additional pain, so I was quickly referred to physical therapy and sent home.  But the guy barely looked at me either, so there's that.  (Oh, and my blood pressure was back to where it typically is).

Now, it does tend to vary based on how I am positioned.  So in some ways I understand the guess of muscle pain.  But honestly though, I've had muscle pain before.  While not intensely painful, this is still a type of pain unlike anything I've felt before.  And it's not the same location at all times.  Sometimes (like when I saw the PA), the pain is localized to my hip, other times it's a little further back, other times it's a little more forward.  Very occasionally, I feel it even lower, a little more toward the groin.  Rarely over the past few months, I've had a very very minor testicular ache, but I'm not sure if that's related.

Tonight in particular, it's probably back up to about a 4, and I feel it right above my hip / below the rib cage.  And if I gently press on my groin, it does feel a little sensitive, which as far as I am aware is a slightly new symptom.  It also hurts a little to laugh, which is again new.

It really feels like I need to get another opinion at this point, though if I'm just being paranoid let me know.  I've been looking around a little, and wondering if a hernia makes sense for all this?  Or if there's something that fits better that I should get checked out?  One thing that hasn't been done is an ultrasound.  Is that something I should ask for?"
Stomach Ulcer,"Let's get to the point. I think I have a stomach ulcer. Been passing mainly greyish greenish stool and my stomach hurts a bit. Saw a little tiny bit of blood which is what had me worried.

Inability to Stay Awake,"Hi, I'm a female who just started college and am having difficulty staying awake. Initially, I brushed this off as a typical tired college kid thing at first, but recently it has begun to be a real issue.

Sometimes in high school, when I was particularly tired, I would do that thing where my brain tells my eyes to stay open but they just... don't. The eyelids become droopy, and no matter how hard you try to pry them open, they keep closing and opening them is a workout.

Well, in the last several weeks, this is something that happens to me during almost every class period. About 10-20 minutes of sitting still causes a sudden sense of overwhelming fatigue, and my eyes close. It's something people notice, and it's uncomfortable and embarrassing because it seems like I am not trying to stay awake. A teacher was literally standing in front of me talking, and my eyelids kept drooping, and I'd make a concerted effort to open them but they'd close. It feels like I am half-asleep when this happens; I know that things are going on around me, but when I'm jolted awake (usually by a loud noise, by someone touching me, talking to me, or by the terror that I've actually fallen asleep), I feel like I've been sleeping.

I know I don't get the most sleep in college, but I also don't get the least. Moreover, this happens often even when I do get a good night's sleep. There are people who get far less sleep than I do, and yet I do not see anyone else having this issue, whereas other people have noticed it when it happens to me (which is a LOT).

I'm seeking guidance or advice on what this could possibly be. Given how much it happens (maybe 5-10 times a day for 10-ish minutes on and off (that 10 minutes is me fighting sleep)), I'm starting to wonder if it's more than being tired. Any advice would be appreciated.

edit: I should note that this ONLY happens when I'm sitting/not moving for prolonged periods of time. I could have gotten 2 hours of sleep, but if I am talking or spending time with people, the fatigue does not set in. Yet, in class, even after a good night's sleep, 10 minutes of class time is enough for my eyes to start weighing down."

My rheumatologist told me when starting methotrexate to go to the doctor if I have a fever. This guideline is hard to gauge because I frequently have low grade fevers due to the autoimmune condition. Last week I had the sniffles for a few days, which felt like fall allergies. Not bad at all. Had a low grade fever, but again that’s not unusual. Friday night it was a legit fever (101) and I figured I would go to urgent care in the morning. Woke up in the middle of the night with temperature 104, vomiting, shaking chills, and generally feeling awful. I went to the ER where they did very thorough testing including for sepsis (my heart rate was high and blood pressure low) but nothing turned up except high WBC. I left with a prescription for antibiotics and Zofran. 

Did I overreact by going to the ER, when I could have waited for urgent care to open in four hours? I’m trying to figure out the balance between seeking appropriate care and not running to the doctor for every little thing."

Primary complaint: Tingling in my right leg

Yesterday evening I hastily sat on my bed in a weird fashion, by lifting my leg way up and having the knee bent, as I sat down, I suddenly felt something stretch in my leg with lots of tingling, this was quite unpleasant and I jerked my torso back and my leg forward, this eased the “something in my leg is stretching” feeling, however a bit of that tingling still persists, especially in some positions where I have my knee closed to my body, I do not move my leg much because of this, but I walk just fine.

Will this go away? Is there something I can do to improve this/ avoid further issues?

I try to healthy most of the time.

So I'd say about every two to five months I have this stomach problem, It starts with a mild stomach cramp and about an hour later it turns to quite painful stomach aches. I start to sweat and feel like I have to poop but can't. Then I feel it come on and I go to the bathroom dry heave, my mouth fills with nothing but saliva and i spit it out, i have diarrhea and then I puke about 6 times and then a few minutes after I have a mild pain again and it's over. The whole thing lasts about 2 hours from the first stomach ache to the last. The pain is pretty unbearable for about 30 minutes. At first I thought it could be diet related but the last two times I had it has been since I went on a diet. Is there anything that could be causing this? Anything I can do to prevent it?"

"Options for ovarian cysts? Unbearable pain, cannot function","background: 22F, normal BMI, no other conditions

I am an EMT and am currently in nursing school so I am no stranger to how the healthcare system works, but I'm beyond frustrated with this issue. I went to an OBGYN for severe LLQ pain and the ultrasound showed one large cyst that had already burst, and another small one ~3cm. I was sent home with Advil, fine whatever. A week later I was passing out and throwing up from pain and it was a Sunday after hours so my husband convinced me to go to the ER. They gave me some morphine, but upon looking at the new ultrasound they gave me in the ER (through which I was crying from the pain of the wand pressing on my uterus and ovaries)  they scoffed at how small the cyst was. I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS ""SMALL"" CYST BUT IT IS UNBEARABLE. Today a week later from ER, I am again nauseous and unable to sit upright from pain. I've been using Advil, a TENS unit, lidocaine gel, muscle relaxation exercises, heat, and every pain relief effort know to man, apart from opioid.
i'm honestly considered the ER again bc I can't stop crying its SO bad.  I don't want to be labeled drug seeking, if anything I just want to get rid of this cyst! I've missed 3 days of classes so far!

Sorry for the wall of text, but does anyone have any advice at all of how to releive this pain?! I will do anything it is unbearable and I cannot function. I have a Mirena IUD that I think is related. The pain also spikes with the peristalsis of my small and large bowel, as well as bowel movement being extremely painful. Bloating as well.  fever was 101.1 but went down after the first cyst popped. Ovary has circulation so the ruled out torsion."
Possible sodium overdose?,"I work in a group home with disabled adults. One of my clients is a 64 year old man with palsy and other cognitive problems.

He was taken to the ER and had bloodwork done, he was very low in sodium. My boss, who is not in any way a qualified medical professional, told staff to give him one teaspoon of salt with every shake. I saw her looking at the boost bottles and doing math ""in her head"" about the RDA of sodium. After one day of doing this, he had a pencil eraser sized water blister form on his cheek. I tried to raise my concerns with her about the salt, that it might be a toxic dose, but she insists that's what the doctor told her to do (she has lied in the past). He is on the drug Carbamazepine as well as other drugs. Thank you in advance for any advice, I am very worried about this man."
19F Swollen big toe,"A few days ago, the right side of my big toe on my right foot was in a lot of pain. After a day, the pain pretty much left. It started hurting again when I put on a pair of my Vans to go to a class. I’m assuming that they’re two small for me because my big toe is hurting again, only not as much as before, although my mom thinks it has something to do with me painting my toes that’s causing the pain. When I got out of the shower today, I noticed that the right side of my big toe had turned kind of yellow. I squeezed that side of my toe and puss oozed out. Now the right side of my toe is red and swollen, only not as much as it was prior to me squeezing the puss out. Should I be worried? The only time it’s really been hurting recently is when I’m wearing socks and shoes. I’m trying to walk around my house with just sandals on and it doesn’t hurt. I’m genuinely worried that I’ll need surgery or that I’m a diabetic due to my poor diet and recent lack of exercise."
I see vision trails after slow moving objects – is this really caused by astigmatism?,"Female, 35, white, 5 foot 5, 99 pounds. Medical History: Microscopic colitis, Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome/Inappropriate sinus tachycardia, for which I take the following medications: Entyvio, propranolol, florinef, vitamin D. Also just started terbinafine. Area of concern: vision.

  

So as the title says, for a while I’ve had a problem where I’ll see a trail following slow moving objects. It is usually more transparent than the real object, and I see it more in low light environments, or when a light colored object is moving against a dark background. I have also tried closing each eye at a time, and I still see it. 

A bit of back story:

This all started in March of 2019. At the time I was taking humira, propranolol, florinef, and had just started taking budesonide (but I’d been on that before), and also my cardiologist increased the dosage of my corlanor (from 2 to 3 pills a day). I also remember I had a cold, and I was taking Tylenol to help. So before going to bed that night I had taken probably about 5 to 6 pills. 

During the night I woke up and looked at my phone. I noticed that when I moved it, I was seeing a trail of duplicate phones moving with the phone. When I stopped moving the phone the images would catch up, and the phone would become one again. 

The next morning I told my doctors, and they seemed to think it was the result of increasing the corlanor, which they said can cause visual disturbances. I was told to stop taking it indefinitely. 

But even after stopping the medicine, I noticed I was more sensitive to bright lights. And as the months went on I still continued to see the trails, only now they were happening in the daytime, leading me to think that either the corlanor caused permanent damage to my eyes, or it was never the corlanor to begin with. 

So finally after this had been going on for 8 months, I was referred to an ophthalmologist. I had never been to one before, so it was very overwhelming having to quickly pick between a bunch of lenses, to the point where I felt like I might have been second guessing myself, or picking one even though I wasn’t sure if it was right. After doing the tests, the ophthalmologist said that I had “astigmatism with \_\_\_\_\_.” Unfortunately I was so overwhelmed I don’t know what the last part was, it just sounded very medical and I stupidly didn’t ask him to repeat it. He seemed to think my whole life I’ve just been overcompensating, and it could have partly been the medicine or just the fact that I’m getting older. My actual vision though was 20/20!

So my question is, can astigmatism really be the cause of all of this? I have looked up astigmatism and vision trails but can’t really find anything. And then there’s the part of me that wonders if he just told me I had astigmatism based on my answers from picking the lenses when I wasn’t confident with my choices. 

I guess I’d just like to know what other doctors opinions on this are, as I won't know until after I've bought the glasses if they will even help. Can astigmatism really cause this kind of vision problem?"
Constant pulsating sensation in the back of my head,"Gender: Male

I feel like my head is pulsating. 
It's been almost a year since it started and it never stops.
I'm doing boxing five days a week, but don't spar often and during training the pulsating is the most intense.

"Lymphocytes decreased, monocytes increased - post tooth extraction","I'm Male, 23 years old, 123lb, 5.8ft.

I extracted a molar tooth 5 days ago. Since then, every night I wake up feeling dizzy, disoriented, I feel like my heart is pounding fast. I usually just go back to sleep, but last night it was a bit overwhelming so I decided to visit ER to get myself checked. ER dentist told me that there is no visible infection on extraction site, EKG shows steady heart rate of 75bpm, my blood pressure was 130/80, which is a bit higher than it usually is, since I naturally have a low blood pressure.

I was sent to cardiologist. Cardiologist told me that I should do my blood analysis for sedimentation, CRP, TSH, red blood cells, and general blood image.

There were 2 params out of the ordinary-

LYM are 24.4%, where the normal is 25.0-40.0%

MON are 13.5%, where the normal is 2.0-12.0%  


Anecdotally, I did a preventive blood analysis 25 days ago, where my LYM were 27.3% and my MON were 10.3%. That blood result was completely fine.

I do also have a history of panic attacks, and I'm suspecting that I might have just had a streak of panic attacks for the last few days.

Could panic attacks be to blame for my blood results, is this in general something I should worry about?

I should also note that I didn't eat much for the last few days because of pain in jaw when chewing, so I just ate when necessary. I did drop a few pounds in the last week because of poor diet.

Thank you for your time!"
[ophthalmology/neurology] - son has developed extremely high myopia in left eye with what appears to be rapid progression.,"i'll try to keep this as brief as possible (i will fail, but appreciate your patience and willingness to get through this):

26M, caucasian/armenian, nonsmoker, very casual drinker (fewer than three drinks per month), no drug use, 5'6"", 160, very fit and athletic.  no health concerns other than the ones described below (doesn't even get colds).

was diagnosed in 1994 with opsoclonus-myoclonus (likely irrelevant here so i'll not bore you with what that is or how it has affected his life since, but it is why i'm still heavily involved in his medical life even though he's 26)  
was diagnosed in 2016 with acoustic neuroma (3cm) on left side, underwent successful translab brain surgery resulting in complete removal of the tumor but which also left him SSD on the left side.  [his neurotologist insists that recent developments could not possibly have anything to do with this surgery, and my own research indicates there's no connection --- though the timing is interesting nonetheless.]

follow up MRIs in 2017 and 2018 were clear for regrowth of the tumor, so we were told no need to follow up for five years.

with respect to his eye history:

eye appts in his youth showed a very, very mild astigmatism in left eye, 20/20 in right.  this was still the case at his last eye exam, a month after his brain surgery, in march 2016 -- right eye 20/20, left 20/40.  (we went in shortly after surgery due to dry eye resulting from it, and also to avoid any eye strain that might intensify his post op headaches.)  he was given a very slight correction in his glasses.

as he has had no complaints in the past three years, we have not followed up on annual eye exams (especially since in 2016 his eyes were about the same as they were ten+ years prior).  

a month ago he mentioned he was having a hard time reading his computer monitor, and dug out his glasses (which he never wore - another reason we blew off eye exams, like f'ing idiots).  i made an eye appt, no big deal.

a few days before his appointment, he got sand in his eye at work, and was referred via workers comp to an ophthalmologist [a well-reviewed one, surprisingly).  the sand was by then gone and he was treated for a slight abrasion, but the doc mentioned that he was 'extremely near sighted in the left eye' and told us it was the sort of thing that would require a 'special contact lens'.  i immediately suspected it was a result of the surgery (which is why i called his neurotologist - as referenced above - the next day.)  he recommended we follow up with an optometrist (appointment was already scheduled, of course, but we had to push it out two weeks - from 9/14 to 10/5 - due to annoying scheduling conflicts).  

this surprised me greatly, since obviously his last exam three years prior had been basically fine.  i asked for the acuity - 20/35 right, 20/75 left.

we went to the eye doctor yesterday, with me privately expecting a cataract (especially since he was on steroid therapy as a baby when diagnosed with the OMS).  upshot is, i WISH it was a cataract:

no cataract  
healthy eyes, overall (nerves look good, etc)  
he could not see the big E on the monitor  
he is -7.25 in the left eye  
she was unable to correct his vision with soft contacts or glasses  
his left cornea is steep, however (which i know now is keratoconus - shitty), so she WAS able to correct him to 20/40 with a hard lens  
she mentioned the left eye is definitely irregular, but she sees irregularity in the right as well (she didn't expand on this), hence, urging us to follow up asap  
she also seemed infuriated that the prior ophthalmologist hadn't referred us ""outside"" with any urgency

she would not proceed with the hard lens, however, because she believes his vision is ""unstable"" (the most terrifying word she uttered) and advised us to get bloodwork and an MRI to find out what's going on behind the eye.  ""his eye is healthy; when we see a healthy eye, we have to start thinking about what's behind it.""  she also said, ""hopefully after you do that [mri/labs], you'll be back and we can make the lens"" - indicating she's not hopeful this will land anywhere in her realm, unfortunately.

and she is right about the instability, because when i called the office back to ask for the actual numbers (in my shock, i didn't note it while there), and was told he's now 20/40 in the right and 20/80 in the left.  so not only a dramatic worsening from three years ago, but also worse than three WEEKS ago, in both eyes.

obviously i am calling first thing tomorrow to make an appointment with his PCP (and to ask for referrals for MRI, ophthalmology, and labs), but i'm wondering if there's anything else i should be doing/looking for/what subspecialties we might be looking at/most critically, what the fuck could actually be causing this.  i am deep in the process of researching doctors, but i'm not sure if simple ophthalmology is even what i should be looking at.  for instance, who should be reviewing the inevitable MRI?  

i already know the keratoconus is a major problem and progressive and so that eye is probably gone barring a potential corneal transplant, especially since whatever this is is so far advanced, but i can't find anything that indicates what could be causing this.  swelling of some sort?  tumor on the optic nerve?  (would either of these cause a steep cornea though?)

any insight at all would be very much appreciated.

note:  no glaucoma or cataracts or diabetes (the latter of which is i think why she recommends labs and repeated it several times - she didn't specify, but research indicates that's what she's concerned about, though there is very little chance he is diabetic; absolutely zero symptoms of it, other than this of course) on my mom's side of the family; i wasn't close to my father's, so have no idea on that side, and we are not close to nik's father's family, so no idea on that side either.

also, even though two prior MRIs were clear, that doesn't mean there wasn't something there, since they wouldn't have been looking in the optic area - but it also seems entirely possible nothing WAS there then, since he only started mentioning his visual problems a month ago.  he's stoic so was probably dealing with it before then, but it is definitely possible this issue is less than two years old, based on how quickly it seems to be worsening (ergo, clear 2018 scan).

editing to add:  he mentioned to me after that first appointment on 9/11 that he has problems driving at nighttime (first i'd hard of it), which is another reason i'd suspected a cataract and told the doc to specifically look for in advance of our appt, and on the way to the eye doc yesterday, i asked him to cover his right eye and try to read the license plate in front of us.  he couldn't - he couldn't SEE the plate.  at all.  he has casually mentioned his eye 'burning', as well.  just adding in case relevant.  one last thing - his post-op dry eye ceased to be a problem after two months, so has not been a longstanding issue.

"Broken toe, how long to heal properly?","Hello! First time posting here so excuse any possible mistake.
I (F22) broke my fourth toe 20 days ago. Got it checked with X-rays, got told to buddy tape it and in 20 days I'd be gone. I broke it on my first phalanx I think, the part that's attached to the foot for clarity.

They told me I could walk on my heel and use a crutch to take away some weight.
I didn't walk on it in the first week, but I started to walk tilting my feet a little and not touching my toe to the ground because it hurt. Did this for the remaining days. Slowly removed crutch.
I called my doctor yesterday to tell him it still hurts in some positions, and the area on the upper part of the feet is sore and not comfortable to touch.
He told me to just wait for it to heal and that I don't need any other x-rays.

Since he gave me this answer, I came here to have a second opinion. Is it possible that it has healed in that short of a time? Shouldn't it take longer?

I am leaving for my holidays in 3 days and I'll probably walk a little bit and was planning on a light hike, can I do everything normally as long as it doesn't hurt or I should be better off resting and waiting more time?

I am an active person (I do Pilates, yoga and horse riding + some cardio sometimes) and I have been missing my fitness routines. When should I be able to restart doing everything without worrying about the toe hurting?

It's becoming a bit red but only pain if I touch specific parts. I want to fully decrease the chances of developing a blood clot. I'm 2 pills away from the placebo pills. Should I stop taking the pills immediately? Will stopping so suddenly increase my chances of a DVT (especially if I'm travelling)?

21M - Persisting problem with sensitive ears,"21 years old, Male, 5'10"", Don't know my exact weight, around 14 stone maybe?, White, 2 years, United Kingdom, Tinnitus, Erythromycin

This won't be concise, I'm sorry. I was hoping some of you could give me your opinion, I've been to the GP twice about my ears - once when it was started, once again recently after about two years of the problem - but they just looked at my ears with an otoscope, said they looked fine and sent me on my way. So about two years ago, in the summer break between my first and second years at university, I was listening to music a lot more frequently than I normally did, I would have my headphones pretty much every day all day, and eventually I noticed my ears were starting to feel... peculiar? After two years, I still can't think of the right word. Almost... tired? Worn out? Sensitive will do.

Either way, I went to the doctors once back at uni, and they said my ears looked fine and just to take it easy with using my headphones. I still used my headphones pretty regularly, although I remember I booked tickets to see this rapper I really liked, and I thought I'd cut out the headphones altogether so my ears would be fine to see them. Anyway, I went to the concert, I even wore earplugs for it, but probably pretty stupidly I used my headphones pretty much as soon as I got back and for the next couple days too. What do you know, in a few days, I develop tinnitus. My ears were pretty sensitive and the tinnitus was pretty bad for maybe a week or so afterward, but it went away eventually.

I continued using my headphones as I always did. It was about a year ago, I think that I started noticing my ears were getting bad. Sometimes when I'd speak even slightly loudly, there'd be a crack in usually my left ear I believe - accompanied by what felt like a nanosecond of deafness in that ear too. One day, me and my friend marathoned the Star Wars films which was a 9am to like 11pm endeavour. Not long after that, though I forget the exact time, I was on the phone to my friend and at the end of the call my - again, think it was my left ear - sort of... again, lost for words, felt less like it was worn out and more like it was done altogether, just felt unbelievably sensitive. I actually told my flatmate not to speak to me for that weekend (it was a Thursday the call happened) and I stayed in bed the whole time just to rest my ears. I felt better on the Sunday, and was back to normal on Monday.

There's been no specific incidents since then, but yeah, my ears are just sensitive pretty much all the time now. Last time I saw the GP a few months ago, she said they looked fine, although apparently there was some discharge in my left ear? Idk, she gave me some spray for it, hopefully it went away. I quit using headphones altogether, but I can't say I've seen much of an improvement, though maybe a slight one. Even relatively minor activities hearing-wise - like watching a movie, or listening to an album, not even at loud volumes - can have my ears feeling - again, not sore, but I can't find a good word, so sensitive is just gonna have to do. Even if, for example, my flatmate comes into the flat when I'm in bed, that sudden sound of the door opening from the former silence makes my ears - I can't apologise enough for the odd word choices, but it's just how I feel - recoil almost? Send some sort of signal like ""no, that's not good, we don't like that"". Sometimes when I open my mouth or move my jaw, I can hear a kind of squeak in what I think is my right ear. Interestingly, in fact, and something I didn't mention to my GP, extra sensitivity of my ears is accompanied by a soreness in my jar/jawline. Often after watching a movie or something, I'll find myself massaging my jaw. They're definitely a related issue.

It's just really frustrating, because my flatmate for example is a musician and he is constantly exposed to louder-than-healthy music either from his speakers or his gigs. and (as far as I know) his ears are fine. Another friend of mine is literally the exact same. It just worries me, I think like in the future I'll be living with a girlfriend, and every night after work she'll want to watch a movie or something to wind down and I just won't be able to handle it. I just wish I knew what was going on. Any advice appreciated.

P.S. Pretty sure I researched this and it denied my hypothesis, but I don't care, I'm pretty sure caffeine affects the sensitive of my ears. It might also be worth noting I used to drink a lot - **a lot** - of soda in the past two years."
Jawbone poking from cheek,"21f, 5’6, 178lb, occasionally drinking. 

I got all 4 wisdom teeth out in August and my bottom left extraction area is having issues. The gum line on the back tooth is dropped down to a level 10 (said by a periodontist), the other areas are healed up now completely but I still get food caught in my gums on the left side. In an X-Ray at the periodontist it showed that I wasn’t having bone growth on the left side. But now I noticed a hard stump in the back of my cheek that almost pierces through. It’s tender all along my lower jawline and it’s painful to chew after 5 minutes of eating. On the right side I don’t have a bone sticking out like this, so I’m wondering why it’s growing out so high inside my mouth."

So a few days ago I asked about when to stop using miralax because my doctor told me to take it 2 weeks after my constipation subsided to give my bowels a “break” so they if inflamed or enlarged they could have a helping hand instead of being stressed out again.

Before this I had been having extreme diarrhea that he kind of decided was probably just anxiety due to starting at uni and trying to adjust he said eat high fiber and if it doesn’t subside to go back so the weekend before a possible follow up I got very painful constipation so I went back and he told me to have one dose of miralax a day. After taking this dose everyday I have started to have normal bowel movements but when they started they were like kinetic sand and now it’s just kind of like diarrhea but extra watery and they look like they have red bell pepper chunks in them (I don’t eat red bell peppers) but I was just happy to be closer to normal until today about 15 minutes ago I really looked at one of these flakes and it wasn’t a chunk but instead it looks almost like it covers the “chunk” of diarrhea it’s attached too. Now I have had some blood on the toilet paper which I assume is from excessive wiping but the next bm if I see the blood in the stool what should I do? The doctor said if my issues don’t subside he wants me to do a scope (that would be after consulting for a follow up next week)"
Treatment for penile vitiligo?,"The pigmentation on the foreskin of my penis is lighter in some areas and i'm pretty sure this was caused by masturbating too much.

I haven't gone to a doctor because honestly this is pretty embarrassing, but with all the research I've done i'm pretty sure its vitiligo.

Strange fleshy growth inside tonsil.,"Hello!

Okay, so my tonsils are a problem. I'm 25 years old, female, and have never smoked, barely ever drink. I remember getting tonsil stones every now and then growing up; they would just show up in my mouth and I would spit them out. Early this year I started getting them very frequently, so I decided to investigate this a little further and found out all about tonsil crypts and tonsil stones. Man, was that a revelation! On that same day, I decided to poke around with a q-tip and I was surprised at how many came out. Quite gross, but very satisfying.

Anyway, that solved my problem for a little while, and I started getting them less and less frequently, at least until they started showing up more often again a few months ago -- every week or so I start feeling like there is something in the back of my throat, I will investigate, and sure enough, one of those pesky stones will be poking out of my left tonsil (always the left), only for me to prod at it, get it out, and then a few more in the process. I'll admit none of this is very orthodox: sometimes I'll just do it on the spot with (probably) unwashed hands and sometimes I'll poke around so much that the q-tip will come out a bit bloody.

But okay, now on to my problem! Last night I woke up at around 6am, checked my phone to see if my boyfriend had texted (he was travelling overnight), and then I felt a tonsil stone end up on my tongue, so I spat it out. A few hours before at work I had that ""something in the back of my throat"" feeling, so why not, I was awake and decided it was time for a clear up (I hate that this is my life lmao) -- a couple of stones came out, but the q-tip was very bloody, more that ever before, and then I noticed this (I don't even know how to describe it) dark, almost black (I assume bloody), stringy piece of flesh poking out from inside my tonsil with what I thought was a big tonsil stone on it, but what I can only assume is pus, because it never separated.

I have pushed it back in but I can still feel something very faintly bothering me back there (probably because I know it is there) and I made the horrendous mistake of googling about it, which didn't come up with any cases similar to mine, but instead constantly suggested tonsil cancer. I know, what was I trying to achieve with that. But the thing is, I have been worried sick all day, to the point where I have barely eaten. I am flying to the US in almost 24 hours for a two week vacation, so I can't really get a GP appointment and get some peace of mind, which is probably adding to the problem. I just can't help but think of the worst since it looks so sinister and rare, and it's really putting a damp on my oncoming vacation already.

I don't really have any visible inflammation, pain anywhere, or anything other than still feeling the sensation that something is in there. I'm trying to tell myself that it is probably just a bit infected from all the poking (I can't remember when the last time was, though), and it will go away on its own and that everything is okay.

But I still can't help but feel very helpless. What the heck is it? Any ideas? AM I DYING? Any input would be, of course, appreciated. Please let me have a happy holiday! :) :("
Small itchy cluster of red bumps on abdomen,"Hello doctors of reddit. I've got an issue.

Standard info - female, age 23, white, 5'10"" and about 155lbs residing in Phoenix, AZ. Not currently on any new medications and haven't changed anything in my diet recently. I drink socially once or twice a month and don't smoke anything. I've been taking meloxicam 7.5mg for about two weeks on and off for pain management from a car accident and I take adderall 10mg twice a day - been on that for about 8 years now. I recently moved to a new apartment (2 weeks ago) but haven't changed ANYTHING (no new soaps, products of any kind). I got stung by a scorpion on my finger about 2 weeks ago while moving (I also moved two weeks ago) but those are the only things that have been abnormal. (side note-I am having issues with my washer and dryer - could it be from a bad wash cycle not rinsing soap completely???) 

************* the actual issue ************* 
I woke up with a small cluster of red dots on my stomach two days ago (Friday) . Originally, they looked almost like a friction rash because they were just red, flat, and doing absolutely nothing to bother me. They're located right an my abdomen right next to my hip on the lower left side. The first evening after noticing them, the dots started to itch (so about 12 hours later). Today, they're twice as itchy and extremely annoying. I am a fitness instructor, so I'm wondering if it's something caused by just not changing clothes fast enough after a workout? They seem to be right where the waistband of my leggings would sit. Would a friction rash turn into something like this? I taught 3 cycling classes Friday but showered and changed between all of them. The rash hasn't spread, but it did seem to get more inflamed last night (first night they looked the same the next morning). Benadryl  antiitch gel helps the itch, but only for a short amount of time. The black fuzzies are from using the gel and then having my shirt shed on me 🤷🏼‍♀️  I do have a few other red spots on me, but not in clusters. They look more like acne and it's only on my thighs and are single bumps spread far apart with no itching or other symptoms. I just started a new job and don't have insurance until the middle of next week, so I figured reddit would be my best shot at some peace of mind. 

The rash is not ONLY itchy today, it feels hot.

"23F, I think I'm becoming lactose intolerance?","Might be a stupid question, but can you develop an interlorance to dairy product at my age? 

I don't smoke, drink, or do any drugs. I mainly drink water and try to follow a *kinda* healthy diet. I have lost 11lbs since June, however i am still obese (roughly 250lbs~) and i am 5'3.

Medical history:
   - 2017: Healthy pregnancy/vaginal birth (september), DX gallstones(november), PPD/PPA.
   - 2019: DX gastritis (February), began taking Nexium 80mg daily. Had surgery to remove gallbladder in June, haven't taken Nexium since. 

Medications: 
   -  currently only take my birth control, Sprintec, and have been on it since 2017.

I don't workout, I work in a hospital as a CNA so I am on my feet quite a bit/moving. I have never had problems with milk/cheese/ice cream/dairy in general, in fact I LOVE milk and cheese! However, since my surgery and stopping the nexium, anytime I have dairy products I notice i have diarrhea, get cramps and get a little bloated. It is completely not normal for me. It's not terribly painful, just inconvenient and a little annoying to deal with. I notice i am becoming more sensitive, as I can't eat any dairy products without having to go to a bathroom within 30-45 minutes, maybe even sooner than that. 

if you need more info, please let me know. I just wonder if this is something more? or if its ""normal"". I do plan on making an appointment with my PCP when they come back from a medical leave they've taken."
Emergency post my father is having severe abdominal pain,"Age : 54
Gender : Male
Medical history : diagnosed with high blood pressure
Smoker

Hello,
My father is 54 .
The pain is in lower abdominal area having sever pain. 
I have no hospital access . Due to a specific area related matter. Everything is closed.
He is vomiting every food he had including the water.
I don't know what started this.
He has been diagnosed with high blood pressure since then we checked up many times but his blod pressure stayed normal. He is vomiting any food he is having. The pain is not dialing down  or going away. I am still looking for a physician in my area. 
The pain is in the lower abdominal area. The vomit is not smelly or anything. And he is saying he didn't have a proper bowel movement since the morning. He is vomiting whole portions of the food.
Can anyone help?"
Cold/virus symptoms for a month and donating white blood cells,"Caucasian 26 year old male, 6'1"", 165 pounds. Cold symptoms since Aug 19th. Located in Northeast United States.

I thought I was done dealing with a cold after over week of symptoms and donated white blood cells on Aug 27th.
Have been dealing with swollen lymph nodes, feeling of fluid in middle ear and sore throat ever since. Been doing a lot of sinus rinses so minimal nasal congestion. Haven't had fever but usually don't when I'm sick, just lots of fatigue.
Went to the doctor twice, got 2 kinds of antibiotics (zpack and doxycycline) which didn't help, and got tested for basically everything they had with all results coming back clean. (not mono, strep, lyme, blood work came back with no problems)

I should mention than I've had trouble with sinusitis/upper respiratory infections since I was a kid and frequently required antibiotics, but never had something that lasted this long as an adult. I'm also allergic to dust mites, but this is a lot stronger than the the usual symptoms I get.
I've tried basically all the herbs i can find, been eating raw garlic, ear drops, going to the sauna and steam room, sinus rinses. Nothing seems to be helping.

Thanks in advance for any replies.

Posting about my father who had NSTEMI heart attack 9 days ago. M/78.,"My father — 78 years of age who was admitted to CCU after having dull aching central chest pain last week. He already had 7 stents from 2010 .   Also,  pace maker in 2012 .... one of the leads needed replacement along with a new pacemaker re-inserted in 2016.
Troponin raised to 509 ... 
developed fever after 24 hours...CRP
was 1.4 on admission ... daily rising ..
finally 87.5
Could not find the source of infection
Finally we pointed out he had a molar
Tooth infection ... was waiting for root canal .... x Ray in hospital max facial 
revealed some infection but they were not convinced that can cause such a rise.

Although now on the NHS waiting list for extraction of the molar & then transfer to Harefield hospital for angiogram.

My question is — how risky is it to have this tooth removal  while he is on many
Blood thinners plus other subcutaneous 
Anti coagulant  plus aspirin?

Is it more risky not to eradicate the tooth infection before the heart procedure which is going to be done so as to prevent endocarditis or blood infection?"

Friend is talking about sacrificing himself to God and I’m concerned for his mental health,"Age: 21

Sex: Male

Race: Caucasian

Location: Arkansas, brain ???

My friend “Jacob” has always struggled with his mental health. For as long as I’ve known him, he’s struggled with general anxiety, depression, bad social anxiety, and disassociation. He’s never taken prescription drugs, but used marijuana daily and psychedelics occasionally to help. He’s always been an atheist, up until this past year or so. He went through several months of extreme disassociation about 8-9 months ago. He said he couldn’t emotionally feel anything for months and he didn’t know who he was as a person. Like with most mental illnesses, he seemed “fine” and like his normal self. Eventually, he told us that he had an “experience” and found God. He was pretty vague about what the experience was, but he told us that he was told to stop smoking weed and read the word of God. He started doing that and has become extremely Christian in the past 6 months. He absolutely cannot hold a conversation without turning it into something about God/Christianity. This has been a little weird for me because I’m an atheist and cannot relate to what he says/believes, but I still love him and was glad that he found something to believe in, up until last night. 

He came over to my house and started talking about God. He drank a few beers and randomly said “I’m not ever going to have a wife and I’m going to die by gunshot.” I was confused and asked him what he meant. He asked if he did die by gunshot, if I would promise to “bow down to the kingdom of God” because him getting shot would somehow be proof that God exists. He said his life is meaningless without God and that serving a higher purpose is more important than his life. To make a long story short, he eventually elaborated and said that he’s had “visions” of himself getting shot because of something he does in the name of God. He said he’s had visions of himself doing “crazy shit” outside the White House and getting shot. He believes this would be a sacrifice to God and would show people that God is real. He kept saying “it’s going to happen, give it 3 years” and begging me to believe in God at that point or before it happens. He said God came to him and set him on this “mission” of being a Martin Luther King Jr type figure and dying/getting killed in order to show people what faith in God is like. He said he’d be in pure bliss, that he’s ready to die, and I should be happy for him *when* it happens. 

Overall, I’m concerned. I have no problem with Christianity, but I fear that he is going to kill himself or do something to get himself killed (like doing “crazy shit” outside of the White House) because he believes that that is what God is telling him to do. The change from hardcore atheist to devout, damn near radical Christian has happened so fast. I truly don’t want to diminish his beliefs, but I worry that he is struggling with mental issues and it’s presenting itself in the form of newfound Christianity because he knows that will make people less concerned about him. After he explained his visions and his “mission” of getting shot, he said “I’m drunk and would have never told anyone that in my entire life” so that makes me believe he’s been hiding these thoughts because he knows they’re not okay. 

I would love to know if this sounds like a possible mental illness. If it does, what should I do? Even if there’s not a diagnosable mental illness going on, and he just truly believes that he needs to sacrifice himself in the name of God, how should I handle that?  If anyone has any advice or knows any subs that would be more appropriate for this issue, please let me know."
Could a yeast infection have shown up as chlamydia on my 5 in one swab?,"Hello all, I’m(20y.o. Female) currently freaking out and am very confused. 

Last week I experienced some burning with urination, and went to urgent care and took one of those self-administered vaginal swab tests as directed by the PA. She also prescribed fluconazole as a precaution since I told her I have chronic yeast infections. After a few days the burning went away on its own, but I did notice the usual symptoms I get with a yeast infection so I took the fluconazole (single dose) . Today I got the results back from the vaginal swab and the PA said I came back positive for chlamydia. She prescribed me meds for it.

My question is if a yeast infection could have been mistaken for chlamydia in the test. I am monogamous with a single sexual partner, and both of us have been tested in the past and came back negative (within the past year). I know it sounds naive and people will probably say “oh then you got it from him”, but I truly believe he wouldn’t cheat on me and trust him. He thinks I cheated on him now. Is it worth getting retested at a different urgent care?

EDIT: Forgot to mention sexual history. Two years ago I had oral sex a single time with my ex. My current boyfriend is the only person with whom I’ve had penetrative sex."

Dull throbbing in top left chest,"Hi all
For about 2 months Iv had an on / off (almost constant) dull throbbing in my top left chest, from my limited medical understanding it’s too high and left for my heart, I assumed it was muscle related as Iv been working out a few times a week around the time it started but it doesn’t change and doesn’t get any better with rest.
It’s located an inch or 2 above my nipple and feels an inch or so deep if that makes sense so maybe too deep for muscle.
Not really sure what’s inside me here, maybe too of my lung?
Gets a little worse at times but I can’t think of anything that triggers it, hard work out and swimming etc doesn’t change it, if anything it helps (maybe just a distraction)
Any advise what it could be? Planning to see a doctor but they are pretty useless to be honest, the kind to send me away with self help for stress (not stressed but have a busy life with family and work)

Cracked neck -> now sore back of head,40m. In bed last night I cracked my neck and felt a stimulation up the back of my head to a nerve spot on the top back right corner..this occasionally has happened to me with just light head turning to crack.

[TMI] Am I Undiagnosable?,"I'm a 21 year old female from the UK, I've been in constant pain since I was 8 years old - varying degrees of pain, of course.
I first started going to the doctors with pain throughout my abdomen and vulva which I could only describe as being set on fire from the inside out. Doctors told me that the only things it could be, I was too young to experience so signed me off, stating it would get better once I hit puberty but I only went downhill.
Around 11 years old, I got rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis but they could not figure out what was actually causing my right side pain as my appendix was not inflamed so they gave me painkillers and sent me home. By 17 I was fed up of missing school for awful period cramps and, as they were very irregular, painful and caused me debilitating migraines, I went to the doctors who gave me birth control pills and medicine to reduce the blood flow. By 19, I was bleeding heavily, every day, as well as feeling perpetually nauseous, very fatigued and having random ocular migraine attacks which also causes my 1 eye to ""glitch"" and move on it's own and dilate without my control.
I have been investigated for IBS and Endometriosis (I had an emergency laparoscopy which showed ""nothing out of the ordinary"") although have never had a scan other than an ultrasound.
I am currently on gabapentin for the nerve pain in my back and lower right abdomen and thigh which began after my surgery. I am also still on birth control pills to try and stop the bleeding. I have been given 2 options by my gynaecologist - have a baby now (despite not wanting one yet/ever and not being financially or mentally stable enough for that) or have a full hysterectomy and hope my pain magically disappears - neither of which I want to consider without an actual diagnosis.
Has anyone had similar symptoms and had a diagnoses or have a suggestion of what I could request from my doctors? I am in desperate need for help as I'm becoming depressed going through this daily pain..."
Major changes in BM consistency lasting one week,"36F, 5’11”, 180lbs, Caucasian, Northeast US. I started having very loose watery stools a day after going to an event where I ate half an apple strudel, drank three alcoholic beverages, and used several drinking fountains. It started with severe heartburn (which I never get) and then the diarrhea started 3-4 hours later. No cramping, fever, fatigue, or other symptoms. After day 3 I started following the BRAT protocol for diarrhea and treated with pepto Bismol (because Imodium was having very little effect). This made the stools less watery but still very very soft. I discontinued pepto and BRAT protocol about 16 hours ago hoping the issue would resolve but it has not.  This is concerning for me because I usually only have BMs every two to three days and they are always solid. I rarely have gastrointestinal upset (I can be sensitive to gluten but I avoid it as best I can).

So I’m destined for a trip to urgent care, I know. My question is: what can they do for me? Antibiotics? Thanks for your help."
Tired to the bone,"15F, 163cm, 107 lbs, tiredness that has been getting worse over the last 5 years.

I have seen a therapist from years 11-12 because of anxiety and self-harm issues, and because I felt awful mentally. It didn't help.

2011 - orthoscopic labrum and RC repair.  Shoulder was beat up from pitching and subluxations during basketball 
2016 - orthoscopic labrum revision repair after dislocation and retear.  The labrum didn’t receive blood flow after the surgery and it dried up.  No longer functional 
2018 - Laterjet Stabilization.  No repeat dislocations after 2016 but lots of pain and wasn’t able to develop any strength 


Currently, I’m 15 months post latarjet I am still in lots of pain. I’ve done plenty of PT and I can not hold any weight in front of me or anything overhead.   

What next?  I can’t get another MRI because of the hardware from the latarjet.  They could do another scope to see what is going on, but structurally I might be fine.  A reverse shoulder replacement seems feasible eventually but it seems too early at 34.

[18F] Recurring rash,"Hey Docs, my gf has been suffering from a reoccurring rash and it’s getting really bad. The rash seems to start on the side of her face she sleeps on, but not always. It always starts at the eyes, and then spreads to the rest of the face. A full cycle takes about five days, where the rash will begin at the eyes, spread to the whole face, and then completely heal, and start right back up again. Steroids (medrol) temporarily cure the rash.
She went to a doctor and they think it was contact dermatitis, but she made a really strong effort to remove fragrances, etc. from touching her face. This included new detergent, no makeup; she said the only thing touching her face were vanicream and vaseline. She took antibiotics (cephalexin). None of this helped. We’re really at a loss. Any help would be appreciated. Oh, and tomorrow she visits an allergist, so I’ll share the results when I get them.

I have flatulence since a suicide attempt,"Sorry english is not my first language

This is a problem I have never sought help with because it is too shameful for me. In fact, it's the first time in my life that I talk about it. I would like to know if this can get serious, in your opinion if you should go to a doctor. As uncomfortable as it may be, I am willing to live with it, but I will only consult a doctor if it is more serious.

I'm a woman, 30 years old, no other health problems at the moment, no conical disease (other than that), 1.60 m and 60 kg.

7 years ago I tried suicide through medication. I took about 10 antidepressant tablets, 10 analgesic tablets and 10 antiallergic tablets. It obviously didn't work, and they didn't do a stomach wash at the hospital, they just gave me serum and sent me back.

But from the next day I started to have flatulence. Much more than my normal would be. For about a month (maybe less, I don't remember well) I had a small stomachache with no change in stool. But flatulence persists to this day. They are small, and the frequency has decreased to 3 years so far.

Having pain in upper leg still after bone marrow biopsy,"Age/sex - 45 Female

Height/weight - 65"" and 119lbs

Race - caucasian 

Meds - gabapentin, hydrocodone, levothyroxine, ativan, and ambien

Issue - I had a bone marrow biopsy on Thursday morning in my left illeac upper hip bone. I was laying on my stomach for the procedure.  It's still extremely painful in that area (which I kinda expect even though they said I would only be sore for a couple days) but this is beyond sore, it flat out hurts and if I turn the wrong way and accidentally lay on it or put pressure on it, the pain brings me to tears.

It also radiates down to my upper thigh and side of my hip as well as my gluteal muscle and right below that all on my left side. My pain meds aren't touching the pain, nor is the gabapentin.  Is it possible the Dr. hit a nerve? Is there anything I can do besides wait? I've also tried ice but that doesn't help either.

The Dr. also drilled into my bone three separate times.  I have no idea if that's normal?

Other info - I've had issues with my blood counts being pretty off for the past year. The last one was 12,000 for my wbc which isn't bad compared to usual (platelets and a couple others were also off a little).  A couple times it's even gone to normal counts in that year.  I had my initial apt with hematology/oncology last month and he wanted the biopsy as a starting point to rule out the obvious but he said I definitely have some kind of autoimmune issue going on.  It's also possible I have MS, I have a family hx of it and have had a lot of balance issues lately and can't think of what things are called sometimes. 

I think that's all the pertinent info. At this point I would just like info on how to get some relief.  And if it's normal to still be in so much pain. I'm pretty sure I don't have a fever. I can't see the area to see if it's red or irritated."

Background: 
About an hour after dinner on September 9, I had stomach pain so severe that I was doubled over in pain crying. It was a dinner we’ve made several times before, so no new food. The pain lasted about 4 hours before I finally fell asleep.   The pain is an intense burning, but also a lot like a stabbing pain that does not stop.  It is located fairly high and central: definitely stomach. 

I get severe stomach dissension that comes on about 45 minutes-1.5 hours after I eat.  Sometimes I get the severe bloating without the pain.  For example, I ate a few bites of something the other night and 45 minutes later, I looked 7 months pregnant. The bloating is very uncomfortable, but not painful. I can provide pictures of my stomach distended, if that will be helpful. 

During all of this, there is no increase in gas or bowel movements. All of that is normal.

I know this throwaway is for “fitness” but I have not yet tried losing weight— more of a far off plan that I want to act on before I get married in six months.  However, I’ve dropped 13 lbs in the past 5 weeks.  I know this because of doctors visits with my general practitioner for unrelated items. 

The severe pain and bloating repeated after dinner four more nights that week and didn’t seem to have a rhyme or reason as to why one night I could eat without pain and another I could not.  I don’t have issues in the morning or at lunch, usually. It’s almost always dinner. I do not lay down in the time after dinner, if that matters. 

I made an appointment with a gastroenterologist the following week.  He gave me Dexilant and scheduled an ultrasound and endoscopy. He ordered bloodwork exclusively for liver enzymes—nothing else.  

The Dexilant has almost eliminated the extreme stomach pain, which is great. However, it has been replaced by some heartburn that will wake me up at night and make it impossible to go back to sleep. I’m taking tums for my heartburn. Nothing has helped the bloating. I’ve tried GasX and that does not help. 

My full abdominal ultrasound was clear. 

I had an endoscopy a few days ago.  The doctor said it looked normal besides a red spot. He took a biopsy of my small intestine to test for H Pylori and Celiac. I am waiting on those results.

I had a physical with my GP on Friday, which includes bloodwork. Everything was within normal, but my EO% was 19.5% and normal range is 1-6%. I am not sure what this means and plan on calling on Monday.

I am frustrated because something is not right, and my GI doctor has a really busy practice and is really hard to get into or get ahold of anyone.  I would love some ideas of questions to ask or threads to pull on.  This is really impacting my quality of life. Any advice is welcome."
19 M - Pelvic Pain (NSFW),"I'm 19, male, ~140 lbs, 5'11"", white, and not currently taking any prescription medication. 

Every so often, I would get a crushing feeling in my pelvis/bladder, as if all of the muscles were contracting, trying to crush themselves. I have discovered that it will get triggered when someone straddles me during foreplay or sexual intercourse. The pain lasts for varying times, though it tends to be around 2-4 hours. Hurts whether I am sitting, standing, or lying down. It does not begin to hurt right as straddling starts, but rather multiple hours after the fact. In the most recent occurrences of this happening after foreplay, I did not ejaculate, if that matters at all. 

I went to a urologist about this, where I was told he thought it was Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS) and prescribed me Detrol (Tolterodine), and was told to drink more water. The Detrol helped for a while, regardless of water intake, leading me to believe it may have been more of a problem due to the straddling. 

I have a general idea of what caused it, but I do not know what is happening, nor why it hurts so badly and for so long. Any help would be appreciated, and I can give more information as needed.

I am having severe weakness in my left hand and leg, arm and hand- to the point that it is hard to grasp, type and walk.

[19F] Should I really be taking Cephalexin for this?,"I am a 19 year old female, 5,7 and 142lbs taking no medications besides iron supplements here and there. I have a small, round purple area on my inner thigh lining that has been there since June this year. If I feel under it it’s like a pebble is there. It has not gone away at all. It doesn’t hurt unless I really rub it or apply too much pressure. It hasn’t gotten any bigger but a couple days ago puss was coming out when I barely squeezed it in the shower. The tip is red/purple and when I had gone to the doctor she said it was folliculitis, and that it had previously been infected but not anymore and prescribed me these antibiotics if it acted up. However, it has not gone away at all since June. Same size, same color, same pebble. I put Neosporin and run it under hot water but it isn’t going away. I’m wary of taking antibiotics for such a small thing, but it won’t leave. Should I go to another professional, not take the antibiotics or what? Any advice?"

My main complaint is that I’ve been having excruciating headaches since I was 16. They were extreme between 16-18 before subsiding around 18 and reappearing recently. I was under the hospital for them for a year, had CT scans, eye scans, lumbar punctures and nobody could find an obvious cause for them. We tried restricting areas of my diet (eg caffeine, dairy), medication to prevent them (beta blockers, amytriptaline) and none of these worked either. There was a theory of them being due to stress but I still had them almost daily even during holidays away from education and work. The issue is that the pain jumps around my head and in intensity. Sometimes it could be at the front, the next day it could be the temples, the back of my head or at random points on my head. Sometimes it’s a sharp pain, sometimes it’s dull. I’m honestly lost about them as I sometimes have them for a week at a time or longer, and they can make it difficult to sleep. Painkillers do not touch the headaches, even strong ones like codeine. I’m at my wits end with being in pain all the time while trying to maintain my life as a student. I’ve also taken a lot of time off work for them which is detrimental to my continuing to work there. Does anyone have any advice? I feel like I’m being ignored by the doctors and don’t know what to do because it’s impossible to live my life constantly in pain with no clear reasoning.

Strange nerve issues with left arm,"31F, 5’1”, 105 lbs.

Duration: 2 months

My left dominant hand ring and pinky finger suddenly went partially numb one day 2 months ago. It lasted all day and never went away. Within a week, my forearm, wrist, and hand running along the ulnar nerve side became partially numb. 

I’ve been to a few doctors and they said it is cubital tunnel syndrome, but I read a lot of things online that never say anything about forearm numbness. Usually information websites states only numbness in the hand/wrist region and pain in the forearm. 

I have been bracing my elbow at night and avoid bending the elbow as much as possible. It has improved, but still feels funny. There are still some minor sensory issues with the fingers, wrist, and forearm. I occasionally feel pain around the funny bone area. When I’m standing, my arm is naturally bent at a slight angle. It’s not straight like my other arm. I can straighten it, but I would need to make a conscious effort to keep it straight at my side.

On top of that, I started getting other strange symptoms in my arm/left side about a month ago. The numbness seemed to be going into my triceps. There’s a weird tug/pain in my triceps into the shoulder blade when I bend my arm overhead (to tie my hair for example). I feel tingling sensations on my other 3 fingers sometimes, not every day though. My left collarbone area feels kind of tight sometimes. I have general neck/shoulder discomfort in that area as well.

Can cubital tunnel syndrome also cause numbness in the forearm? Is this a different nerve entrapment/issue?"

Three year old with reoccurring fever and vomiting. Two Dr visits and now an overnight hospital stay with no answers.,"Sorry if this is hard to read or missing details, it's been a long 24 hours with little sleep.

3 1/2 yo white male Alabama
This started 3 weeks ago Sept. 12th with a high fever of 103° a very runny nose and horrible cough. The Dr said he had an ear infection and congestion and put him on amoxicillin for 10 days, tylenol and motrin for fever as needed and dimetapp for cough as needed.

A few days after starting the amoxicillin the fever was gone and the coughing and runny nose was better but not gone. 

On the 10th-11th day (Sept. 23rd) after his first Dr visit he wakes up with a fever of 103° coughing horribly and vomiting. The Dr said he still had a little fluid in his ear and that drainage was causing the coughing and vomiting so we continue motrin and dimetapp for those symptoms as needed. Coughing and runny nose finally stopped a few days later. 

Yesterday morning Oct. 5th he wakes up again with a 103° fever, vomiting and complaining about his head hurting and tummy hurting. Gave him a dose of tylenol at 930am and decided to bring him to the ER at 1pm after his fever hadn't broke and vomiting persisted.

The ER did bloodwork and cultures last night around 9pm and his white blood cell count came back high at 31. They put him on IV fluids last night and his bloodwork done this morning came back at 19.

Now here's why I'm here. The pediatrician said that he has either caught 3 different viruses or a reoccurring virus that they can't test for and are going to release him in a few hours if he drinks some fluids. But, they said if his symptoms come back to take him to his family Dr and they can refer him to children's hospital where they can test for this reoccurring virus that apparently has no name."
Propranolol Side Effects?,"27F 115lbs, 5’3

Hi- I stared taking 10mg of propranolol a day yesterday for panic attacks. I take it in the mornings (9am). 

Yesterday I felt a bit woozy. I went to the store that afternoon (3 or 4pm) and got so dizzy that I thought I was having a panic attack (came home and sobbed). Then I saw that it may cause dizziness.

I decided to keep going today because the pharmacist said my body just needs to get used to it. About 2pm, I felt dizzy/nauseated. I feel tired but mostly just woozy. I have a little bit of chest tightness but not much else.

Can anyone tell me how long side effects last until I “adjust?”

I just want to know like at how many days should I give it up, or is this normal. 

I want to keep going forward because I could not possibly explain the severity of my panic attacks and I am desperate (and yes, I’ve tried SSRIs, neurofeedback, CBT, everything. ONLY Xanax has ever worked.)

-Had my wisdom teeth taken out last Christmas, so about 10 months since the operation. I recovered smoothly with no issues during recovery. 

I woke up this morning with what I thought was a bad canker sore inside my mouth, near the back right of my tongue. It hurts to talk, swallow, laugh, eat, drink, spit, move my tounge, and pretty much everything else. 

However, this pain is much worse than any canker sore I’ve ever had. The pain shoots down into my jaw and spreads out around the bottom right corner of my face whenever I swallow, or do anything else inside my mouth. Very very painful. Not throbbing, but quick, and sharp, like a needle. I took some Ibuprofen and it helped a bit, but it’s still very painful. I wonder if it’s some type of nerve exposure.

My [23F] Weird Tongue,"Hey everyone, first time posting here so hopefully I give enough info. I’m 5’3”, 127 pounds, white, and dont take any medication other than my birth control pills (Apri), one a day womens gummy vitamins and a biotin pill every day. I don’t smoke and I drink minimally; maybe 0-5 drinks per month. For maybe 3 months now, I’ve been having this spot on my tongue thats more red than the rest of my tongue. It’s not an open sore, it just doesnt seem to have the top layer of papillae (not sure if thats correct but thats my guess). Like over the course of the day your tongue gets a bit whiter or whatever, that spot will not. I was freaking out about it at first because when this first happened, I had just started taking a probiotic gummy. I went to the dentist and they told me to stop taking the probiotic gummy, so I did, and it started to get better so they didnt feel the need to address it again. It seems to come and go, but I didnt think it was geographic tongue because the spot is always in the same location. It doesnt hurt or cause me any pain but if I dont brush my teeth and tongue at night, in the morning when I do brush it, it may be a bit more sensitive but only enough for me to notice its there. I also have health anxiety so I’m trying not to let it affect me too much. Does anybody has an idea of what this could be, how I caused it, or if I can make it go away permanently? I can provide pictures if desired but I’m pretty self conscious about it so I figured I’d just start the post without them.

Frequently Almost Faint [18F],"So this has gone on for years but nobody’s been able to give me any answers so far.

At seemingly random times I almost faint, and the lead up feels really long. It starts with a feeling of lightheadedness, dizziness, a general uneasy feeling. Then my vision slowly goes as if a candle was burning out, followed quickly by a progressively louder high pitched noise in my ears. By the time I get myself to either sit or lay down I am completely blind and can’t hear anything but the high pitched noise and sometimes muffled voices, but I am hyper aware of my other senses. The one time I tried to just wait it out I did fully faint. 

The lead up seems to last 2-5minutes (but feels longer) and the time where I’m vulnerable and can’t see/hear ranges from a couple of seconds to the longest being 2 minutes.

No surgical history
No family history
Smoker
No allergies

Hello, I'll try to keep it concise and relevant.

The problem: I keep waking up fully wide awake and alert during the night, multiple times.

How it started: About 3 years ago, I went to sleep and after 5 hours of sleep, I woke up. The same thing happened next day until today.

I was on Lexapro when it happened but I have quit about a year ago. I sleep with a CPAP machine so it's not sleep apnea. I have been to a neurologist that specializes in sleep disorders but she has no idea why.

These last two months, I've been taking Seroquel (anti psychotic for schizophrenics) because it helps me maintain a little bit of sleep. I am not bipolar or schizophrenic.

I've been to cognitive behavior therapy. It helps with anxiety but not the sleep problem.

I've tried Xanax, it helps, but does not cure it.

I've tried doxylamine succinate, it helps, but does not cure it.

I've been having vivid dreams and nightmares ever since I went on Lexapro. I still see them on a daily basis. Also, I right before I wake up, something always scary or horrific happens in my dreams, like seeing spiders (I am terrified of them).

Every single day for the last 3 years, I have to literally struggle to get back to sleep and **I mean that with absolutely no exaggeration.**

I also suffer from something called Non-24 sleep-wake disorder which is a circadian rhythm but I've had this since teenagehood. I am now 29 yrs old. I've been to many doctors but no one could help me.

Is Meniere's Disease a terminal illness?,"im 18, hispanic, female, 5'3'', 115 lb,  and have had Meniere's for 2 years.

the condition is in both ears and is causing progressive loss of hair cells in my vestibular system. im having difficulty walking without aid and i have some hearing loss as well.

but recently i came across a paper saying that the hair cells of your vestibular system are responsible for detecting CO2 in your blood, and not the brainstem, which hence regulates autonomic breathing and the scientist who wrote this paper argued that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is caused by poor inner ear health and degradation of vestibular hair cells leads to 'Ondine's Curse' or fatal breathing irregularities. basically it is saying that i could hold my breath and not feel any ''urge'' to breathe and then die, or not wake up or breathe faster if say, i was having an asthma attack in my sleep.

is this true because i am really worried, as the degradation of vestibular hair cells continues will i have problems breathing or forget to breathe in my sleep and not wake up? or if i get sleep apnea i wont wake up because my body has no way of detecting CO2 once the hair cells in my ears are gone?"

I was still feeling sluggish the following Tuesday, so I checked my temperature and realized I was still mildly feverish (~99.5 F). I've checked my temperature every day since then, and my temperature has never gone below 99.1 F.

So this started maybe last march. I'm usually a pretty healthy person, but for a few weeks, I was super stressed and binged a lot of shitty food. One day I started feeling really weird after eating more than like a tiny portion of food. I'd feel super wired, restless and extremely anxious as if my body is unable to handle more than a small amount. I know it sounds strange, but this has been happening every time I eat since then. I basically feel like this all day unless I eat a small portion, which I feel a bit better, but no matter what I do, this never goes away.

This has been putting an enormous amount of stress on my body, and it's really affecting my health and lifestyle. I have no idea what the fuck is wrong, I'm in good shape physically, all the tests my doctor has done come back fine and she is confused too.

I’ve had them for the past 2 years. have been taking Prioslec (Omeprazole) for my GERD on and off the past 2 years (been continually taking it every morning the past 2 months). My GERD is mainly the silent type, where I sometimes get a tight chest and pain when I don’t take medication or have had a lot of trigger food. It’s gotten a lot better the past few months however, as I’ve gotten out of a stressful situation, am generally eating better and lost some weight. 

Anyway, onto my symptoms...I only ate about 400 calories total (pastries) yesterday, and since 3 PM have barely had any appetite (not feeling hungry) besides a few hunger pans. All I ate after the pastries was a banana and small piece of dried fruit, and still don’t feel super hungry. I’m not sure if this is due to the IBS, but I haven’t been having any flare ups the past few days which has been nice.

I also took some mints yesterday which have me a weird, ice cold feeling I’ve never had before in my throat. Then I started experiencing this weird feeling in my throat...a little bit of pain, but now how a sore throat usually feels. I don’t know if I’m imagining it, feel like there’s something inside the bottom or side of my throat. It’s not very prominent, but it definitely feels like there’s something there. I don’t have difficulty swallowing, or any soreness, but I feel something is there that I’ve never felt before. Not sure if this is due to the GERD, however.

Or if all this could be due to seasonal changes and allergies/cold symptoms, which I’ve of course experienced before.

Until now, 5th year in College, they're still there. I never had sex with my whole life, even oral. They have never been itchy or even irritating. They weren't painful either. I just suddenly noticed it one day and forget about it. I don't have complication with urinating or experienced any symptoms of genital herpes that I found online. I don't want to lean over self-diagnosing so please, help me know what these are.

I am too afraid to go out to see doctors. My social anxiousness is really taking a huge toll on me. Right now, I am having a hard time breathing by just thinking about it.

I hope you could help me out with this one. I am too afraid to open up this with my parents since they might think I've been having sex with strangers during my college life. Please help.

This is my last resort. Thank you in advance.

Scared of ALS,"Hello there im a 31 year old female 5’6” weight about 190 medical history just acid reflux and gastritis recently. I have been struggling with random muscle twitching for almost a month. They are mostly all over the body but concentrated a lot in the lower half both sides usually very small twitches when I’m at rest mostly not when I’m busy doing other things. They almost feel as if someone is touching me quickly or like a feather running down my skin i usually do not see them only feel them.  Anyways never noticed any kind of muscle weakness which has been keeping my anxiety at bay about the twitching for the most part I am still able to do everything. A friend of mine who is a NP did my reflexes for me and only
Noted a slightly brisk knee jerk she said she would give it a 2 1/2 or 3 but when she repeated it multiple times at my insistence they were normal again. All other reflexes normal except she was having a hard time eliciting my left tricep reflex. I’ll note she did not do Babinski or Hoffman just basic reflexes. however I’m kind of freaking out as  last night I was sitting down and had my knee bent with my foot on top of the other knee and I flexed my foot and toes up and just noticed that when I do that with my left leg up and flex the calf muscle gets hard and firm however when I do the same with the right it’s not quite as hard and firm and i have to work harder to make the muscle stick out. I’ll add that I did notice that when standing up on my toes both calf muscles are equally hard. Is this my first sign of muscle weakness? Maybe a muscle in my foot or ankle is slowly wasting making it harder to flex my calf muscle? Maybe it’s only a small muscle wasting and the other ones are compensating allowing me to still do things? Any insights appreciated"
Extreme Fatigue from Chantix?,"34 yr old white f, 5'7"", 123 lbs. Experiencing fatigue for about 2 weeks. Currently taking Chantix, Suboxone, movantik, daily vitamins, collegian, ibprofen, depo shot. Past diagnosis- scoliosis, degenerative disc disease, arthritis, most recent HLA-B27

Recently I have been suffering from extreme fatigue. I'll sleep at night from 9-5, then get up for work with 0 motivation to do anything! On days off, I will sleep until almost noon, then feel tired enough to take a nap around 3 pm, and still sleep at my usual 9pm that same night. I'm on day 12 or 13 of Chantix. Could this be a side effect of the medication? If so, is there anything I can do besides stop taking it? I've had similar bouts of fatigue in the past. Just lead to being HLA-B27 positive and low on vitamin D. My daily vitamin has vitamin D in it, but maybe not enough?? When I'm not going through these bouts of fatigue, I'm usually very productive. Work/run a full time business, do 90% of household chores, run errands ECT. When I get these ""spells"" of fatigue, they last from a few days to a few months and I have barely any energy to even shower! I don't feel depressed, sad, angry, just weak and hard to walk for long periods of time. Any advice of input is appreciated.

Dont know if this is concerning?,"I'm a 15 year old female that is 128LBS and around 5'1"" and I've been feeling I think sweat from my armpit area drip down my arms and down my sides, even when I'm cold.

"Could I be intersex/have been subjected to forcible genital correction? (26, FTM)","I’m looking to find out more info about intersex conditions because I think I might be intersex. Not sure how trans-positive this sub is but would prefer anatomical terms be used rather than things like ""female anatomy,"" more for the sake of my own sanity than anything else. I use he/him pronouns, please don't respond if you're going to be an asshole, I'm coming off extreme abuse from my community for being transgender and now I'm dealing with this shit as well.

Background: 
26, female-to-male transgender, from insular religious community. Didn’t see docs much growing up, but have some vague memories of being sent away to my grandparents’ house and going to doctor’s appts there. Also vague memories of genital examinations from docs as a small child, which I’m given to understand is not super typical for little girls. Was taught not to touch/look at my genitalia, started my period kind of late and it was extremely irregular. I didn’t really know until yesterday that it was unusual to have never seen a gyno at my age...sex talk was always very taboo and my parents never mentioned needing to see one. 

The big thing though is that I have (what feels like) genital scarring that’s very symmetrical. 
- There’s scarring in a Y shape between my clitoris and vaginal opening. It feels rough and is fairly painful. I always assumed that MOST ppl had some kind of similar vaginal seam but apparently not. 

- there are scars between my labia minora and majora which look like suture marks, and the skin on either side of them looks VERY different in a straight line along the scars. 

- my urethral opening is COMPLETELY invisible when looking at my vulva, and is basically completely inside of my vagina. It's extremely difficult to see, and also looks fucked up. There are symmetrical sets of scarring on either side, each two parallel lines. It's hard to tell, but it looks as if there are also (not sure of the correct medical terminology) holes where the scars meet the urethral opening, but also the urethral opening looks so jacked up (jacked up is the technical term, I'm sure) and different from any anatomical drawings I can find that it's hard to distinguish.

(Other notes: 
-yes, I AM on testosterone, but the scarring predates this. I've been told believing you're intersex is a common trans experience, so I've never sought out medical advice on this because I thought I was crazy.
-I got my period, but it was always very irregular. Also a reason I never sought medical treatment, because I was told that would be impossible for any with intersex conditions.
-I wondered if the strange urethral placement might have to do with clitoral growth from testosterone, but to be honest, I also remember comparing anatomical drawings to what I was working with BEFORE hormones and thinking, ""this isn't right, I don't see a urethral opening anywhere….""
-It's hard to tell whether there's any scarring around the vaginal opening, but penetration has always been fairly painful, even initially with something as small as a tampon.)"
Pink patch on my right testicle,"18M here Asian male
My testicles are usually brown in colour but recently for the past few months I've been getting into a bad habit of scratching my right testicle a lot (sometimes it bleeds).

Occasionally it is flakey aswell.
Recently I've let it heal and now there's a pink patch on my right testicle (been like this for around 2 weeks).

I'm not sure if this is a loss of pigmentation or whether the surface of the skin of my right testicle has been peeled off or something....the pink pack feels similar to the rest of my balls just slightly smoother.

I'm getting quite worried though.
I'm not comfortable posting a pic directly in the subreddit but if anyone offers me help I will pm.
Many thanks."

My shoulder has had pain for 6 months. It’s off and on. Maybe 2 weeks hurting, 2-4 weeks not hurting. I used to lift and I took a break, then when I thought it healed, would start lifting again. It would start hurting maybe 2-3 weeks after I started lifting. The odd thing is the pain moves. One day it’s on my shoulder, then it might move to the top of my shoulder blade, then to the inside of my shoulder blade, then on top of my shoulder where the trap meets the shoulder. I do have some knots “under” my shoulder blade. They may be pinching some nerves, but I’m not sure if that would cause the random pain movements that I’m having"
Chest Pain/Esophagus Pain - Increases when Eating or Drinking,"Hi Everyone,

I have a doctor's appointment scheduled for Wednesday for the doctor on call in my building. Not a specialist, but wanted to go there before going to someone more extreme.

I am a 23 year old female with no other known health issues (dealing with some back muscle issues but do not see how that could be related)

I currently feel pressure/pain in the middle of my chest. This is the most painful when I drink water, and second most painful to eat (especially cracker like foods, ice cream is less painful), and third breathing deeply/yawning, but I always feel the pressure throughout the day. I feel a sharp pain when I do those above activities and sometimes just when breathing but mostly it's duller if just sitting.

It started on Sunday, September 29th I woke up with what felt like heartburn (sharper pain). It continued throughout the day with pretty strong pain. The pain has been less since then, but definitely still present.

Does anyone have any idea what this could be, what caused it, or what I could do to get rid of it.

Happy to answer any additional questions - plan to be checking this frequently as this is very top of mind. Appreciate any insights - thanks!"
(NSFW) heart pauses every 3 beats after sexual activity?,"Age: 21

Okay so I wanna start off with saying that I have posted here before... According to heart exams everything is fine and normal so why is this happening?!

After I engaged in sexual activity I noticed my chest aching and I could feel my pulse (I suffer from bounding pulse for quite some time)

I wasn't sure if to trust what I feel so I checked my pulse through the wrist and it went like 3 rapid beats then a long 1 sec pause then one beat. The same pattern over and over again for about 5 mins after reaching climax... My pulse then becomes normal again... Why is this happening? Could this be hormones causing this? 

Should I be worried?"
Mini-seizures or just chills?,"Age: 17
Sex: Female
Height: 4’11”
Weight: 95 lbs

Complaint: Shivers with deja vous feeling and nose running/sneezing
Location: Whole body? Brain?
Duration: My whole life, but more severe/frequent within the past several weeks
Medications: None
Recreational drugs/alcohol: A little marijuana here and there (very infrequent use)

My whole life, I’ve gotten these small fits about once or twice per day where I have deja vous, have a brief, uncontrollable shiver, then sneeze several times and have a runny nose for a few minutes afterwards. My mom and several other family members also get them. But in the past few weeks, I’ve started getting this episodes WAY more often—like 1-2 times per hour (although sometimes more) instead of 1-2 times per day.  Should I be worried about this?"
Possibly CSF leak?,"So, for the past few years I've had a host of neurological problems, primarily focused around my neck and face. It's not debilitating, but it's constantly bothersome. I'll start with a list:

Forehead tingling

Neck stiffness, clicking, and pain 

Pressure around the top of neck and bottom of skull (comes and goes) 

Arm tingling and radiculopathy that comes and goes

Tinnitus 

Strange rhythmic clicking in my throat 

Clicking sounds in my ears sometimes when lying down

Occasional hyperacusis symptoms

Visual snow and floaters

I've had various MRIs, all of which have shown little more than some mild nerve impingement that I've been told are insignificant. 

In the past few months, I've started to experience an occasional clear leakage from my nostrils. I can make it happen by leaning forward, but it doesn't really leak out of my nose so much as I can feel it begin to run in that direction. There's never much of it, and it only rarely happens without me leaning. I've read that CSF leaks usually only come from one nostril (mine is both), but I've also read that getting a runny nose from leaning forward is a good sign it's a leak. 

I don't get much in the way of headaches, though I do get head fullness and dizziness upon standing sometimes, but that's happened since I was in my teens (now 32, male). 

The general symptom list all seems to (mostly) check out besides the severe leakage, and after so many years of seeking a diagnosis for all of this, I'm admittedly anxious to find something. So, I'm just checking the boxes, I guess. I would assume I'd have more severe leakage and headaches if it was a CSF leak, but it doesn't hurt to see if anyone could give me some opinions. 

Thanks in advance."

Experiencing lateral column pain in my right foot after running that won't seem to go away. Looking for some insight on what it could be?,"Hello!

I do have an appointment coming up for this but wanted to get some insight on it here too.

I am a 26 y/o Female and not currently taking any medications. I'm very active, usually lift full body 3x per week, do some sort of cardio 2x per week, and rest 2x per week. I stretch after most workouts and am very cautious about warm ups as I have had a hip injury in the past that has since been resolved with physical therapy/strength training.

I'll start off by saying I am not someone who runs often, but like to on occasion along with my lifting routine. One day about two weeks ago, I decided to go for a quick run (around 2 miles) in my new neighborhood. Everything was fine, but I admittedly was wearing old shoes while I waiting for my new running shoes to come in which I think is what lead to the problem of course.

The next day I went to the gym in the morning as normal and did a full body lifting session as normal, felt no pain in my feet during the workout whatsoever, and then after my workout as I was walking to my office the ball of my foot started to hurt. I chalked it up as wearing crappy shoes the previous day while running and that it would subside (I was also wearing flat sandals that day and had been for weeks because of the summer weather but never had an issue with wearing flat shoes before). Then over the next few days, the pain moved into [this area shown here](https://i.imgur.com/eHWMAId.jpg) specifically but more toward the back and has been there ever since.

I took this entire week off of the gym to see if it would help, but everytime I stand on my foot for too long or walk for a decent length of time, it starts to bother me again. Sometimes it hurts worse than other times. It only seems to bother me with activity/after activity and when I put pressure on it. If I pronate my foot, the pain goes away. It doesn't bother me in the morning at all (like plantar fascitis might), and if I press hard on that area of my foot with my fingers, it does re-create the pain. It does require A LOT of pressure to feel the pain, though. I have to be standing on it or pressing hard on the area.

**TLDR;** Pain in [this area shown here](https://i.imgur.com/eHWMAId.jpg) specifically only while putting a lot of pressure on the area (mostly exacerbated by long walks/standing). Pronating my foot does ease the pain. Concluded it was due to running with bad shoes since I am not someone who runs often/probably don't have the greatest running form.

The best way I can describe the pain would be almost like DOMS or a muscle spasm when it does hurt. Any idea what may be casing this?"
Armpit hair patchiness and thinning that comes and goes,"Armpit hair thinning that comes and goes

Hello! 
I am a 24 yo female student. I have been experiencing this issue on and off for the last 3 years. My armpit hair is usually pretty thick and brown, if I don’t shave it every 3 days.... it’s a lot. 
Over the last month, I noticed that my underarm hair is growing in much thinner. It’s not as bad as it has been in the past but it’s noticeably thinner. I will attach an image to show you. There are bald spots and all over you can kind of see where the hair follicles are, but there is nothing growing out of them. In this picture I haven’t shaved my underarms in like... a week ish. Normally my armpits have high density of hair growth and are not patchy at all. Normally there are 2 to 3 hairs growing out of every follicle (which you can still see around the middle of my armpit) [armpit pic](https://imgur.com/a/eauyqEg)

My health history is as follows: sports induced bronchospasm, IBS, lichen sclerosus (experiencing a flare atm) and migraine. 
 
Is it possible that this is a form of allopecia that I’m lucky enough to have only in my armpits. 

In the past I’ve lost almost all of it and I went to a walk in because I didn’t have a family doc. He did some basic bloodwork, told me he didn’t know, and then suggested it was PCOS. (Which imo is silly because I have no symptoms of pcos."

My chest vibrates and roars sometimes,"I don't know if posting this here is the right thing for me to do, but I have nowhere else to go and I just want to know what is causing this.

Background: I'm an eighteen year old female with cerebral palsy. The cp only affects my legs, but it may be a reason why my chest does this, I dont know. Anyway, my chest has been making noises and vibrating pretty much my entire life. According to my mom, when I was a baby it happened maybe once or twice a month, but as I grew older it's happened a lot more frequently.

My chest literally vibrates. If I put my hand on my chest while it's happening I can feel it. It also makes this roaring sound  while it vibrates, like my stomach is growling but it's in my chest.

Sometimes when I get really stressed my chest will hurt a lot, like it's tight, and the only way to make it go away is if it roars. Sometimes that doesn't work though and the pain is still there. This also happens when I am about to get sick, or I get too excited.

I've mentioned it to my doctor, and my aunt who was a nurse, and they don't know what it could actually be. My aunt wondered if it was a hernia in my chest, and my doc said it might have something to do with my diaphragm but it's not certain.

I just want to put a name, or maybe a diagnosis, to this phenomenon, and I maybe I can mention it to my doctor... but I'm asking you guys because I dont know what to do.

But it happens even occasionally when I dont shower for a few days like when I go camping or something. I'm 27 now and have even tried to go to a few ENT's as an adult to try and figure it out. I feel sinus pressure alot as well. It's not a huge deal and I can live with it, but it's more of a curiosity thing at this point just to see what's causing it.

Hey, 
This question might seem super stupid but I've been wondering about this for a while now, and I can't understand whether I have enlarged lymph nodes under jaw or those are not lymph nodes at all. 
Are there muscles that are located symmetrically under the corners of your jaw? If I press the base of my tongue down (you know like you'd do to make your chins hide for a photo) then I can clearly feel two big symmetrical olive like things, pretty much right under the jaw if I trace it with my finger down the neck a centimeter from where the jaw ends. They're quite soft unless I squeeze my muscles hard. 

If I don't press my tongue down and relax my muscles then I can barely feel them and they become flatter but not smaller."

Had one of the worst nights sleep of my life. I didn't even sleep. I wanted to call the emergency doctor open 24/7 but my mom wouldn't let me as she does't believe the pain i'm in and thinks i'm making it up, same with my dad. I dont know how i can show them that it really does hurt. Am i supposed to drop dead on the floor for to realize? All night i just layed in bed upright all night. Each time i layed down, i felt like something was coming up so i sat back up again and would belch 5 times in a row and it really hurt my chest (water helped the belch come up so i was going to the bathroom alot last night too.) every time i belch, the taste in my mouth is disgusting. I was also very nauseous and was so terrified to puke (a huge phobia of mine is puking) If i can't burp, then how am i going to get puke up? And if i did puke, it would be a hard painful puke and would hurt my chest. I've been having alot of chest pains especially today, it's a dull pain but very uncomfortable and worrisome. I also have a pain in my throat above my collarbone where it feels like i have a lump and i'm constantly swallowing. I'm starting to get a sore throat too. And the heartburn is just non stop, it burns but it feels cold..if that makes any sense, all around my chest. On top of all this, ive had a upper back pain for the past few days aswell, right shoulder blade area. Feels like a knot and the pain is radiating into my head and makes the back of my skull feel like it's being squeezed tightly. Oh not to mention, i haven't ate proper food in about 5 days since this alll began. I can't tell if i'm hungry or the burning sensation in my stomach is the acid. And i'm too scared to eat incase i puke cos of my phobia to puke. Anytime i try to eat, i just get extremely nausea and can't finish. Not even soup or toast. I'm also very cold constantly and get very shakey but i'll get sweaty hands and feet. 

Fyi: I've been to the doctor about this and he checked my back and said it was probably pinched nerve and told him that i'm having symptoms of acid reflux. He prescribed me a painkiller for my back called Tramadol 340mg l, took one on the first night and made feel very spaced out and weird. I hated it so i refuse to take it. Heat patches seem to help and just regular paracetamol. Also prescribed me a gastro tablet called Pantium 40mg (Irish brand as i'm in Ireland), they don't seem to be do anything so i've resorted to taking Nexium and Gaviscon. These past few days have been rough and scary, i've cried and moaned to my parents to bring me to the ER or call the 24/7 doctor because ive been so scared. I have a doctors appointment again tomorrow at 7 pm so hopefully i can chat to him about everything and see what can be done. I'm hoping to get a scan or endoscopy just to make sure everything is okay. I can't go another day without sleeping or eating."
Is it possible to lower blood pressure naturally? Would losing extra weight help?,"Hi. Hope you're well! 24F here. I'm a bit overweight atm, I currently weigh 170 lbs, which is 40 lbs above my normal weight.

Height:  6'

So, I've been overweight almost my whole life and it wasn't really a problem for me. I have a great support system of friends and I'm on my weight loss journey (I was around 330lbs at my heaviest) by a combination of powerlifting and keto diet.

My main problem is that I don't think I've ever gone through puberty, my voice hasn't changed, my balls haven't dropped that much and my penis hasn't grown. I do have a beard which is why I've been sceptical about posting this question for a long time. Also, I don't remember a time when I was very horny, masturbating non stop, etc as is generally described as the puberty phase.

I'm very conscious about my penis length and it has been a source of major confidence issues for a long time now. It was actually the main reason for my motivation to loose weight and even after loosing a considerable amount, I'm not really seeing much difference. I have legit turned down hookups due to being insecure about my penis. And this is something I can't really talk with anyone.

So my question is, is it possible that I haven't gone through puberty? And if that is the case, what are my options? And even if not, what more could I do to take care of my issues?

Hello I’m 17 with adhd borderline suicide from social anxiety,"I am a 17 year old with a severe case of adhd.

I’m crying in my room rn seeing nobody no friends no girlfriend and no experience to show for my high school experience. I have two questions.
1. What was this medicine

Having issues with penis/foreskin and testicle pain,"Hello,

I believe I have phimosis.  I've had it for a very long time and I assumed it was just pain because I have foreskin and there wasn't anything to do about it, so I instructed my partners to be gentle. I recently heard about phimosis and want to explore my options but I don't even know where to start.
Based on the descriptions I think it could be classified as grade 2-3?

I also have had right testicular pain that will linger, and get worse if its touched for about a year I'd guess.  I did get it checked last winter and got an ultrasound that came up clean.  I went to a urologist and they just said to take light painkillers like ibuprofen or whatever I prefer whenever it was an issue, but that hasn't helped in the past and didn't help and I haven't made it back in so partially my fault.  I don't know if it's the actual testicle or maybe the epididymis just based on when I have the pain and I'm prodding with my fingers.  It seems to hurt a lot more when I touch where they connect.  I also have lower back pain on my right side that seems to always hurt at the same time.  The dr. did not know that at the time because I didn't know it might be relevant and I don't think they asked, but looking into it more myself I think it might be relevant.  The combination of these two have kind of killed my desire to have sex because we have to be very gentle and it contributed to a relationship ending.

I'm sure you will have questions so fire away, I'll be watching football all day.
I really appreciate any help or advice you can provide.

Pins and needles style pain in lower spine?,"Sex: FTM trans
Age: 19
Weight: Not sure
Height: 4'9

Medical history: Spina Bifia Occulta, Asthma
Medications: Co-codamol (only as needed)
Duration: Several years

So occasionally I get a pain shoot straight up through the base of my spine and through my hips. The best way I can describe it is pins and needles but excruciatingly painful. It lasts for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes and it's so bad that I can't move until it ends.

Finger laceration with numbness at scar/wound site.,"Who am I: 31, Male, No existing medical trauma or issue, 155 lbs. 5'6"".

Story and context:
On August 25th 2019, I sustained a severe laceration at work.  I was handling glass and recklessly didn't wear safety gloves.  My finger pierced a sharp piece of glass almost directly to the fingerprint (possibly at a 45 degree angle) and along the left side of the right index finger.

I waited several hours before going into the ER. I was lucky to get treated fairly fast, as the operating doctor told me I hit an artery (if I remember correctly, I'm not too sure).  I obviously didn't loose any major function or hit any tendons as I have grip strength and can flex it properly so I feel lucky in that regard.

The issue:
I have no trouble feeling textures, heat, cold, or other sensations but feeling is slightly muted where the scar tissue resides on the fingerprint area and in its place is the raised bump of scar tissue.  I strongly believe the scar tissue is preventing nerves from regenerating properly within the site, but I just wanted to get other perspectives on this.  

It's been one month and nearly two weeks since my accident.  I'm aware I have a long way to go before it'll heal properly  but I just want to know what my prospects are.  I don't really care about scars, or a loss of strength in the finger.  The lack of sensation in my right index finger is just such a psychological problem that I'm worried will always follow me in life due to the fact that I'm right handed and use my hands for nearly everything. 

I did see my doctor twice and a walk in clinic.  Walk in clinic said it's a very minor cut and that it'll go away but the scar tissue will always be there and maybe get smaller.  My main doctor basically said that I will have a full recovery but I only realized at the end of that day, after feeling my finger, that I noticed this numb sensation.

Included pictures for reference.

TLDR: laceration of right index finger about a month ago, regained sensation, missing very minimal sensation (like less than 5% of sensitivity) on scar tissue area on fingerprint when rubbing it on my thumb."
Here 26F looking for advice before going to the doctor,"Hey! How are you all doing?

I'm from Uruguay and my native language it's Spanish, so if I make some spelling mistakes, I apologize in advance.

For the requirements: I'm 26 years old, I had conversive crisis/syndrome (I don't know how you say it in English), I'm 5'5 and I don't know how much I weight but I think I'm good for my stature, finally I've been off my meds for almost a year now except for diazepam and I haven't had a crisis for a complete year. 

Here's the deal, I've been having some problems when I need to talk. I'm 26, and I never had a problem with my speech, but lately I can't form words correctly, I forget them, sometimes I think in english so I try to translate them when I'm talking to someone but sometimes I can't so I speak spanglish or I make up words 'cause I can't remember the real ones... 

At first it started like minor mistakes, but now I can't really have a full conversation without forgetting words or making words up or talking spanglish.

Today my mom said I should to start reading in Spanish again 'cause it seemed that I'm losing my vocabulary, but the thing that she doesn't know is that I'm having trouble with English too, I can't watch series or movies without subtitles anymore 'cause I can't understand some of the words that were really easy to understand before... I try to put English subtitles so I don't lose the language, but yeah.

You may think ""if she's having that problem, how is she writing all of this and in a second language?"" Answer: I had time to think, process and correct what I'm writing and I have autocorrect on.

To go ahead and clear some things out, I don't do drugs, nor drink alcohol, nor smoke.

I'm just worried, should I go to the doctor?

"Dizziness, disorientation, confusion","Age: 60F

Height: 4' 10""

Race: Caucasian

Weight: 240 lb

Complaint: Dizziness, disorientation, confusion following head injuries, also have Lyme

Duration: since 2015

Existing medical issues: Post-concussion syndrome?, Lyme , Depression, Anxiety

Medications: Lexapro 20mg, Clonopin .5 mg

Using a throwaway. To expand on the title - I had a horse riding accident in May, 2015 ... was wearing a helmet but hit the ground pretty hard with my face. Folks said I didn't lose consciousness, but I don't remember the minutes from just before the fall until I hit the ground. Accident resulted in broken wrist and ""concussion without loss of consciousness."" Following that, I was having some neurological trouble - one symptom of which was poor reflexes. After handling horses for 50 years, in Feb. 2016, one reared up and kicked me along the right side of my head as he came down. That was followed by an Xray of my head. Shortly after, looking for the reasons for my neuro symptoms (I also was feeling like I was walking like a toddler, and walking down the road, I'd feel like I was on an angle) I was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I was on antibiotics for about 2 years, with 2 different LLMDs (Lyme docs.)

&#x200B;

Since then I've seen specialists at a regional teaching university including:

* endocrinologist (high PTH & Calcium, but hyperparathyroidism ruled out w/sestamibi scan),
* cardiology (I have a heart murmur, the cause of which is unknown after ekg, echo, stress test, ecg),
* Otolyryngology (VNG),
* Sleep Study (positive for apnea, but I've used CPAP successfully in the past until I became too dehydrated with it, even with humidifier - several different models - insurance won't pay if you don't wear it for 4 hours and I can't risk a fight with ins right now),
* Neurology (prescribed Clonopin, which I am taking. Refuses to order MRI because I had one after my fall, in 2016. Kind of weird - a nurse back then told me to have someone else look at the MRI results, but no one I've said that to has done anything about it.)

&#x200B;

Also, I've had several head injuries throughout my life. One family member thinks I might have CTE. I contacted the concussion institute at BU. I will be donating my brain following my death. But I think, if anything, it's more like TBI than CTE, after reading symptoms

&#x200B;

I used to be pretty insistent, a good self-advocate, not intimidated, but not unkind. But I've given up. I'm waiting for partial disability (SSDI) to come - I've been preliminarily approved. I'm not having any other medical tests - i.e. mammo - because I want to die. I love my family, my work and until 2 years ago, my horses. My horses are now gone, I can only do very little work (my own biz) before I am too dizzy and exhausted. My family, except for one very kind grown daughter, doesn't have time or doesn't care. I can no longer babysit my grandkids.

&#x200B;

My body hurts all the time. I mostly do handcrafts, sit on the couch and stream media, which I NEVER used to do. My DXs for disability are Lyme, post-concussion syndrome, and now, depression and anxiety. I've lost my identity and my dignity.

&#x200B;

I am on .5 Clonopin and 20mg Lexapro (the Lexapro for years now) and go to therapy weekly. He knows I want to die. I don't own guns. I live alone, rurally, with dogs. Tonight my left ear feels like it's filled with water. Occasionally, in recent history, when I put a finger in it to scratch an itch or remove wax, it's painful. Some nights my right ear and right side of my head, where I got kicked, is painful. I get headaches many mornings (which I attributed to apnea) and evenings. I take Extra Strength Tylenol. The neurologist prescribed 1 mg Hydroxyzine for headaches, every 8 hours as needed. But when I take 1mg it knocks me out for 24 hours. I've only taken it twice.

&#x200B;

There must be SOME testing for my vestibular system, if that's what's going on, other than VNG, which the specialist reminds me I've had every time I ask about vestibular. Or to someone else for MRI of my head? I tried taking blood pressure sitting vs standing for a few days thinking POTS. It does rise, but only to about 150/80. Normal is @120/70.

&#x200B;

I had gastric bypass surgery in 2009, lost 70 lbs, now, at 4'10"" back up to about 240. Another reason to be done with this life. I just feel though, that if someone could fix my head symptoms, I might be able to do the rest of the work to get healthy. I've always been heavy, but otherwise strong and healthy.

&#x200B;

I almost always feel dehydrated, but docs claim they tested for it and I'm not. I've asked them to just let me have a saline bag at the hospital or in the office to see how I feel after but no dice.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any ideas for me, I'd like to hear. Some folks say it's all Lyme. And each one has an idea for treatment. (I've tested negative for co-infections.) .

TL;DR I've had neuro symptoms for years. I've gone to specialists and had testing. No answers.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I also have pain in the right side of my throat sometimes. Also, trouble concentrating (I don't read novels or long articles anymore.) Plus, I am impatient with people, and mostly stay home. I also can't tolerate lights and noise."
Question about my testicle,"I am 16 years old and a year ago I had a testicular torsion so I had my right testicle removed. To my awareness they re-stitched my left one so it doesn't happen again.

Should I be worried about this? Thanks"

"My mom [48F][5', non-smoker caucasian, 120 lbs(?)] has a bad birthmark due to KTS. It had a new symptom this morning and we're not sure why or how bad it is.","Hey Docs! So, my mom is an entrepreneur at 48 and she had a big order that had to have a 1-day turnaround. She pulled an all-nighter getting it done, which meant a lot of standing. She makes custom apparel, so this meant a lot of moving short distances in her work room from noon till 5:40 AM with sparse breaks. She has a chair but doesn't have the luxury of using it for long when she's working. She also frequently operated her heat press, where she reaches up to the handle and has to really pull down to use. She's 5' nothing, so she has to reach up a little over her head and pull it down (to my best guess) chest-level. She has never smoked, she's a vegetarian since '90, and has semi-frequent beer or wine but nothing excessive.

Her birthmark flares up during work-intensive nights like this. She has Kleppel-Trenauney-Webber (aka Kleppel-Trenauney) Syndrome (KTS).

\##So, about that birthmark;

it’s fist-sized in the front of her right calf, by the ankle. It now resembles a chronically freshly-scraped knee because it “started itching at pregnancy” and she has a very bad habit of scratching. Poor thing hasn’t had a chance to really heal until about last year, when she really applied herself to stopping. TL:DR, 19 years of scratching at her ankle has messed it up.

\##So what’s different about her standard state of life these days compared to the rest of us?

Her ankle is super sensitive to pressure, as one would expect. It’s basically a section of exposed nerves. It also ‘feels like a burn’. Her right leg is also measurably larger; she got a surgery at 16-ish to stunt its growth. In the past few years, her foot’s been swelled like it was stung by a bee. A recent dermatologist appointment showed it’s collecting blood and can’t transport it out effectively. She says it feels weird but she can sometimes squeeze and push blood back up. If it matters, she has arthritis in both knees.

\##This morning:

Symptoms:

\- this morning, the pain was very intense (electric shock flares) which prevented sleep for an hour

\- right foot and leg, not just ankle birthmark, hurt in a radius (ish)

\- mom suspects a blood clot

Is this temporary? Will she recover by not pulling all-nighters? Below I’ll post what else she does to treat her ankle.

\##Regular treatment:

\- Sleep with leg raised

\- Apply Vaseline and some other salve, this one by prescription. She's been on it long enough that I seriously doubt it's a side effect.

\- cover with gauze that is regularly changed

\- sit with leg on a stool or something to keep it higher up

I've been having regular loose stools for the past 3 weeks along with sudden urges to use the toilet, my diet has been quite poor for a long time due to a mixture of laziness and long working hours but I'm in no way overweight, I regularly drank 3 cans of soda a day before cutting it out entirely 2 weeks ago believing this may have been the route cause but it's had virtually no effect on my bowel movements.

I have severe period pain. My doctor won’t give me real pain medicine.,"I’m a 20 yr old female. I take antidepressant Wellbutrin and vistiril for anti anxiety at night. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I’m very active and am fairly healthy overall. No medical issues aside from whatever listed. I did have a history of migraine but haven’t had any for a long time. 

My periods have gotten worse and wide overtime. For a while they only lasted three days but they would be insanely heavy and excruciatingly painful. Not just cramps but this painful burning sensation in the abdomen as well as a hot feeling coming over my body occasionally and pain shooting down my legs and all over my back and neck. 

I went on a hormonal birth control for a short period of time. Two different hormonal pills at two different times. Both times the pills made me crazy. I was hormonal and acted nothing like myself. 

Because of how I am with hormones I decided I needed an iud. The only non hormonal iud is copper. The doctor warned me of the pain that may accompany the iud. 

My pain isn’t anything different or more special than before. It’s not even all the time. But when I do have it it’s still so debilitating. I have so much to get done and all I want is REAL pain meds. I’m not concerned about dependency as the pain is only one or two days out of the month. But I don’t know how to get through to my doctor. Neither my doctor or gynecologist are of any help. 

I’m willing to try medical marijuana but that’s another story. 

How do I get something besides a “higher dose of Naproxen Sodium”. Or acetaminophen. None of these things work and it’s like a big joke when my doctor asks if I’ve tried. 

What do I say to get what I need. I’m not a druggy for gods sake the pain is killing me let me work and get stuff done on the days my body is fighting me."
Taking Gaviscon and antacids. Minimum period of time?,"41m smoker with gastritis, and anaemia.

Here is my problem.

I take lanzoprazole twice a day, and am supposed currently to take Gaviscon four times a day.

Last week I was prescribed ferrous sulphate for anaemia and told to take it when eating to minimise chances of digestive upset.

My girlfriend [30F] has been peeing almost non-stop for days and I'm getting scared for her.,"Female, 30, white, about 5'7"" 170lbs. Non-smoker. Medications: Birth control pill, antibiotics. Area of concern: Urinary tract/possible reproductive health?

A little over a week ago she started experiencing back pain that also felt like occasional sharp stabbing pains in her stomach. While manageable, the pain made her feel nauseous while eating sometimes so she wasn't eating a ton. We went to a walk-in clinic last Thursday and they ran a urine test to determine if there was a UTI. The tests didn't show enough white blood cells to definitively confirm infection, but she started a five day round of antibiotics just in case.

Sometime either late Monday or early Tuesday she started feeling the constant urge to pee. She went to the ER and they ran another urine test. This time it came back negative for any sign of infection, however they did determine that she has bacterial vaginosis. The doctors at the hospital told her it wasn't anything to worry about and didn't treat it. They told her to wait a few days and if her symptoms were still presenting to come back and they'd write her a referral to a urologist.

On Wednesday she went back to the walk-in clinic because they told her to come by once she finished her first round of antibiotics if she was still experiencing symptoms. She gave them all of the paperwork from the hospital showing that she'd tested negative for UTIs and STIs but did have BV. They said it was definitely worth treating and gave her a new week-long round of stronger antibiotics.

Her urgency calmed down a little to the point where she was only feeling the urge every 45-75 minutes for a couple of days, but since last night it's gotten quite back again. She didn't sleep at all and has been going to the bathroom every 20 minutes or so. Her flow of urine occasionally has a hard time starting and often times is quite small. She hasn't presented a fever at any point during this time. She's also lost six pounds since Monday, which she attributes to the fact that she feels too nauseous to eat much.

We're starting to get frustrated that no one has decided to run any kind of imaging on her to determine if there are kidney stones or some other physical cause of this. One doctor mentioned that it could be Interstitial Cystitis and that has her quite worried at the concept of this just becoming a chronic illness that she had to live with now.

The weight loss is what concerns me the most. I'm afraid it's something serious that is going untreated. 

If we go to urgent care today, is there any reasonable expectation that they'd call for imaging to be done? What can we do?

Thank you."

I've been having really bad body aches lately when I wake up in the morning and it lingers on for a while. I was supposed to see my rhetumatologist that I stopped seeing after a couple years because I wasn't having symtpoms and decided it wasn't needed to get blood work every 5 months or so. But I started getting body aches a lot more and my issue with the cold weather and cold air in general really hurt my arms and legs. It's pretty painful. I was referred by my then primary physician years ago for suspected Lupus because of my blood work and symptoms I was having. I was supposed to get blood work done but the day I went the clinic closed down and their were cops there so I don't know what happened. Still trying to find a rheumatologist, that will see me soon. If not, I'll just schedule one in December or January. I have had lots of blood work done in the past. Am I at risk of developing mixed connective tissue disease? Last time I went to the specialist was 2-3 years ago and she recommended taking Prednisone but I decided not to or some kind of blood pressure medication. I thought it was too extreme because my symptoms weren't that bad. Thought she was making up things for me to take medication. Anyway, could she have been right in the past when she told me Im leaning towards having or developing mctd? Another thing I forgot to mention is any time I take something cold out from the fridge or freezer it hurts really bad bad my finger tips turn white or really red. 

I have some pictures of my lab reports from the last time I saw the rheumatologist which was in 2017. Here are the links. Please let me know your opinion as well as advice on what I should be doing. Thank you.

[23F] Losing weight too fast?,"So, just to be clear about the sex, im a trans woman who has been on hormobes for about 3 months.

Anyway, about 7 weeks ago the semester started at my school. Since then I have been losing about 3 pounds a week. Online it says that healthy weight loss is generally 1-2 pounds a week. The thing is that I started the semester weighing around 290 pounds, so since I started off weighing a lot, does that change what is a safe amount of weight to lose?"
Absent period,"For a year now I've \[22F\] been noticing really bad period cramps. Also, my hair has been shedding for a year and is noticeably less dense. I also had very bad unusual acne. And now my period hasnt came for 2 months and I had a weird pain in my stomach for a little and I thought it was my appendix. I went to the doctors twice in the year and expressed my concerns and they offered me birth control or said it was ""normal."" I did a basic blood test and TSH test and it was .7. I know for a fact something is wrong and its frustrating me."
"Never had a yeast infection, took less than a months dose of antibiotics and have been getting reoccurring yeast infections every month since","gender: F, age:15, race: Caucasian, height: 5'1, weight: 110lbs current medications: Blisovi Fe 1.5/30 (Birth Control pill)

Prior to last September, I had never gotten a yeast infection in my life. In early September 2018 though, I began taking Cefadroxil, as prescribed by my dermatologist, for my moderate acne. Quickly after beginning the antibiotic, I got an awful yeast infection, nothing in my normal routine had changed- except for the fact I had started the antibiotics, so I stopped taking them and told my dermatologist about it. I had only taken less than one months worth of a dose. I was taken off the Cefadroxil and instead put on topical lotion Clindamycin. 

Fast forward to a year later, I haven't taken the pills now in over a year, and ever since that first yeast infection in Sept 2018, I've gotten one nearly every single month after that. Again, no significant changes in my routine or diet, and I'm Greek so I would say my diet is pretty balanced overall, I keep good personal hygiene and shower every single day; I'm really confused as to why this keeps happening. Its extremely annoying and I literally so deeply regret even going to see a dermatologist. These yeast infections aren't as severe as the ones I got the first months since starting the Clindamycin, but they're definitely real and very bothersome and not to mention gross. I genuinely don't know what to do. This month I started a birth control for my acne and I'm afraid if I tell my physician about this problem, it'll be blamed on my birth control and  I'll be taken off my pill, even though this is how its been for the last year and my pill hasn't changed anything.

Primary Complaint: Almost constant dull headache

For the last few weeks I have had a persistent dull headache. It is almost painless but i can still feel it when its there and doesn't get any worse. It seems to go away when ever I sit up straight/fix my posture or take deep breathes which leads me to believe its stress related however I am unsure. I don't know if this could be related but for the last couple of months I have been in the process of losing weight after having blood pressure that was slightly too high. This has been done through a relatively restrictive diet (around 1700kcal/day) and regular exercise (three 5k runs a week). As a result I have lost over 20lb (over 10kg) and reduced my blood pressure. School exams and the university application process also seem to have coincided with this issue(which may suggest stress) however I haven't felt too stressed or anxious about that. Google has not been the best helper, if anything it has fueled any stress I may already have with fears of greater issues. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

My symptoms are the following ones:

- Headaches
- Fatigue
- Joint and muscle pain
- Anxiety
- Sensitivity to sound
- Nausea
- Feeling cold or sweating 

Background info:

Two months ago, I was sent home from work due to fatigue, headaches and feeling cold. Some weeks after that, I found a rash on my leg. It was itchy and I scratched it until it bled a few times. It grew bigger, redder and felt real hot and numb. At the hospital they said it might be Lyme and I got 21 days of antibiotics (200g of Doxycycline). I felt good after some weeks of Doxy, but at the third week I started to feel like shit again. Meanwhile the rash was all gone.


One week after the antibiotics, my symptoms worsened so much, that I went to the hospital again. There they gave me another load of Doxycycline for 21 days. I felt a little bit better, but still bad. Now the second round is over and I am here asking doctors of Reddit about it haha.

I myself am pretty sure, that I did not have Lyme disease, especially since there were no antibodies in my blood to be found, when my blood was drawn six weeks after the symptoms appeared, after I was done with the first round of Doxycycline. Plus I never found a tick on that spot - never ever. But hey maybe a mouth piece might have gotten stuck and infected me?

I also visited a psychologist for a diagnosis and she told me, that my symptoms may be somatic, but not to that extend - especially since they appeared suddenly.

I also went through an EEG and an MR, since my neurologist thought I may have a tumor - thanks God there was nothing.

Weird menstrual cycles.,"I'm a 25 year old white woman who is trying to conceive. I am 5'3 and 132lbs, I live in New Zealand and while I am disabled, it doesn't affect this issue (I have arthritis and both my doctors have said nothing about it will impact conceiving. I take Celebrex once a day, 200mg) 

My periods have always been normal, never too early or too late (28 day average), never too long or too short (5 day average). I had my regular period from August 1-5, with the usual one day of spotting. Nothing abnormal in the slightest there. On the 14th, I started spotting and my period arrived again on the 15th, lasting just three days with two days afterwards of spotting. First time since I began menstrating that I've had it twice in a month.

That cycle lasted just 23 days and my latest period arrived. Everything about this one was textbook, a day of spotting, five period days, a day of spotting. It was just a bit early but I had chalked it up to that weird second period in August.

On day 17 of my cycle, I began to spot again. Thinking I was due for another bimonthly period, I started to wear pads. But my pad captured nothing... And I spotted for 14 days, going from a very heavy spotting (clots, dark red or brown in days 2-3) to lighter but always brown, and only ever when wiping or peeing. Nothing ever reached the pad, not a single drop and wasn't bright fresh red blood like a period would be. Even now, 14 days after I started spotting, I have very liquid brown spotting on the paper when I wipe.

I thought my period was finally going to arrived on day 26 of my cycle, 10 days after the initial spotting. Every period feeling I normally get was present, as well as the spotting turning into dark red and lots of clots. But then it passed and back to normal within hours.

I've taken pregnancy tests and ovulation predictor kits, and both come back stark negative. My doctor is going to have a blood test done at day 3 of my period but I have no idea when that will be now, since I'm late but not pregnant. My cervical mucus is also dry, not the fertile consistency that you get before ovulation.

I just need advice or ideas so I can ask my doctor. I feel like because I'm trying for a baby and have only been trying for 6 months that nobody is taking me seriously, and I've been told that they can't help me until its been at least 24 months. But I haven't stopped bleeding (or spotting if that counts as bleeding) in 2 weeks, my period is late and I'm not pregnant.

Thank you."

I'm hoping someone might be able to offer some advice on some concerning symptom's I have been experiencing for the last two weeks which are causing me a lot of distress. I have searched the internet for hours but can find nothing which describes what I am experiencing.

The symptoms, I can only describe as feeling like something is loose and moving/flapping within my head/beneath my scalp and it is very concerning. It  feels like two 'things' are moving in relation to how I am moving i.e if I jump up and down they bounce, if I tilt my head to the side they feel like they are hanging, if I move my head quickly from side to side they feel like they are swinging... so literally like some skin or nerves attached to my head have become loose and is flapping around. If I sit very still they will start to pulsate, like a nearby vein or artery is touching it and making it move. The sensation never completely goes away.

The symptoms have progressed over the last two weeks and the sensation which initially started at the base of my skull on the left has spread up my head/scalp almost to the top and is now in two places - on both left and right on the back of my skull, along the route which it looks like the two occipital nerves and the arteries run. I am also feeling a lot of sensations in and around my mouth. Like something is hitting my back teeth/ moving along my teeth/ along the roof of my mouth , but from inside my head. The feelings are normally , but not always, fairly symmetrical, so if I feel something hit my teeth on the left it will probably hit on the right too. My tongue has also been burning and I keep experiencing a 'pulling' sensation on my tongue like it wants to move to the roof of my mouth. 

These symptoms started after a day of excessively using a 'Denner roller' provided to me by my chiropractor for loss of curvature of the spine that had been causing me bad cervicogenic headaches for the last couple of years.  I had been feeling my neck gradually loosening up in the weeks leading up to this day and using the Denner Roller had become slightly addictive. On this day I definitely overused the Denner roller. Initially I felt pleasant sensations of my neck feeling very loose and pain free, however after  a few hours I started to experience some concerning symptoms. It felt like something at the base of my skull on the left, near the atlas joint was moving/wobbling constantly. Worried I had done something serious to a bone in my neck or had torn something, I went to A and E who said they didn't know what it was but that it wasn't life threatening and perhaps I have irritated a nerve in my neck which is causing odd sensations and making it feel like something is moving when its not. 

Could it be possible that whilst loosening up my neck tissue on the Denner roller, the nerves have also become loose and are now in a constant state of motion? Or could it be torn soft tissue moving around on my scalp? Even more concerning, could it be the arteries which are moving? Is this even physically possible??

There isn't really any pain but I am very worried the symptoms will continue to escalate. Over the last 3-4 days I have started to feel quite a bit of tingling on my forehead and cheeks. 

I know this sounds very bizarre and I'm struggling to get my head around it myself. I will probably try and see a neurologist as my GP just looks at me blankly when I describe the symptoms and doesn't seem to appreciate how distressing this is for me. Will this recover? I'm unsure whether to rest it or to try and move it...I am scared moving will cause further damage.

Hey guys, smashed my thumb today which resulted in a subungual hematoma and a fractured distal phalange. This happened 11 hours ago.

Undiagnosed extremely painful chronic attacks. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!,"I [30M] have been experiencing painful stomach episodes since March of this year. I’m 5’8 about 190lb and don’t smoke or drink.

Basically what happens is I start to feel stomach cramps in my lower abdomen like I have diarrhea and as soon as I use the bathroom I have really watery diarrhea, almost like pee. Then the pain spikes and moves up my stomach to a few inches below the sternum. I then get hit with dizziness almost like the blood is draining out of my head. My feet, and sometimes my hands, start tingling/numbing and swelling and my stomach bloats. I get extremely weak and cannot hold myself upright. Once I broke out in hives across my entire body. I usually end up on the floor screaming in pain and struggling not to pass out.  This usually happens every 2-3 weeks.

The first time it happened I was working and had to pull over and use a gas station restroom. I ended up on the floor banging on the walls screaming until an employee came and called 911. Since then I I’ve been to the ER 3-4 times and am currently seeing a gastroenterologist and an allergist. 

They haven’t been able to diagnose what’s happening and I’ve done allergy testing, colonoscopy, pill cam, X-rays, CAT scans, and tons of bloodwork. 

So far the only thing they have been able to see is that I have elevated histamine levels which is why they were thinking it must be some sort of allergic reaction but they said it must be something internal because it was happening on a regular basis ever 2-3 weeks and I hadn’t introduced anything new or crazy into my environment or eating habits. 

I use the past tense because they put me on daily Allegra, Zyrtec, and Ranitidine which has seemed to help. I hadn’t had an attack for 2-3 months and was really hoping this would at least be a short term answer until we could figure out the actual problem. 

Fast forward to last night and I had another attack even with staying on top of my daily meds. I’m at the end of my rope. Hopefully someone out there has some answers! I just want to know what’s happening so I can at least try to do something about it or accept my fate. It sucks just living every day on edge waiting for crippling pain to strike without knowing why."
Is my irregular period something I should be worried about / can I do something about it?,"Info: 20F, 160cm, 90kg, white
Complaint: Period lasting too long
Duration: around 6 months
No medical issues or regular medication

I’ve had the contraceptive implant (Nexplanon) since February 2018 so around 20 months now. I was advised by my nurse that my periods should settle down and become more regular after 6 months - a year of having the implant. At the start of this year I appeared to have gotten into a regular cycle of 3 months without period, 1 full month of bleeding. However it then turned to 1 month period free, 1 month bleeding. The last time I had a period it lasted from 29th August - 23rd September. I’ve had less than 2 weeks period-free and I’ve woken up this morning with painful cramps (pretty usual for me) and having bled through my underwear. 

This doesn’t feel normal as I was told that no matter what ‘regular’ was (eg. No period at all, a constant period, monthly etc) I should be in a regular cycle by now.

Is there something that could be causing this? Should I be worried / is there need to see a doctor? Is there anything I can do? I love the mental health benefits I’ve gained from getting the implant but I can’t afford to buy sanitary products to last 90% of the year!

Broken collarbone,"18M, 6 feet tall, roughly 95kg, I broke my collarbone 5 days ago (it was a clean break and there is a fair amount of displacement) I play rugby twice a week and go to the gym 1/2 times a week. 

I was just wondering if I could get more opinions on whether or not I should have surgery. I've been told I'll have a plate put into my collarbone, will that effect my sport? Are the complications of surgery anything to worry about that much? (I was told they can screw too far and hit a nerve or an artery or something in my shoulder?) I've also been told if I let it heal naturally it should be fine but the muscle will become a slight bit slack because the collarbone will heal shorter than natural.

Extreme nerve(?) pain in my right shoulder blade and my left arm,"I [21F] put the question mark there cuz I'm not sure if it's nerve pain or not since I've never been professionally diagnosed with something like pinched nerves or whatever, but it’s definitely not like sore muscle pain and I wasn’t hit there nor have I fallen/bumped into anything that would affect that area. I’m 5’3” and 155lbs. I’ve noticed the pain got worse as I lost weight. Starting in February, I’ve lost around 10lbs a month. I think my large breast size might be a factor as to why my back hurts even more as I lose weight everywhere but my breasts. (I’ve gone down like 4 band sizes but I’m still a DDD cup) I brought this up to my doctor and she said it could be something like carpal tunnel from the repetitive motions I make at my job (pizza place) but some of my symptoms are weird so she wasn’t sure. She referred me to physical therapy but state healthcare moves slow as shit and apparently they’re only capable of calling me while I’m at work and unable to answer my phone so nothing’s happened there. On to the symptoms:

The pain is ridiculous. It’s throbbing and deep, almost a warm kind of pain, if that makes any sense. It’s located on the inside of my lower right shoulder blade and it extends in a egg kind of shape about 3 to 4 inches in diameter.  It comes and goes, usually after a long shift or after doing something like art or laundry on the ground. But sometimes the pain will hit me without warning and without cause. I’ll just be sitting in a restaurant and all of a sudden I want to cry from the pain I’m in. The weird part is sometimes it will go numb (it’s like after you sober up after dental work and you can feel that your mouth is still numb) and I won’t be able to feel the skin around the area but the pain will still be there, throbbing. And now when I use my upper left arm muscles in an upward flex I’ll feel the same kind of deep, intense pain that’ll kinda immobilize my arm for like 2 seconds. Although they might not be completely related (the arm pain started last night after stretching my arm a certain way and feeling a pop/crunch) the pain feels the same. I’m not sure what’s going on, but any immediate remedies would be lovely so I can do something to ease the pain until I can go to an urgent care. Also pain meds, like ibuprofen, don’t help."

Wednesday night I went to a loud concert.  Up near the stage with no hearing protection.  I haven't been but to 2 concerts ever.  Since then, it is now Sunday, and I still have a ringing in my ears.  Googling has of course frightened me to no end.  Hear are some details about what I am experiencing.  A high pitched ringing sound in what seems to be both ears.

Other than that, I am not overly sensitive, and I can hear everything from birds chirping to casual conversation to someone in another room zip up a purse.  I have noticed if I lay on either side, that ear has a slight pressure to it, nothing painful, just like it has a need to drain.  Yesterday, for about an hour, I feel like it almost completely went away in my left ear for about an hour, as well as dimming down in my right ear, only to come back.

night blindness and vit. a deficiency," M20 170 lb 5'11"" 

I have had chronic dry eye for a while, and now it feels like it is harder to see at night. I don't know how to tell if I have night blindness, but I can basically only see where my headlights are pointing. In my peripheral vision, I can only see something when it's basically next to my car! It freaks me out when I see a pedestrian pop up in my periphery when I get close but not before. Bright lights also irritate my eyes, usually early in the morning or at night. I also only really eat for macronutrient ratios, and I found out that the only thing I might be eating that has vitamin A is my fortified cereal (it has 10% dv and I eat it maybe twice a week).

23M and can't stop laughing,"Age: 23

Sex: Male

So I've always had this little condition in which I'd be joking around with friends or family and would be laughing normally, and at any moment I'd get into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. My friends would always find this behavior extremely off-putting, and they'd start making jokes about it which would make me laugh even harder. Even if they don't joke but just utter something about it, the laughter increases to a point where I'm coughing, can't breathe and get extreme pain in my belly from it.

I'm posting this because of the recent release of the Joker movie where Joker's character actually has a condition (called pseudobulbar affect) where he will start to laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate situations, but I do not think my ""condition"" is similar at all. I initially only start laughing at funny jokes or situations which may trigger uncontrollable laughter, but once it's triggered then I just laugh at pretty much anything (even getting slapped). The only way to stop it is if everyone goes silent while I regain my composure. Because of the movie I've been getting a lot of comments about my condition relating me to Joker.

My friends have been misdiagnosing me with the Joker condition, and any searches on the internet for my condition only leads me to the same laughing disorder. I haven't had any trauma to my brain that would trigger this. I've had this problem since I was a child, and not just me, but I share this with my mother who would laugh just as uncontrollably sometimes. On many occasions, my mother and I would get a fit of laughter while with our family and seeing each other laugh like crazy would make us laugh even more. So hard, that we'd both end up on the floor laughing while the rest of our family gets upset at our behavior.

I just want to know what this problem could be.

One thing I should add is that I have another issue related to laughing (which might or might not be related). I smile, or giggle whenever I'm in a situation where I'm nervous. For example, if put on the spot and asked whether I'm lying about something, I usually start smiling or giggling even though I'm telling the truth, leading people to think that I'm obviously lying. Another very inappropriate moment where I'd do that is if people tell me about someone dying in their family or a tragedy, and I have to hold back my smile or cover my face with my hands in a shocked gesture so I don't look rude. It's not that I find it funny at all... I just can't control that. I hope any of you have the right idea about what this problem is. Thank you."
[20M] Night sweats with fever.,"Age: 20

No previous or current medical issues

I recently started uni, and within the first 2 weeks I caught the ""Freshers' flu"", which was basically just coughing and sneezing, nothing too bad. Once that started to clear up, I went to see my girlfriend, who was also ill. A few days after I got back, I had a sore throat, some coughing, and later that night, a fever. The fever was in the 38 - 39 range, and was accompanied by a mild headache, some body ache, and some chills. I took some Paracetamol and it became much more tolerable, and I went to sleep. The next day, I had the same symptoms, and a fever again, and I went to sleep with a duvet on me because I was cold from the fever. I woke up absolutely covered in sweat. I figured it was normal, and that at some point my fever went away, and my body realized it's being cooked by a duvet, and just made me sweat profusely. For the next 2 days, I had some coughing, no chills or fever, but every time I sleep, I sweat. Even if it's a 1 hour nap, I still sweat. I've never had night sweats before in my life by the way.

I'm going to give it a few days and then see a doctor if it persists, but after Googling night sweats, I'm pretty much paranoid right now, so it'd be nice to hear some opinions from doctors after they've read my post. Thanks in advance.

By the way, my girlfriend hasn't experienced any of those symptoms, not even a fever."

Hi everyone, 

Lately I’ve been experiencing something with my eyes, mainly my right one, that’s been worrying me. Before I start I just want to say I fully intend to call an eye doctor on Monday, but was curious if anyone could give any insight at the moment. Once today and once yesterday I experienced what I could best describe as a light in my right eye, the best way I can describe it is when you look at a bright light or the sun for too long and you look away and can still see it for a few moments, despite not looking at anything bright. This lasted for maybe 10 minutes both today and yesterday and then went away, and I also remember it happening once a few months ago as well. I think I should mention also I’ve been spending a LOT of time on the computer (hours and hours, late at night) for school every single day and have also been extremely stressed out. I’m not sure if it’s the amount of time I’ve been spending on the computer, especially being focused, reading assignments, doing problems for hours on end etc. I also do not wear glasses or contacts but definitely do not have the best vision (which of course I’ll bring up at the eye doctor) I’m not experiencing any pain, but I have been very sleep deprived and sometimes my eyes get heavy from being so tired. I googled my symptoms which of course I shouldn’t have because now I’m terrified I have a retina detachment! Could that really be what this is? If anyone could give me any insight or help calm my nerves that would be very appreciated!


Thank you for your time!"

"Lump in throat, bad breath","27F, 164cm, 65kg, mixed race. I've had a weird sensation in my throat for a few months now and for a while now I think it's giving me a bad breath. I don't take any medication, don't drink, don't smoke and don't do drugs. 

A few months ago, I ate some nuts and I felt a really thin, long, jagged piece of the nut lodge itself inside my throat. I waited a few weeks and I could still feel it, so I ended up going to the doctor who told me it was just phantom sensation, that it would go away and not to worry. Now, it's been a while and I can still feel something weird in my throat - at the same spot, I can feel something lots of mucus and I try to swallow everything down but nothing is going down. I do not have allergies and I've tried cleaning my nose with saline solution but it has no effect on the mucus sensation in my throat. My throat also feels slightly inflamed and it's giving me bad breath in spite of reasonably good mouth hygiene (I brush, scrape my tongue, floss and use mouthwash). 

Yesterday I checked my tonsils and my tonsils were noticeably redder than my uvula and the rest of my mouth, but they weren't swollen. I also saw one white piece of debris, I took it out but I didn't see anything else like tonsil stones embedded inside the tonsils.  

I guess I'm posting here because I'm not even sure there is a point to going to the doctor since I have no tangible proof of anything. Any advice?"

Blood clot or physical anxiety? (Picture),"Age: 18

I’m a hypochondriac and have had tight chest pain, stiff neck, shortness of breath, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, numb legs and arms, wrist pain, eye twitching, muscle spasms and some other things all in the past 2 weeks because of a bad reaction to a THC cartridge which made me panic. I’ve been to the ER twice in the past two weeks thinking I was going to die twice but after Xrays, EKG’s, urine tests and blood tests I’ve been marked perfectly fine which made me and my doctor come to the conclusion that I’m just super paranoid and got bad anxiety. Well a couple days ago I noticed the left side of my right foot was swollen, I shrugged it off because I didn’t feel any pain, on 2 different days a couple days apart I’ve felt a weird 5 second sting in the same exact spot next to a vein in my foot where the swollen foot seems the most red, should I be concerned and should I get checked out or is this just another physical pain, I asked my mom to take me to med express and she said no because we’ve been to the ER twice and the insurance would get pissed at us. My calf seems and looks fine with no redness but my foot is the total opposite. Some second opinions would be nice, I’m meeting with my family doctor this Friday regarding my anxiety but I’m not sure if I could wait that long to get my foot checked out, if you think something is wrong write it below to convince my mom to take me to med express, if nothing is wrong also let me know.

How long would THC/ Marijuana be in my system?,"21. Female. 100lbs.

I was never dependent on it, never craved it, I have great self control. I drink for special occasions and it’s nice to relax off a beer or two. I do miss getting high here and there and was curious, if I ate a gummy with THC in it once, how long would it stay in my system? Or should I even be concerned with consuming it? I’d love to just stay home and watch a good movie high and have fun eating snacks with the munchies! Thanks in advanced!

Primary complaint: I have had puss filled sores that are usually larger and pussier than a normal pimple. They have a red ring of redness around them usually. There are usually at least 13 on my scalp at any given time. They also show up in my nose, cleavage, and occasionally my bottom and back. (Dr 1) A derm tested it and said it was staph. He gave me antibiotics and it was semi better as I took them but it came right back full force the day after i stopped and it never went away permanently. He also added topical cream but it did nothing (Dr 2) dr told me to take bleech baths and said it was folliculitis. They gave me antibiotics and It didn’t help long term either. (Dr 3) gave us (my husband too 33M) some scalp shampoo with higher zinc: DHS 2%. This didn’t help either. (Dr 4) gave us (I guess this is contagious and husband gave it to me when he came back from a hospital visit) aggressive treatment to do several months of chorahexadine body wash and mupirocin in nose. This didn’t make it clear up either. (Dr 5, infectious diseases doc) took a sample of a pimple on my face (a special test that tests what exact antibiotic kills it) it came back as cutibacterium. And offered antibiotics. I thought since it wasn’t sampled from the scalp it wasn’t the right thing to test. So we tested a scalp sore. But it came back as no growth possibly because it wasn’t a juicy enough one. He told me to just go see a dermatologist because he can’t figure it out. I was hesitant to try the cutibacterium antibiotics because if this is MRSA or antibiotic resistant staph, antibiotics will only make it stronger. And I have possibly already made it stronger by the antibiotics I’ve already taken.—-what doc should I go to next? What do you think this is? How do I cure it, it’s driving me crazy and I’m losing tons of hair possibly permanently and I have long pretty blonde hair so it’s a nightmare.

I've had this on my face for a couple of days. It seems to have gotten a bit bigger. It's not raised, more just dry and flaky, but the appearance worries me. In the beginning, it was smaller and completely clear in the middle. Now, it's slighty larger and is red in the center. I went to an urgent care and they gave me an antifungal cream, but it's been burning my face. I'm trying to make a dermatologist appointment, but I am freaking out a bit. I believe the redness on the rest of my cheek is irritation from the cream. Until I can get some advice, I've been applying tea tree oil. Also, I think it has gotten less red as the days have gone on. It only gets that red when irritated. Otherwise it is more of a flaky skin colored spot (it was always red at first)."

Extremely painful sore throat,"30m, 260LB, 5'11""

Never felt like this before.  What started as scratchy throat, turned into daggers being shoved down my throat whenever I swallow. I went to the doctor and she suspected strep, so she gave me antibiotics and ibuprofen until the test is done. Strep came back negative. She suspected Mononucleosis, so I stopped the amoxicillin. Today the Mononucleosis came back negative. I am SO confused. Can it be bacterial without being strep? Can it be Viral without being Mono?

In the blood test it showed that I have high # of WBC, Monocytes and Neutrophils . Based on these results, the doctor is suspecting it's bacterial again, but it's already negative for strep..so HOW?

Pain slightly below hip 19 Y/O Female,"Greetings Reddit. I am a 19 year old female, weigh about 160 and about 5'4, no medical history. 2 weeks ago I noticed a dull ache in my left hip side. I shrugged it off as sleeping weird. A few days passed and it persisted. I thought it could be a PMS symptom so I again shrugged it off. My period ended 3 days ago and I still feel a dull ache in my left hip. It does not hurt when I urinate so I do not think it could a kidney infection or anything. I tried sleeping in a different position but it did not help. What could it possibly be and when should I see a doctor? If anyone needs more information, I will be glad to provide it.

The issue:
I started to get what I thought were just chapped lips on the corners, opening wide would be painful and result in the feeling of my skin cracking. Next day my whole mouth hurt. It felt like I cuts all over my tongue, all my gums felt swollen, couldn't brush my teeth with a tooth brush it was so painful. I developed little bumps all over my lips, they were raised, slightly pale. (I had pictures I just can't figure out how to upload them). Swallowing hurt, chewing hurt, moving my tongue hurt, opening my mouth or moving my lips hurt. I had white circle looking sore under my tongue. Everything including water burned when I drank it. I went to a doctor and he took a look and said oral herpes and prescribed me acyclovir every 8 hours. I just don't understand. I hadn't been exposed to it. I am in a monogamous relationship, have never had a cold sore or anything like this pop up. After a couple days of tylenol and acyclovir the white spots in my mouth are pretty much gone. But the corners of my lips are actually getting worse. They weep and make crusties and while I can't see the bumps anymore I can still feel them when I press my lips together (it feels like I have sea salt or sand on my lips). the area of cracked,  red skin that is weeping is getting bigger I feel like. 
After being told it's herpes I did so much reading but I am just not convinced.

Edit: I uploaded 2 pictures, one of the bumps on my lip, and one of the corner of my mouth that is red and weeping. Would also like to add that the skin on the corners of my mouth are not bumpy like as described in a herpes outbreak.

Duration and location of complaint: About 2.5 weeks, small intestine (upset stomach, diarrhea/abnormal stool, uncomfortable gas)

\------------------------------------

I got my appendix out just a little over a month ago on August 27, recovery was a bit rough but once I was finally out of the hospital things seemed to heal normally.

For the past two + weeks though (about 3 after surgery) my stomach has been in shambles and I've had diarrhea/abnormal stool, stomach aches, and uncomfortable gas that's audible inside me every day. I thought maybe I had some kind of infection related to the surgery, but my surgeon didn't think so. The only thing I've done so far is get tested for c.difficile toxin which is apparently something you can get just by taking antibiotics, and it came out negative. My surgeon said this is pretty much the only thing that would have caused this if it was related to the surgery. More recently (this week) I've been noticing small amounts of bright blood in my stool as well.

**I'm beginning to suspect I've developed IBS or Celiac or some kind of intolerance to something as a relation to the stress from the appendectomy, what are the chances of this?**

I still haven't gone to see another doctor about it other than the surgeon, partially because I'm not sure where to go (an urgent care? A gastro specialist? My tiny primary care office that I've only been to once and wasn't super impressed with?) and also partially because I don't want them to just hand me some anti-diarrheal and call it a day.

Chest Pains - Non Cardiac Advice,"35M, 319lbs, 6ft, White. High Blood pressure 140/85.

I over stressed and over caffeinated myself about 2 years ago with some life events. My heart would be resting at about 120 along with left side chest discomfort. It wouldn’t drop unless I was asleep. Had the tests for heart disease and came back with a blocked artery (Nuclear Stress test). Fast forward two weeks later had a doc try to put a heart cath and stent in my arteries only to find out on the operating table that it wasn’t necessary. The test was a false positive. I’m only 35.

They put me on a beta blocker and my heart rate sits around 85 to 90 now. Much better. If I forget to take it for a day or two it ramps back up. My doc now believes it’s a anxiety or panic disorder.

Strangely, my symptoms mimic angina. For example a long hike or working out I will get chest tightness and feel like I can't catch my breath coupled with chest discomfort. Obviously, I'm out of shape at 319lbs but have always hiked and never had issues with keeping pace as I do now.

My question - is there somewhere else I should be looking for the cause of these issues? It can be quite annoying when it acts up - makes me feel like a heart attack and only fuels the fire. The only illness/injury I can think of before this event started was a left arm injury, where I pulled the muscle in the my left arm/shoulder, but the initial event never cause any pain, only a few days after. On occasion, eating can create the feeling."

Mitochondrial Myopathy?,"I was just watching a YouTube video, where someone in it brought up that they have Mitochondrial Myopathy. She talked about not getting a second wind. This made me pause, because I don't get a second wind after exercise or exertion, and have been wondering why for a while. I was probably 29 or 30 when I really started experiencing symptoms. One example is going to my brother's wedding. I wore heels and was only there for a couple of hours. My legs were sore for days after and I felt exhausted, like I had just been running for miles. It took a week to finally feel better. I have been doing a lot of sleeping, as well. I was able to walk a couple of blocks the other day without feeling tired, so maybe symptoms come and go? I don't go to the gym any more, because it takes me days to recover after working out. An example is using a weight machine at 190 pounds or so, coming back to the gym two or three days later, and I can only do 15 pounds. I felt sore and tired and depleted for a week thereafter.

"Without a gradual warm-up to any aerobics, I get total jello legs after even a minute of exercise?","30F, 150lb, 5'7
No major medical history other than anxiety (possible GAD), depression... possible concussion as an elementary school kid, possible dance-induced stress fracture in my foot in high school. Recent medical history includes primary ovarian insufficiency and anti-thyroid antibodies, so that's fun. So current meds are hormone replacement therapy. That's it. 
Duration of complaint, honestly I think is like, over a decade. I certainly remember noticing it when I was taking dance regularly, and have been thinking about it again as I notice it when I jog or dance. I had just assumed it was normal then asked a friend and they said maybe I should ask around. Basically ""warm-ups"" totally KO my muscles and I always have to do my own thing for a bit and ease into any aerobic activity. I usually walk for like, 10 minutes prior to starting to jog for example - but when I start jogging, I feel like I really have to stop after less than a minute and give my legs some recovery time. My calves feel like jello and I am almost scared to use them because I worry it will trigger a cramp (I used to get those horrible calf cramps pretty often so I am a bit scared of them). They feel loose and not strong as if I had just finished an exhaustive workout. If I walk for a few minutes I can slowly ease back into the moderate exercise and go about my workout like any normal person. Back when I was doing regular dance classes I would have the same issue and would need to warm up on my own because, say, skipping around in a circle right off the bat would result in the same feeling. 
...so is this normal? I have never gotten anything related to this checked out at a doc because I have just assumed I was out of shape or that this is a normal thing, even if I had been exercising for hours each week. Potentially related things is I have always been one of those people that gets light-headed when I stand up too fast, my resting heart rate is a touch below ""normal"" as far as I can tell, like closer to 50bpm."

So 3 or 4 months ago I noticed that I almost constantly had a mild tension headache. I didn't think a lot of it, I've been diagnosed with depression and I really only notice it when I think about it. Anyways, maybe a month or two after that, I started getting a numb and cold feeling in my feet, legs, arms, and hands. I asked my mom to feel my hands when it happened a few times and she said they felt cool, but didnt think it was cold enough to he concerned. Blankets, fire, and hot showers didnt help. I didn't think that much of it. But now, about a week ago I started getting the bouts of dizziness, they last probably less than a second and come 2-5 times an hour. Sometimes it's when I move my head, sometimes it's when I'm completely still.lpp Should I see a doctor? I have a family history on both sides of diabetes, so could that possibly be it?"

Hey guys. So since around late winter of 2018, I've been dealing with this annoying issue where my skin, primarily my torso, will randomly break out in rashes. The rashes kind of look like hives, in the fact that they're red and kind of ""spotty"", but do not have the blistering and madness-inducing itchiness that hives bring. Oftentimes these breakouts will be all over my torso, front and back, and it produces a different madness-inducing sensation- the best way i can describe it is that it's like a prickly sensation- as if a bunch of tiny needles were repeatedly poking my skin. It's kind of like ""pins and needles"" but just on top of my skin. Sometimes I can feel the prickly sensation on my arms and legs too. Its not particularly painful, but its incredibly annoying.

Strangely enough, these outbreaks will go away within a few minutes, but will sometimes happen repeatedly- like ill have one breakout, it will go away, then another one a few minutes later. Talk about really annoying. Also strange, is that moving to a cooler area or finding another way to cool myself off, will generally alleviate an outbreak too. I suspect that it could be a heat rash, as heat can trigger it (I found that having the water too hot in the shower will trigger an outbreak, but then the outbreak will almost immediately go away if i make the water cooler) but, I'd think a heat rash would not be so random, I dont even have to be in a hot area for this to happen. But, it also seems to worsen during the fall (which it's worsened again in the last week or so), but tends to get a little better in the spring. During summer months, these breakouts have been few and far between, but it becomes bad again in Fall. Also, I've noticed that momentary stress (basically just an ""Oh shit"" moment) will sometimes trigger a breakout.

I dont think it's an allergy- its not really correlated with anything I eat or do as far as i can tell. The closest thing I can find for a trigger is heat, but many times it seems to happen at random. Basically, this issue is like this- Im just going about my day, and then suddenly my torso breaks out in rashes that produce an intense prickly sensation. Typically goes away within a few minutes, but, its so damn annoying when it happens. Sometimes it happens repeatedly, which is where it gets REALLY annoying.

It's bad to the point where I freeze up for about 30s to about a minute where concsiously I can only process very basic and linear thoughts. And it happens randomly throughout the day. The way I uually snap out of it is when I stare to long my mind drifts then I just basically ask my self why I'm just staring at nothing then I look around the room and I'm back.

"28M took a tumble on my bike, perhaps stretched my hand a bit... possible tendon/ligament damage?","Took a bad turn on my bike and took a tumble, and I think my right hand stretched a bit more than it was supposed to.

Immediately after the fall I felt there was no severe injury (prob the adrenaline) but after getting back home (5 min) I checked myself over, and found that my right hand was aching (or tingling) a bit, and saw this series of bumps, see following pic:

15 min later this disappeared, the hand now looks normal, but the aching and slight pain persists in the hand, perhaps more when I bend the fingers. I'm really hoping this resolves itself after I get a nights' sleep, but I've also heard stories of such injuries actually having damaged or severed the tendons in the hands, and this could be a precursor to that.

The upper-middle area of my forearm has been very sore all day. It honestly has just felt like a really extreme case of DOMS and that’s all I thought it was until I noticed it had swollen up. 

I worked biceps earlier this week, and they’ve been sore, but I haven’t noticed any forearm pain until today.

I’ve been rubbing it out pretty hard, so I’m hoping I didn’t do anything to damage it further. I get sore forearms like this every now and then, but I’ve never had a bulge like this on my arm, so just wanted to check"
Taking Diphenhydramine with an SSRI,"Hi,

TFCC Wrist Injury,"&#x200B;

Hi,

I am 30M, 6 ft, anywhere from 205-220 lbs depending, non smoker, rarely drink. I am very active in the gym and sports (although not as much lately due to my coming question).

I have been dealing with a TFCC tear in my right wrist for approx 8 months now. Originally it started with me not even being able to make a fist, to progressing a good amount where now I can get back into playing sports and lifting weights (very carefully and smartly). It is still quite not right though, and it is frustrating.

I have been to the doctor numerous times and tried anti-inflammatory drugs, I have had a cortisone shot, and have been to physio therapy as well. X-rays came back negative as well so no bones broken. I am still going to physio but it seems that I have hit a point where nothing is happening in my recovery. I can do most things, but with pain, and then need a day or two to ice and have limited use to get it back to feeling okay. Flexion is the worst, especially when pressure is applied - eg. doing a push up.

Now my question is - would a small amount of hGH be beneficial to helping the full healing process? It has been suggested to me by a few others who have used it for knee injuries, shoulder injury. I am talking a very small, controlled amount, for a limited time. 1-2 IU’s, two days on, one day off, for a period of ???? I am not sure what kind of duration I should try (IF I go this route).

Any information would be appreciated.

Thanks"
Throat feeling weird and stomach rolling?,"Female 17
Period ended Wednesday(4 days ago)
So today I woke up and try and get ready for work. Forgetting about Breakfast. Work start at 11am for me that day. But then around 10 I get a call, and it turn out I didn’t need to work. So I start on homework and would be doing homework till 7pm. But I never ate much at all today. I made chicken nuggets(Not the best food choice) around 11 o’clock when I felt hungry. So I put them in the air fryer and continue working on my school work. But then I forgot about them for a good 20 minutes before realizing I have some, and I ate. The next time I ate was around 5-6pm. A walking taco. My throat then started feeling weird. Not scratchy, but it feel like it’s puffing up or something. I then ate these bakery Dutch ginger cookies. Not a lot and some popcorn. Around 7pm I felt uncomfortable. My stomach started to feel weird, and my throat still feel weird.

I’m not normally forgetful when it come to eating, and my diet is usually a bit better than this. It should also be noted that my younger sister(15) brought a lot of friends over, and I’m always stress out by that. I’m worry this might be food poisoning"

Ringing in ears has gotten worse,"

I’m 18, female, around 140 lbs and I don’t drink, smoke, or take any medications. I haven’t experienced any super loud noises or anything around me that could have caused this either. I don’t have any head trauma history or really any medical history concerning this. 

Hearing loss and problems with hearing runs in my moms side of the family, so there’s a 50/50 chance I could lose my hearing like she did. 

She lost hers when she was pregnant with me though, I don’t know if that makes a difference for me or anything. 

I can’t remember a time before my ears were ringing, they’ve always done that. I thought that was normal. Apparently not. I left it alone and never said anything about it because it didn’t bother me too much, only when I would have migraines or headaches. 

Recently, as in like as of today, my ears are ringing extremely loud. To the point where it’s almost hard to hear over it, but I’m still able to. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, I’ve never seen the doctor about this problem. It’s almost close to unbearable. It’s not as bad when I have some background noise, like YouTube playing or my AC running, so it’s not so quiet. 

Should I try to go to the doctor tomorrow and call in at work? Is this an emergency or is there no point in rushing to the doctor? I’m not sure what could have caused the ringing to get worse, I haven’t had any loud noises around me, I haven’t eaten anything different (if that even makes a difference), and really just nothing out of the ordinary. I work in the morning and I’m currently at my moms house, so if it gets worse by morning I’ll tell her and see what she says and go from there. But if anyone else has any advice or other concerns, I’d appreciate some light being shed on this as I’m really unsure about what I should do tomorrow."

It flows like smoke, looks like smoke and doesn't impair my vision, but it's noticeable that it's there. I know it's inside my eye because I can't look at it directly. It's more apparent when looking at dark surfaces and the phenomenon seems to be noticeable in my peripheral vision. Direct vision is not affected.

[https://imgur.com/a/nRMKerq](https://imgur.com/a/nRMKerq)"
concerned my mom [58f] has been developing early onset dementia,"some details: my mom is about 5'6, 150 pounds, this has been progressing over the past 5 years, she is on off brand lexapro right now (not sure of dosage), she is a heavy smoker.

i first noticed this around 5 years ago when she came to visit me after i moved out of the house. she was forgetting words here and there, repeating herself a bit, and i'd find myself having to answer the same questions over and over. it wasn't that bad then, but i was concerned, and i said something to my dad about it. nothing happened then.

since then, it has gotten much worse. i don't live at home anymore and i see her roughly every 6 months or so. because of this, the severity of it seems magnified because every time i see her she is a little bit worse, and i dont see the ""gradual"" shift that my sister or dad might see.

she repeats herself over and over; she often says the same things many times over the course of an hour. i will answer a question for her, and a few minutes or less later she will ask me that same question. last time i was home, she asked me what day i was flying back at least 10 times over a 3 day span. talking to her is unsettling and difficult. it's hard to have a conversation with her.

it is worse in other ways, though. i could excuse the forgetfulness if it didnt manifest in these ways:

\- she can't drive anymore; she has very little reaction time, and when i was in the car with her last time i saw her, her car's emergency auto brakes had to activate twice because she almost hit the car in front of her at a stop light. i mentioned this to my dad and he admitted that was why he got her a car with that feature. she can't park, either; she will park almost completely sideways and then get out of the car like she doesn't notice. she said to me ""what, am i over the lines?"" when i quietly got out of the passenger seat and got into the drivers seat to repark.

\- she forgot how to write her name. she's had the same signature for my entire life and one day she forgot how to do it. i don't know if that extends to printing her name as well, but forgetting her signature was really scary for me

\- she can no longer do anything by herself. when we're out at a restaurant, someone has to order for her. when we're paying at the grocery store, someone has to do it for her. she can no longer answer questions or request anything from service workers. instead, she will turn to me (or whoever is with her) and indicate that we are in charge

\- she forgot her social security number, and then when i asked her how that was possible, she said ""i dont think i've ever known it"" which is completely impossible

\- the family dog has gained a lot of weight because she will feed her, forget that she fed her, and feed her again. the same goes with giving her treats

\- my dad is now afraid of leaving her home alone when he goes on business trips because he doesnt think she can do things for herself anymore

i am sure im forgetting things

i have tried to get through to my family about getting her to see a doctor, but they insist that it isnt what i think it might be. they took her to a general practitioner who prescribed her lexapro and nothing else. obviously she is depressed and anxious, but i think those are symptoms of a bigger problem, not the problem itself. i really think she should see a neurologist but my family seems to think im overreacting. 

if she were older, much older, i could easily chalk all this up to age, but she's 58. i dont think it adds up

tl;dr: my mom has lost the ability to do many things on her own and forgets words/repeats questions constantly, my family thinks she's just depressed but i think she should see a neurologist because i suspect early onset dementia. am i overreacting? what else could this be? how should i approach this?"
Long term headaches,"Age: 24

Height: five feet, ten inches

Weight: 190 pounds

Race: Caucasian (Canadian)

Duration of complaint: about six months

Location: most often temples, often back of head around the prominent bony bump, less often but commonly radiating from temples to top of head

Any existing relevant medical issues: Gilbert's syndrome, celiac disease

Current medications: pantoprazole for recurring heartburn

I've had headaches in the areas described for a few months now. For a stretch, I'll have them every day, but then I might not get one for a few days. A couple months before the headaches started, my dad was suddenly taken for distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy for pancreatic cancer and subsequent chemotherapy. Also around the same time I went through a change in employer. However, this is not anxiety: my dad has since completed chemo and been cleared, and this new job is going extremely well; I wanted to impress that I am at a healthy stress level. Nothing significant has taken place before or after the headaches started to be able to explain them.

I've had headaches for as long as I can remember, my first headache likely was some time around 2003, so it's pain that I'm used to. The difference now is that it seems to come back so frequently. Perhaps it's not relevant, but for as long as I can remember I've had some sort of tinnitus that I can hear during silence. I've never used any sort of recreational drugs, smoked, or drank alcohol. 

I've discussed this issue with a doctor at a local clinic, and was diagnosed with tension headaches, and recommended to try acupuncture or other alternative medicine. While I have good insurance, I don't have much coverage for this sort of alternative medicine. It's not that I'm not satisfied by the doctor's diagnosis - I respect it and believe it, but I just don't know what to do after dealing with headaches for this long. They leave me utterly exhausted. 

In a support and programming role, I spend lots of my day at the computer - I can't change this, but I've tried to make sure I have good ergonomics. Having Gilbert's syndrome, I find Tylenol does very little to help, and I try to take as little Advil as I can, but when I need relief, I need relief. Experts, is there anything I might be able to try, or look for, to find relief? I'd be happy to provide additional details."

37F Is Mitral Valve Prolapse causing anxiety-driven paresthesia?,"I've been experiencing paresthesias for the past month or so now. Started with pins and needles in my hands, spread to my arms and elbows with added aches. I was convinced I had carpal tunnel but then started feeling pinprick and crawling sensations pretty much all over. It seems to be random with no triggers, some days pretty constant. I am not experiencing any numbness and the sensations are not particularly painful, just annoying and concerning. The sensations do not affect my sleep. Other symptoms I am experiencing are random heart palpitations and digestive issues. My digestion has been ""off"" for at least a month now, some days feels like I have IBS, other days just soft stools. 

I am a 37 year old female, 120lbs, 5'4, active and am not on any medications. I occasionally use cannabis and less often will have a drink. I have ruled out serious medical conditions such as MS or fibromyalgia because the symptoms just don't seem to fit. I got a basic blood test done and everything came back normal including my vitamin B and potassium levels. The only condition that seems to fit is anxiety/stress, however I'm not in any stressful situations and am very laid back and calm in general. I do have mitral valve prolapse and I was reading it can cause anxiety that is not emotionally triggered. Could this be the case? The only other thing I have thought of is that I may have high levels of mercury in my body as I've been eating an increased amount of seafood. Mostly tuna and salmon a few times a week. 

I don't have insurance so am putting off seeing a neurologist and hoping the symptoms will go away on their own. Any feedback is much appreciated!"

(22M) Stabbing pain with deep breaths and occasional shortness of breath.,"This is a long post and I'm sorry, but I'm scared.

**information**: White Male 22 year old, 5'7 245lbs. Non smoker, drink ocasionally, have taken edibles, but condition has been around longer than when I first tried edibles.

**Complaint**: Since late to mid august I have had occasional stabbing pains when breathing in deeply. The pain most often happens in my right lower side, but occasionally near the center of my chest, or the upper left side. The pain only lasts for a spilt second. I also feel the need to take deep breaths more often than I think is normal(However I wouldn't consider it shortness of breath). I do somethings get actual shortness of breath where I feel the need to constantly take deep breaths in.

I did have a similar issue that lasted for months earlier in the year with stabbing pain when breathing deeply, but it wasn't as bad as it is now, and from what I remember no shortness of breath.  I do not remember having the condition during the summer months.

**History:** Last saturday was pretty bad for me (as was this current saturday) so I went to urgent care they listened to my lungs, and told me it was probably just anxiety or a musculoskeletal issue and sent me home on 600MG of ibuprofen 4 times a day, and some OTC pills that are supposed to relieve stress.

Monday while I was working I felt like my throat was closing up so I went to the ER, while there I told them about my issue with the pains. They did an EKG and a chest xray. Along with a swab for strep. EKG and Xray both looked normal according to the doctor (I never got to see the xrays). They told me they also thought it was probably just anxiety and gave me a one time prescription of some anti anxiety pills to take when needed.

&#x200B;

**Medicine**:I've been taking ibuprofen when needed, I tried to do the 600MG four times a day, but I can't swallow pills and chewing them was making me feel worse. So I've been taking some chewable childrens ibuprofen as needed. I've been taking the stress relief tablets once or twice a day. I've also been taking some antacid chews as I've been told some of my symptoms could be from GERD and I have other things going on that match it. I've only taken the anti-anxiety pills once so far, because they put me to sleep pretty quickly and I work around ovens and fryers, so I need to be aware at all times.

Edit: Something to add is when I wake up in the morning I typically feel fine without the pain at first and it comes on later in the day. I noticed today while working it got worse and more often the more i moved around and did things, but on a normal day I can go on walks and stuff and be just fine. 

It is also probably worth noting due to extreme heat in my area the past few weeks, I've mostly sat in my dorm on my bed when not in class or working. Obviously not a good thing and something I plan on changing with the cooling temps.

Really anything would be helpful at this point. I am terrified I am going to die, but everyone else just seems to laugh it off or blame it on anxiety."

"Severe chest pain no diagnosis, GERD or anxiety?","Hello, I'm a 28 Female, 5'5, 155lbs, Caucasian. No known illnesses. I go to the gym 5x a week and eat a pretty clean diet. I've had chronic chest pains near my heart for the past week. Deep, burning, heavy pain. Sometimes radiates to the upper left side of my back. If I focus too much on it the pain becomes very sharp. I've had an EKG done, blood work, thyroid checked, and a chest x-ray and doctors cannot figure out the cause of the pain. I suffer from pretty bad acid reflux, could this be related? I've never had this new form of pain, and it triggers my anxiety into thinking I'm having a heart attack. Maybe they missed something on the EKG? I was prescribed Citalopram for anxiety and depression which I'm hoping will stop the panic I feel when the pain gets bad. I was given muscle relaxers after my EKG in the case that its muscle spasms I'm having. They help a bit but do not stop these flare ups. Zantac 150 doesn't seem to help except maybe a tiny bit. Does anyone else experience these horrible chest pains?"

severe joint pain,"21F, 5’2”, 220 lb Southern indiana, usa 

been having joint pain, specifically in my si joints, since february. i’ve done physical therapy and all the stretches at home. i’ve also tried two different anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac and meloxicam), as well as oral prenisone, none of which helps much. i also have a TENS unit & heating pad per my PCP’s orders. they help to an extent, but as soon as i take it off, the pain comes back. she had me to go the Orthopedic dr & he didn’t listen to me at all. he did an x-ray on my back & even after i told him i don’t have back pains, that it’s my joints, he told me that 1) there’s nothing wrong with my back, 2) i’m too young to be dealing with joint pain, and 3) to exercise and lose weight. (i can’t really lose weight and work out until i’m not in pain soooo) 

anyway, i came back to PCP, still in pain, and so she ordered blood tests to screen for inflammation and autoimmune diseases. she also put in a referral for another appointment at ortho with a different dr. 

i got my blood drawn today, and since i went to the hospital outpatient services, i got my results back already. 

high levels of C-reactive protein (it’s 1.7 and should be between 0.0-0.5) and high levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (it’s 33 and should be between 0-22) 

i know this means i have inflammation, but i want to know what else this means or what to do next. my dr isn’t open until monday and the suspense is going to kill me.

edit: i do have depression, anxiety, iron deficiency anemia, and i feel like i get butterfly rashes occasionally. my face is always red and blushed, and it’s also very dry, but sometimes it will get red and hot towards the front of my face/on my cheekbones, whereas the normal redness is always more along my jawline and near my ears on my cheeks) i also have what looks like keratosis pilaris on my arms and outer thighs. i also have fibroadenomas in both breasts. idk if any of that will help but that’s everything else that’s wrong with me."

I have what I suspect could be an umbilical hernia. It is a soft spot just under my belly button. It bulges slightly and when compressed will flatten out, remaining soft though. It is also quite uncomfortable to pressure or knocks, like my infant children kicking it.

   This spot is also nowhere near the 5 cuts made for my Gastric surgery.

Possible Laryngitis or URTI?,"22F

This feels like a pretty google-able question, but I can’t find anything online that matches all my symptoms. The past two days I’ve woken up needing my inhaler (I could breathe shallow breaths, but I couldn’t take any deep breaths before using it). I thought this was just my allergies acting up a bit, but now my throat is extremely sore and I think I might be sick with something. I don’t have a fever (98.6 F) and I don’t have a stuffy or runny nose, but my voice has been hoarse. I also have sneezed a few times and I have been coughing a bit, but none of my coughs seem productive — they are pretty dry and painful. I have only felt a little phlegm in my throat, but nothing excessive. Swallowing is a little difficult, so there might be some inflammation, but it’s not that bad and I’ve definitely experienced worse.

When looking up my symptoms I’ve settled on either an upper respiratory infection or maybe laryngitis. The only problem is I don’t have any congestion or a fever. I suffer from pretty bad allergies and I take levociterizine and montelukast everyday, so maybe those have decongested me and that’s why I don’t have congestion as a symptom?

The only thing that has helped me today is drinking hot tea. And other than my throat hurting and some coughing, I feel pretty normal.

Any advice on what this could be or what I can do to try and get rid of it would be greatly appreciated. I would usually just try and get through it without much intervention, but I start my new job on Wednesday and I would really like to make a good first impression rather than disgust everyone with my sickness.

Smoking status: cannabis 1-2x weekly (last 6 months)

Previous and current medical issues: amputated thumb, boxer fracture both on right hand

Duration and location of complaint: predominately right hand.

I crack my knuckles regularly most days once an hour or more, but then there are spurts of time, sometimes longer than two weeks where I'll crack my knuckles almost every 30-s. It will go on for several weeks at least (I haven't been keeping count), eventually my knuckles are really swollen, almost painful, and it feels like the urge to crack them is totally uncontrollable. Some background, I've had two traumatic injuries to my hand (right) - the knuckle cracking is on both hands for clarification, haven't taken data on which hand I crack more but I feel like it's my right. The traumatic injuries include a boxers fracture from punching a door when I was in High School and losing half of my thumb to amputation in a boating accident. I spoke to an orthopedic surgeon about this when I was in High School or College and he said it was behavioral and that the most that I could do is take steamy showers to relieve the discomfort or use a hot towel coupled with icy hot or similar. I'm now 32 and I'm taking a second look at this.

Do you have any thoughts? I'm interested to know whether it's actually completely behavioral."

My 4 year old has been having bowel issues for a long time now, right after the time she was fully potty trained. She has constipation where it’s not that she’s not pooping everyday, but her poop comes out in small pieces that are for the most part pretty hard, or she will poop multiple times a day sometimes large ones but it will come out lumpy or hardened. She has on and off belly pain but thankfully for the most part it isn’t something she complains of everyday. However, she seems to have bowel urgency or the feeling of not completely emptying the bowels. She woke up in the middle of the night this week with an urgent need to poop but nothing came out. A few weeks ago she had a random week long bout of diarrhea that was extremely mucousy; I should add I see white mucus mixed in with her poops sometimes and when wiping. 

I’m waiting on an appt with her pedi who will probably test her stool and draw some labs but I am looking for advice in the mean time. I’m nervous as some internet searching has come up with some scary results (bowel cancer) and I’m at a loss on what’s going on."

(Including dinner), I had ~4 oz of steak, a pint of vegetable pasta salad, two very spicy cream cheese filled roasted jalapeños, and a couple handfuls of Cheetos. More than I would normally eat for an average dinner, but definitely not the most I’ve eaten. Wouldn’t consider it in the thanksgiving-meal type range. 

This morning I woke up feeling extremely nauseous and bloated. I couldn’t believe it - looked in the mirror and looked nine months pregnant. My stomach was completed distended. 

I drank coffee and hot tea throughout the day thinking that’d help with digestion. Nope. 
I’ve been burping all day long and my stomach is not going down. I still feel very full and have no appetite. Thinking a small snack might help with my metabolism, I had some seeds and almonds. That didn’t help either. 

It seems like it’s all sitting high in my stomach, like it hasn’t gone through my digestion track an inch. I’m STILL BURPING the food I ate last night, 24 hours later. And I still look pregnant.

Why am I gaining weight on this amount of food? I exercise at least 90 minutes a day and my TDEE is supposed to be 2600. I used to do 2.5 hours a day but cut down because of stress on my joints. Yet I'm somehow gaining on 1800. Should I go back down to 1600 or less so my body adjusts better? 

My diet is vegan and I'm very careful to make sure I get correct portions. Everything is planned and weighed out. I eat mostly vegetables, brown rice, beans, nuts and fruit. I supplement everything as well. My digestive system is still trying to recover from starving and I look and feel bloated all the time, yet I have this extreme urge to gorge on food and it takes everything in me to resist it.

Current medications (if any): None

Approximately 2 months ago, I had a medical exam for a fire department. I had a cardio stress test, a couple ECGs, and a chest xray among several other tests. I was told I was in perfect health and even exceeded their standards with a ""perfectly strong heart"". I run around 6 miles a week and weight lift 6 days a week. A few days after the medical exam, I started to notice my temporal arteries pulsing, which I have never noticed before. Along with being able to hear my pulse in my right ear, occasionally both ears, when I lay down at night. Sometimes, I don't hear it at all. 

I began checking my blood pressure religiously, thinking it might just be high (despite being perfect during my medical exam) and causing these issues. My BP was elevated at times and outstanding at others, nerves are definitely a factor. But I began lowering my sodium intake, upping my potassium intake, and limiting my caffeine. I ended up going to my PCP and explaining everything to him just to make sure everything is fine. He listened to my heart, took my vitals, and told me it's stress and anxiety. I didn't argue with him but I left there not feeling any better about what was going. I figured he might want to at least trying to do some sort of testing but nope. 

Now, as of a week ago, I noticed that my diastolic pressure has dropped from being around 80 at all times, to the low 60's to sometimes low 70's. I've also began experiencing what I believe is some kind of chest discomfort, not necessarily pain or tightness, but as if I've become hyper aware of my heart beating and like I have a itch or a cough building up in my upper ABD. My pulse rate and quality are fine.

I definitely feel stressed out and anxious about what's going on with me but could it all be me just overthinking everything and anxiety just causing all of this? Should I bother seeing a cardiologist?"

———

Hi there. USA. My husband is 33yo Native American male 5’10” weighing 312lbs. He has Glioblastoma diagnosed 2/14/19, partial resection brain surgery, and then he had pulmonary embolisms in both lungs diagnosed 3/30/19. Radiation was April through May. He is on daily Keppra and Pradaxa morning and night. 

At the beginnings of each month he does 5 days of Telemolozide aka Temodar (I’m sure I butchered the name - it’s the type of Chemo of Glioblastoma.) and honestly his white counts have been pretty good. On chemo days he also takes Pepcid, Tums, Zofran, and/or Pepto Bismol. (Not all four at once, just one or two.) He stopped taking Decadron steroids 9/22/19 after loooooong and difficult tapering and lots of withdrawals, which he believes he still may be feeling the effects of. 

Okay, anyway. That is is long health history. He is on day 2 of a 5-day chemo round right now. He says that he feels like a cold might be coming on. (Edit: he doesn’t have a fever, he is hovering around 98°F) He feels nasal congestion, and sinus ache behind the eyes. He is very scared. Yes it’s just a cold, but he’s on chemo, has cancer, and is still healing from the pulmonary embolisms. He is scared that even something as simple as a cold might be enough to hospitalize him, or worse. He’s very scared.

>**TL;DR (understandable):** I told him it will be okay and just to relax. But then I turned to the internet because I want to know - Is this a big deal? Could getting a cold 6 months after PE’s be super dangerous? Does chemo make getting a cold worse? Do those two things combined make it worse???

His doctors and nurses don’t answer their phones on the weekends. We don’t like to go to the ER “just to be safe” for a number of valid reasons. One is that the ER people tend to flip out and do unnecessary CT scans on him, which his doctor has told him to avoid. Another is that the ER people see all the messed up stuff in his head on the CT scan, and immediately shoot him full of steroids. NO!!! It takes soooo freaking long to taper off these, and his doctor strongly wants him OFF steroids. Last time he struggled for 4 months to get off them, the ER staff shot him full of 12mg and it took us 5 months to taper him back down. The ER staff never seems to understand that we aren’t there for them to treat his brain issues with steroids. We’re there for breathing issues or whatever separate issue we came in for. We also have had problems where in the ER they don’t let him take his Keppra and Pradaxa. He needs it twice a day and they’ve kept him there 30 hours before with no meds despite me basically crying and begging saying he needs it. (His doctor was furious when she heard about this.) Anyway it’s crucial stay away from the ER as much as we can, and his doctor doesn’t want him in situations where he’s getting shot up with steroids, given unnecessary CT scans, or having his medication withheld. So the ER is a major no go zone for us unless it’s literally an emergency. No “just in case.” We have also been told not to bother with urgent care because they’re not equipped to handle someone with all his health problems, so they always just send us to the ER right away if we go there. 

So we can’t call his doctor/nurses, and since we can’t do ER or urgent care, I am hoping I can turn to reddit:

Background: 39 Male. No meds, NKDA, Hx of one run of A-fib that self converted after I got frustrated and whacked myself in the sternum. Probably hypertensive. I'm a fairly active distance runner and I both run several miles at a time and workout with bodyweight exercises 5-6 times per week. Ht 6'1'' Wt 235lbs

I throw PVCs like nobody's business. Lot of them. Mostly unifocal, sometimes not. Occasional couplets or triplets. I've never caught a run of V-tach but I assume I've had it. Mostly I throw 15-30 PVCs per minute and I live in bigeminy. Constant palpitations, occasional momentary dizziness. I'd say I'm more tired than I feel I should be but I work 80 to 90hrs per week on 24 and 12hr shifts and have two teenagers, one with high-demand behavioral special needs.

My resting heart rate hovers around 60bpm but is regularly in the 50s. This is when I throw most of my PVCs. With activity that gets my rate up I never have any issues and can run a rate of 160-170 for an hour if I am running distance. A normal daily run for me is 3-5mi at speed.

I have caught 1 run of a-fib and I knew I was in it by symptoms before I put myself on a monitor. I have access to one and all I ever catch is the PVCs when I wire myself up. The rest I feel via palpitations or pulse checks.

I've always assumed that the treatments would have intolerable side effects and that the PVCs are simply benign... but I'm on duty today and am getting lightheadded and am wanting another opinion on that."
Random but frequent nausea and vomiting + other symptoms,"Last week I had 600MG of caffeine which I believe upset my stomach really badly and resulted in me throwing up for 12+ hours straight (I have no idea if it was actually the caffeine, but it is the only thing that could have caused it aside from the flu, which I had no symptoms for). I was fine the next day, but the day after that I vomited twice more about 6 hours apart and had persistent nausea. The day after that I continued in vomit two or three more times that day with really awful nausea. I have been fine for most of this week, but I just began throwing up again.

I have gone to the doctors for other mild health issues such as: weight gain, extreme fatigue, terrible cold sores, easy bruising, poor circulation, and hair loss.

I have no idea if the vomiting is a big deal or if there is any sort of connection between that and my other health issues, but I'm grasping for straws at this point. I have not felt like the old, healthier version of myself in a long, long time.

I am an 18-year-old female and I am 5'3 and 150 pounds. I walk 10+ miles a day because of my large college campus and eat a typical diet (not insanely healthy, but not awful). I consider myself to be relatively active. I am from the United States. I am a responsible drinker and never drink past my limits (I've never passed out or blacked out) and drink semi-frequently. I do not smoke. 

I take 20mg of Lexapro and have been diagnosed with depression, OCD, and PTSD and had spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis 6 years ago.

I am making a doctor's appointment next time I go home, but I'm looking to see if anything here is suspicious, or if I just have a really sensitive stomach.

Can untreated bursitis cause permanent damage?,"19F here. 5'3, about 140 lbs, never smoked. The only medication I take is the occasional ibuprofen. While I was at military school about two years ago, a doctor there diagnosed me with pes anserine bursitis in my right knee. He told me that usually physical therapy would be the solution, but since I was at military school, it was not an option, so I was just instructed to use an ice pack on it at lunch every day. There was very heavy physical activity every day there, for six months, and I was only allowed a day or two after diagnosis of a break from that for my knee. Multiple times while we were running my knee would give way and I would stumble or fall, and it hurt a lot/felt very weird. After graduating my right knee would still give me trouble occasionally, feeling painful and a bit weaker than my left knee. Lately my job (12 hour shift, standing 98% of the day) has been causing a fair bit of pain in that knee too, and only that knee. Would my former bursitis have anything to do with the problems I've had from that particular knee, or am I crazy?"

In april i was prescribed duloxetine (brand name cymbalta). Back then, i was diagnosed with depression. Shortly after going on it at a low dose, i started to experience symptoms of psychosis (and extreme erratic mood swings) however my provider refused to take me off of it.  Around may my symptoms were at an all time high, i basically had no control over any of my actions and was on a very long self harm streak, randomly doing things like pulling at my hair, screaming out of nowhere, smashing my head into walls or very suddenly thrashing it around (all emotion induced, normally from having an intrusive memory) and it got to the point where i was sent to an inpatient facility where i was weaned off of it as quickly as possible and started on lamotrigine (brand name lamictal) and my diagnosis was changed to severe bipolar with psychotic features. Despite not being on cymbalta anymore, i still have these symptoms mentioned before at the same magnitude. Is this normal?"

"My family is pretty sure my dad is chronically sick (cancer, cirrhosis, idk) but he absolutely will not talk to us about it. Previous smoker, lifelong alcoholic. While wasted today he revealed he needs to take 5000 IU daily of D3. Does that give any hint of what might be going on?","He's 76, male, around six feet, not overweight, Caucasian. 
He's never taken care of himself, almost never goes out, doesn't exercise, gets most of his calories from beer, gets at a minimum drunk every single night before he sleeps at 6PM. He quit smoking about 5 years ago.

The past 2-3 years he's really really gone downhill. I'm sure some of it is just age, but he looks older, he gets angry much faster, he gets drunker, he has no energy. He also has to pee constantly (again, hard to tell what's just aging). He just doesn't look or seem well, moreso than he should. 

But the thing that's concerning about it, and has us worried something specific is wrong, is that whenever we try to talk to him about it, he *absolutely* and unmovingly clams up about it. It started out as just 'hey you should get a checkup', but his absolute refusal has ratcheted this up more and more. We've tried everything from doing it in public to a private one-on-one with me opening up my heart to him. Not a single word. He doesn't even say he's fine, he just literally stops talking and will actually leave if we keep going. 

This all sounds very negative about him, but I want to be clear, he *is* a good guy overall, and I love him, and I know he loves me.


Today he was absolutely toasted, and since I guess he wasn't thinking he drunkenly asked me if the D3 vitamins he bought were 5,000 IU since that's what he needs. I asked him what they were for, and he instantly went into the clam up mode - so it's pretty obvious this has to do with it. 

Does that give *any* hint to anyone what the issue might be? Can anyone even give me any ideas of a body part or *anything*? Anything that could help at all. 

He hasn't seen a doctor in a decade (again, absolute refusal), so whatever reason he's taking it he probably read on the internet. 

I know I've written a lot, so I truly appreciate that you've read this far. Thank you."

 I had a horrible, round, under the skin spot growing on my temple for about a week. It wasn't going down so I stupidly (and unsuccessfully) tried to pop it. I thought I felt it rupture, so stopped squeezing, but wasn't sure. 24hours later, my face has started to swell, to one side of the spot (towards my eye), and it incredibly painful. The spot itself has gone down, but surrounding skin is still swelling. Is this something that's likely to go down on it's own, or should I seek medical attention? I'm just quite concerned that it's very close to my eye. Thank you for any advice!!

"30M, Might have gotten tiny bit of household cleaning product in eye.","Two  days ago I was cleaning my bathroom using Vim Activfizz Cleaner (the label says it contains ethoxylated alcohol C9-C11). I sprayed it on a cloth a  few times, and then as I was bending over, I guess there was a bit of a ""mist"" from it left in the air because I felt a very slight burning sensation in one eye even though I didn't feel anything hit it. The sensation went away really fast, barely a second, but just for good measures I went over to the sink to rinse my eye out a good few times. Everything seemed fine, so I went back to cleaning, but after I was finished cleaning I read on the product label that it may irritate eyes and in the event of eye contact you should rinse the eye for 10 minutes. I didn't do it for anywhere near that long. At the  time I just figured because the amount was so small if anything, and it didn't burn any more it must be okay.

I haven't had any eye discomfort or changes in vision over the last two days since this happened. But should I still see a doctor? If it did make sufficient contact with my eye and I didn't rinse the eye for long enough, could it still be doing damage even though I don't feel anything?

Hi, I’m posting here because I’m currently unable to get to a doctor for 2 weeks and would also like to know what to say to my doctor when I do go.

So around this time last year (Nov-Dec 2018) I started feeling really nauseous and feeling like I needed to burp and/or throw up I can’t remember exactly what ended up happening but basically the doctor sent me to have a few tests, a blood test and ultrasound on my stomach (everything was fine if I remember correctly) then he asked me to go and have a colonoscopy and endoscopy to see if they could find any polyps or ulcers or anything like that, by this time the symptoms I had were almost completely gone I think he also had me on meds for reflux or something (can’t really remember) but by the time he asked me to have the colonoscopy/endoscopy I felt better and wasn’t comfortable with the idea of having it done the thought of it alone is uncomfortable to me.

Anyway almost a year later and the same sort of symptoms have returned I am currently nauseous and sort of “dizzy” for lack of a better word and I still have reflux which I have had for years, when my nausea gets really bad I force myself to sleep just so I can be numb and this nauseous feeling is affecting my whole lifestyle I don’t feel like exercising which I need to do as I am overweight, any help is appreciated and any further details you would like to know just ask me and I will be able to help.

How can I stop getting sick every time I have a day off after exhausting myself?,"Relevant information: 20F, 160cm 52kg.

Medicated with an SNRI (cymbalta) and melatonin (when necessary). No (known) allergies/intolerances. Vaccinated. Had lyme disease as a kid. No exercise outside of my everyday walking, which adds up since I walk our dog a lot and the bus is 1km away. 

So the issue. I get sick a lot, sick as in I get a cold, a sore throat, I get a ""burpy"" feeling high up in my stomach connected to the sore throat, and it's a sensation that is not relieved by cough syrup or honey. Swallowing saliva causes nausea. 

These are the symptoms I get, they are exactly the same every time and I get them in correlation to exhausting myself, mentally, physically, often a combination of both. Stress is almost always involved. For example I got sick a lot when I worked in fast food, after I quit it took very long to recover. I went to test-work for a cafe after an interview and fell ill like this the day after. Currently I am feeling early symptoms, and yesterday I had my first shift at my new gig.

I will be working a LOT in the upcoming weeks, which worries me. I can't get sick right now, there's no way. The work I'll be doing is physically exhausting but something I absolutely love doing, and I'm afraid my body will break down the second I get a day off. (I usually get sick when I start relaxing). 

I have a history of getting a nasty cold the first week of summer break for example, when I lower my guard and relax after a stressful school year.

Hey everyone. I have a few questions, and maybe I just need some reassurance. I don't know, but here's a background/timeline:

Two weeks ago: Started noticing some dull testicular pain that got worse toward the end of the day, especially when lying down. Felt like it was in my right testicle, but the pain became more general. Nothing felt abnormal, and no lumps that I could tell. Went to the ER late that night. They did an ultrasound, CT scan, urine, and general bloodwork. All came back normal. They suggested I take an anti-inflammatory and referred me to a urologist.

Several days later: I see the urologist, he checks me physically but says he can't feel any abnormalities. Says it might just be pain that comes and goes. Prescribes me a more powerful anti-inflammatory and says to call back if it gets worse or doesn't get better.

A few days after that: Pain seems to be improving slightly, but is now definitely localized and coming from my right testicle. I'm also starting to notice lower back pain that gets worse when sitting or laying down. I call the urologist back, and he suggests I seek a second opinion because there's nothing more he can do.

Last weekend: Doing a self exam again, feel a small (maybe 2-3mm, grain of rice?) firm bump on top of my right testicle. So close to the epididymis that I can't really tell whether it's on it or the testicle. I can't really seem to move it, but the lump itself is painless. When I move the epididymis toward the bump it seems to disappear, and when I move it away it's more pronounced. This is where I really start to worry.

Wednesday: I see my second opinion urologist. Tell him about the bump. He says ""it doesn't feel immediately concerning to him, but to continue to monitor it every day"". Says the ultrasound/CT from 10 days prior seemed fine, and that he would order an MRI to be sure.

That's where I am now. The pain in my testicle has resolved itself to a dull ache that's not as unbearable as it was. The bump doesn't seem to be changing, but my lower back still hurts and everything is only mildly improved by the anti-inflammatory. Waiting on the MRI (4 days from now, followed by another urologist appointment the week after) and both me and my SO are worried. Worried that they missed something on the ultrasound, worried that because the first results were clear that no one is taking this bump seriously, worried that the back pain is related. Anyone have any advice/input? My already not-great medical anxiety is kind of off the charts right now (I know I'm probably being paranoid)."
I think I have a chalazion - Male 26 years old,So I have this bump in my eyelid right below my tear duct. It's about the size of a pea and no matter how many times I press it with a warm compress it doesn't go away. It's definitely not a stye as it's been there for almost two years. So my question is what kind of doctor do I see to have this removed? Should I see a dermatologist or an optometrist?

I had a wedge resection treatment done a week ago. The black color is from a caustic agent the doctor applied to kill the nerve in the mail bed to prevent the mail from growing back. 

I'm just curious how the healing process looks. I am on Doxycycline, and cleaning it twice a day with alcohol and or Epsom salt soak. I am alternating Bactrim and Neosporin when changing bandage. 

It is infected. There is a small amount of pus coming from the corner nail bed where the nail was removed. 

I think it looks better. I am just concerned about the redness. It isn't terribly sore either. Is there anyway I can hasten the healing process? I am ridiculously concerned over this."

Trying to see options with food allergies,"Basically since I was young I've always had a weird relationship with food.

From roughly ages 10-16 I was lactose intolerant.   

After 20 I started noticing my mouth getting itchy after eating nuts, this developed into an allergy that I now carry an epi-pen on me.  

A bit after developing a peanut allergy it turned into all tree nuts as well.  

A couple of years ago I noticed that I can no longer eat sunflower seeds due to itching/swelling.  

I've got oral allergy syndrome, the first signs of this for me were probably around 16 trying coconut, but nothing really noticeable until 18-20 years old. Almost all fruit skins give me an itchy mouth and slight throat swelling.  

Just a couple days ago I feel like I may have discovered that I might have an allergy to chia seeds as well. Twice now I have eaten them and thrown up 5-6 hours later.  

  

I guess basically what I'm trying to find out is if there is anything I can be doing to prevent more food allergies, or just something I guess. I'm really not trying to slowly develop allergies to everything. I've been to an allergist, and all they can really do is a scratch test, where I'm just allergic to the entire world basically haha. Any advice or insight into this would be really appreciated, or even pointing in a direction of someone I can talk to about it.

The last time I've been tested for diabetes was over a year ago (negative), but due to my unhealthy eating habits over the past stressful year (e.g. eating 500g of Nutella and 400g of bread in just one day, or 400g of nuts, and more), I fear I may have developed (pre-)diabetes (I gained at least 2 kg over that year).

I've had a blood screening yesterday and everything was fine, only I was following a very low carb diet, meaning I had been eating little to no carbohydrates at all. Today, due to gallbladder issues, I had to cut fats and started eating carbs again.

"52M - Broken finger not healing after 6 weeks, 2nd opinion?","Hi,

I fractured the ""distal phalanx"" on my ring finger 6 weeks ago. After X-Rays I consulted a local Orthopaedic Surgeon who commented it was a bad fracture. Specifically it was broken in two places in different axises, across the base of the bone it was split  inline with the fingers and above that across the bone. Like this...

Side view:

Fingertip

||

Middle Phalanx

Palm facing View

&#x200B;

The surgeon told me surgery was inadvisable, due to the bone fragments being small and asked me to wear a finger cast and come back in 4  weeks.

4 weeks later X-rays showed the bottom fracture was healing but the top one showed no signs of the bone ""bridging the gap"", I'm in the process of waiting another 4 weeks in a cast but can't detect any progress, very gentle pressure in the fingertip still shows instability.  


Questions:  


Is any damage being done by waiting further (Dr says no).  


Should I seek a 2nd surgical opinion? This guy seems very good but I admit I'm starting to become concerned.  


Many Thanks!"
"I have 30% foetal haemoglobin, which has a higher oxygen affinity. How would this affect my body?","I have a combination of beta thalassemia minor and hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin (HPFH). 

If I understand correctly, adult haemoglobin is made of two alpha and two beta proteins. The thalassemia means I don't produce enough of the beta haemoglobin protein, which means the amounts of alpha & beta proteins produced don't match up, and haemoglobin production isn't efficient.

Foetal haemoglobin is made from two alpha proteins (the same as adult haemoglobin), and two *gamma* proteins instead of the beta proteins that adult haemoglobin has. Normally the body stops producing gamma proteins in the few months after birth, but with HPFH production persists into adulthood leading to about 10% foetal haemoglobin. 

But since I have beta-thalassemia minor *and* HPFH, the gamma protein production is somehow up-regulated to ""pick up the slack"" from the poor beta protein production, resulting in 30% foetal haemoglobin. 

Now in the womb, in order for the baby to get oxygen from the mother, foetal haemoglobin is required because it holds oxygen more tightly than adult haemoglobin, such that in the placenta the oxygen transfers from the mother's adult haemoglobin to the baby's foetal haemoglobin. 

So finally onto my questions... How is 30% foetal haemoglobin, with higher oxygen affinity, likely to affect my body? Perhaps:

1. Maybe the blood simply returns to my lungs with more oxygen left over?
2. Maybe some organs are able to extract oxygen from haemoglobin more effectively than other organs, leaving them with *more* oxygen than would otherwise be available?
3. Maybe some organs receive the oxygenated blood *first*, and other organs down-the-chain have less available oxygen?
4. Maybe some organs have permanently adapted to less oxygen availability? E.g. less muscle mass overall?
5. Anything else?

These questions really interest me, but I wouldn't even know where to start researching them. If anyone could provide any insight at all I would be very grateful!

Many thanks

Is my scab infected?,"Hi,

About a week ago, I got a cut on my hand that was bleeding for a bit. It’s been a week now and this is what it looks like:


https://imgur.com/gallery/tsVnHlg


It’s quite itchy and has skin peeling around it making a sort of discolored ring. I don’t think I have a fever, so that is a good sign, but I just want to make sure it isn’t anything to freak out about.

General info: 21M, 5’9’’, 150 lbs, white, no pre-existing conditions, and am currently taking accutane"
"23M Haven't been able to have sex in 7 MONTHS due to torn frenulum. Doctors say to wait more, but it's ruining my relationship!","Was kindly directed here from another thread...

As the title suggests, it has been a difficult year with tearing my frenulum earlier this year. It's seriously negatively affecting my relationship that we have both been unable to be physically active for so long. (She won't let me satisfy her if she can't do me it seems)

Today we gave it a shot after 7 months of not trying and the wound started bleeding again. Now I'm worried I've reversed 7 months of healing. What open wound doesn't heal after half a year? Feel like I seriously need some help.

I have tried both keeping the area dry and applying Neosporin regularly. 

After 7 months I found improvements, however we only tried today since I no longer felt irritation. If I can't trust my own body, how will I ever know it's healed?"
Does this look like Melanoma? 21M 170 lbs,"Hello Everyone,

Today in the shower, I noticed this black spot in the back of my shoulder. It looks like a mole but I am worried it is Melanoma. I went to the dermatologist yesterday to take a look at this black spot on my hand that was removed and later sent for a Biopsy.  The dermatologist also did a full skin scan, so I imagine he found this spot and did not find it to be a concern. From what you see of it, does it look like Melanoma or more of a mole/freckle

Very sharp pain when eating sometimes in the upper-behind-mouth area,"M17 5'8 somewhere around 120 lbs i think (im smol) . No past medical issues

This happens rarely, but it it is very odd. Sometimes when I begin to eat a food, a sharp pain will start to arise right in the area before my throat but kind of in my mouth. The best I can explain it is how your mouth feels right at the ""peak"" of a swallow. Right at the behind-roof of my mouth.

It will then die down if I stop eating, and then I'll be fine. It is very painful if I continue to eat for any amount of time, I have to stop to let it go away first.

I don't think the choice of food matters. I've had it happen with a bagel, sandwich, pizza rolls (they're soft and small), etc.

Not sure what it could be. Perhaps some sort of allergic reaction?"
"Is this a legit diagnosis, or are these guys deceiving us? Pyramid scheme?","My mom suspected that me or my brother may have some parasites. She found some type of little black thingy moving around the bathroom a few times. So originally she was gonna test our faeces to see if we had any parasites, but a college at work (medical professor) told her about this blood testing. She said that they can see parasites in blood along side many other things that would not be seen in taking a test in a doctors office. (The guy that was the translator said this, he said that at the doctors office they just look at 30x magnification and that here its 1650x). Also she said that many of her students were wanting to do this, she gets a commission for this, she said.

Okay so my mom took me and my brother to a apartment in whitch a russian (female) doctor uses a microscope to look at blood cells. There was a guy that was acting as a translator,he stays here while the doctor travles. So after the doctor took my blood and put it under the microscope it was displayed on a television screen. After she put it under the microscope she gave me a glass of water from a bottle that had a mineral stone inside, i drank it. Cholesterol,palm oil,parasites, thick blood and liver problems. Thats what they said they saw in my blood. After that they pierced my finger again and took the blood, and it was better cause of the water they gave me (they sell the water with the minerals).
The found coca cola in my brothers blood... it was black spots displayed on the screen.

He went of to tell us that he has different programs offerd at about 150 euro a month, that where supposed to fix us up in about 3-4 months. Also he said that if my mom recruites anyone she would get a commission. At the end, my mom payed him 100 euros of the blood test for 3 of us. She didnt buy any of the programs or the water yet.

My question is if any of this is legit, im pretty sketched out of this situation but im not sure of anything. Can theese things be determined from a blood test?

However as I got older it started happening more frequently and for longer periods of time. I now spend about 75% of my life feeling as if nothing is real. The logical side of me knows this isn’t the case. But there’s a big part of me that has been starting to question my logical side more and more. I’m not suicidal but often times I’ll have these urges to drive my car off the road or to jump off my balcony because I feel as if I won’t get hurt. I don’t act on these urges and I have no plan to but it’s a whole new level of invasive thoughts. I’ve vaguely mentioned this to my boyfriend, just that sometimes i feel like I’m dreaming and nothing is real and he tells me it is all real. He thinks I’m joking but he doesn’t know the severity of it. I don’t want to tell him because he is already so good with my anxiety and being patient with me. This isn’t affecting my work or friendships but it’s causing me a lot of stress as it progresses. Its uncomfortable."
Causes of Lower Abdominal Pain in a Woman?,"I am a 28 year old female, 5 foot 7 inches, 115 pounds and Caucasian. I live a healthy lifestyle and eat plant based and get activity 4-5 times a week. I rarely get sick. 

For the past two days, I have been experiencing a constant pain in my lower abdominal area whenever I stand up or walk. I haven’t noticed any other symptoms and overall, everything else feels healthy. 

My period tracker indicates that I am currently ovulating, I’m not sure if that would cause this type of pain. I did a circuit workout on two days during the day, but didn’t feel like I pulled a muscle or anything and this type of pain doesn’t really feel like a pulled muscle. In terms of digestion, I have very regular bowel movements and have never had any digestive issues, so I doubt that would be a cause.

Does anyone know of what might cause this type of pain and whether it would worthwhile to get it checked out? Does it sound like something serious?"

Hand and ankle injury for a year. Please help,"It's been the most challenging year for my husband and I. March 2019, husband (22M 150 lb 6'0) used power tools. After that, his wrists hurt like a bitch. 2 months later, he stepped wrong while running and both his ankles also hurt. They have been hurting like crazy since then. For several months he's been doing all the ankle stretches they suggested with no results. They've done Cortisol injection for carpal tunnel in the wrists with no results, and they did another injection a month ago for tendinitis in his thumb with no results. He's a runner and a climber - having these issues at 22 has completely sent him into depression and he cannot go to school or get a job because it hurts to walk more than a block and he cannot write or type for very long. Even worse, he just hurt his hip from overstretching so biking hurts now, too.

Pain after shock,"14M, 5'11, 184 pounds, white

I was unplugging a standard computer power cord from an outlet to the left of my desk, where there is little clearance for a cable.The cable was not coming out, and was half-unplugged. Tired and not thinking straight, I grabbed the top left prong with my left ring finger, stayed locked for a second, and then let go. The outlet was I believe 120v, but my house is old, and my room has had electrical problems before. My finger tingled like crazy and cramped while getting shocked, and then cramped after I let go. This happened at about 11:37 AM. Throughout the day, my finger has been very sore and loose. It is 7:27 at the time of writing this. My finger feels just as sore as it did the moment I let go of the prong. My finger is about three times looser than normal. Am I ok to just take some ibuprofen and get a good night's sleep, or should I go see my doctor? Thanks."

Pain at night that is only relieved by pressure. Doctor said he never heard of anything like it.,"•Female, 35, 5’2” 120 lbs.

•Autistic with hyper mobility but no other symptoms of Ehler-Danlos. 

•Idiopathic hypersomnia that I take vyvanse for. 

Since my twenties about once a year I have this strange pain in middle of the night that is only relieved by pressure. It has gotten more common and this last week happened several nights in a row.  It had happened a few times in afternoon/evening but is almost always in middle of night.

Usually it is most prevalent in my inner elbows and behind my knees. I have to keep pushing and pressuring those spots til the pain goes away, usually after a few hours.

I have looked at illustrations of fibromyalgia trigger points and it overlaps with them but I have no other symptoms of fibromyalgia and the pain is never caused by pressure but RELIEVED by it.

On the worst occasions the pain has been so bad I had to tie my body with scarves as tightly as I possibly could and even then laying there writhing in pain til it passed.

On those really bad occasions the most painful spots were inner elbows, backs of knees, behind shoulders, and small of back above my butt, all “trigger points” of fibromyalgia.

Neurologist - Is this ALS?,"Neurologists - any idea what’s going on here?

I am 26 and have had BFS since May. It all began around January of this year I was twitching in every muscle. To be clear, I have had some very “quiet” days sometimes consecutive. FWIW haven’t twitched in a few days. On the other hand some days, especially early on hundreds of twitchers I could feel. None that I couldn’t. Without an EMG, this lead to a BFS diagnosis after blood teats and routine labs were done to check for obvious imbalances. All was good, and the doctor wasn’t concerned. He spent sometime with me offered some solutions, but his general tone was that you may have this for eternity and that’s ok.

Around the same time, (and I’m not sure if it’s related, that’s why I want your opinion) my ring and pinky, on the left hand began seeming off, just off... That’s really all I can say to describe it. Fine movements are a bit challenging, like holding remotes, flashlights, even pens, and manipulating them is difficult. please keep in mind this has absolutely to do with being the dominant hand or not.
Arm movement is still fine and I am active both in handy things around the house and physical fitness. I haven’t not found a body weight movement or weightlifting movement I cannot do or even have trouble with.
It’s really just the smaller fine movements I have challenged with.

I followed up with the neurologist who once again checked reflexes as well as hand and arm strength. He tested the hands in a few ways and said it all looks good. He examined the muscles too. But recommended an EMG. He thinks I might have compression of the ulnar nerve.

I have had random aches in the forearm, inter dorsal muscle (the one between thumb and index finger), as well as numbness while sleeping on the forth and fifth digits.

I can still button my shirt and hold glasses. I haven’t dropped any and can still drive, unscrew tight caps.

I am slightly concerned about the EMG though I know thats a standard tests for carpal tunnel and ulnar.

the EMG won’t be for 6 more weeks and I’m the meantime, I’d just like to make sure there isn’t anything on the ALSside for me to worry about.

given I have been twitching 9 months, and it’s been 6 months post first visit with the neurologist, would ALS have progressed up the arm, or would my hand have been just completely useless by now?

Did I damage my prostate?,"Background: Caucasian 22 y/o male, 5’8, 170lbs. Also this might be a bit gross so proceed with caution. 

I have experimented with anal masturbation in the past with no issues medically, mainly because I usually end up getting tired of cleaning up the fecal matter while I’m trying to get off. 

A few weeks ago I tried it again and got to a point where I wasn’t running into any poop, so I was able to have more fun and be a little more aggressive with it. I used some lube and also a miniature baseball bat. I did not achieve an anal orgasm but got to a point where there was a small amount of blood on my fingers. I stopped around that point. 

Fast forward to a few days ago(?) I don’t remember exactly when I started experiencing these symptoms but now at random points in the day I will notice a dull pain in my penis or occasionally one of the testicles. Also whenever I feel the need to urinate, it kind of hits all at once, where I don’t really notice anything and then all of a sudden I really need to go to the bathroom. 

I kind of assume since these symptoms are very close to this incident that maybe I caused my prostate to inflame or caused some other kind of damage in there. I don’t have any other symptoms I know of, and the pain is not unbearable at all, but definitely noticeable. Just wondering if I should be concerned or if this is maybe something that will go away as long as I give my ass a break.

ASD, Hirschsprungs as infant, 

Every time I have went to my primary care doctor, he seems only interested in referring out to specialist.

Sent me to gastroenterologist for follow up after 40 years for Hirschsprungs. Gastro was wondering why since not symptomatic. 

Sent referral to phys therapy when I mentioned my hip was hurting. I didn't go just followed the exercises from the printout he gave and they helped.

Next week I have my physical and was planning on telling him about a mole that feels like it is being sliced by a razor every now and then. And to tell him about an episode a month ago where my bladder suddenly let go while driving. 

My question is does he really want to know this stuff, or is he just going to refer to a dermatologist and urologist? I am frustrated with everything being a referral. Makes me question the point of having a primary at all."

"(23F) Applied DuoFilm on my skin tag, which irritated the skin surrounding it. Any advice?","[Here is a photo of the spots.](https://imgur.com/a/QehdBSA) 

The little black dot in the middle is the skin tag. It’s all dried up and should fall off soon but the skin surrounding it is irritated. I applied too much of the DuoFilm* and it got onto the surrounding skin.

It’s raised and itchy but not painful (at all) or hot to the touch. It’s also peeling. I’ve just been icing it when it gets too itchy. 

Like I said, the skin tag part should fall off soon but does anyone have any advice about the skin around it? I’m kinda worried it might scar, and it’s in a really noticeable spot (collarbone area). Should I be moisturising it or applying any special creams?

* taking spironolactone 
* diagnosed with migraines 
* location: right foot, heel 
* duration: happened @ the end of august

I stepped on something (glass, porcelain who knows) at the end of august. Hurt terribly for a few days. I went to urgent care and had an x ray. Nothing showed up. The problem went away after a week! 

I had a little white spot there for weeks. Recently, starting having discomfort again but not serious pain. After a shower a few days ago, i noticed the puncture wound was reopened and bleeding. Not a lot but it was red. Wasn’t sore. I cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol. 

Now today, it is feeling sore when i apply pressure to it, but I can walk and it’s not significant pain. I am worried though. It looks dark, like a red/black spot. 

If it reopened itself and bled when it hadn’t in a month, does that mean it worked itself out? Could this just be sore? What should I do?"

Urethral Stricture from penis getting pinched?,"-	31 yrs old
-	USA
-	Male
-	No medical conditions

Is it possible to give yourself a urethras stricture form accidentally pinching penis?

I was in the pool with a circular raft that had some type of “wire” built into the outside perimeter to help keep it in shape and floating. 

As I was getting off the raft (belly down to the ground) the raft wire starting floating up to the service while my body was sinking. 

The edge of the raft “wire” pinched my penis while it was floating up to the surface. It pinched my penis on the underside of it right below the head. It was pinched between my body and the raft. 

It definitely hurt for a few seconds until I removed the raft from punching me, and I’m wondering if it’s possible if I gave myself a urethral stricture?

I don’t have any blood when I urinate, but the tip of my penis area is a bit sensitive. 

Is it pretty difficult to give yourself a stricture by simply pinching my flaccid penis? Would I need to have other symptoms to know if I had a stricture?

Thanks in advance for the help."

Whew!  I hope no one invested too much time reading that!  I'm posting here because  I had a curious experience a few years ago with ""trigger thumbs,"" and I still wonder what caused it and whether it could be related to some of my other aches and pains.

So, one day in my late 30's, one of my thumbs started getting stuck in the ""ON"" position, and Dr. Google diagnosed it as a case of trigger finger.  Within a week or two, the other thumb followed suit.  I visited a rheumatologist, who did blood tests, which came back negative.  Both thumbs remained obstinate for a few months, then they just gave up and went back to normal, and it never happened again.  The end!

At the time, there was nothing new or different in my diet, my medications, my habits, my work, my hobbies, or anything else (I had not yet discovered Candy Crush).  It definitely wasn't a case of overuse or repetitive motion, unless repetitive napping counts.

Any ideas what could have caused this?  All my life, I've had various mild aches and tangles and prickles and zaps and pops and cricks and cramps and stiffness and stickiness in my joints and muscles, but the rheumatologist screened for a variety of diseases involving  inflammation and connective tissues (as did the ENT when my tracheal stenosis was first diagnosed), and all results were negative.

TIA! ... by which I mean ""thanks in advance,"" not ... well, you know.

Hi for this last week I've been having reoccurring left arm pain, the pain comes down into my left hand also and into my left ring finger, it's usually a throbbing pain but sometimes it's shooting pain, and when I lay down at night to sleep I feel a lot of pressure on my chest, it's feels heavy like I have trouble to breathe along with my left arm pain. I'm wondering if I should get this checked out at the hospital maybe? I've just been trying to ignore it because I have a bit of a cardiac history but I had a full workup last year (stress test, echo, and ECG) and my cardiologist told me I seem pretty fine !! But I have to admit I am a bit concerned, I considered it could just be stress or anxiety but when I take my ativan the symptoms still persist, they do not go away. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"

Severe tingling pain in sole of foot after broken tibia and fibula,"17M, 5'9, 165lb, White, Currently taking 600mg ibuprofen every 6hrs and asprin every 24hrs, and DO NOT use any alcohol or drugs.

Background: Broke my right tibia and fibula (clean break) playing soccer on Sept. 19th, had CRIF surgery on Sept. 20th, and left the hospital on Sept. 23rd. I was not having the pain described here until about Sept. 26/27th, about the time I stopped taking the 3 day supply of Percocet I was sent home with.

Primary Complaint: For about 8-9 days I've been having awful pain (best described as tingling or pins and needles) in the bottom of my foot, and most of my pain is localized in what online diagrams show as the Medial Plantar Nerve. This pain has prevented me from returning to school, sleeping normally, and from getting out of the house most of the time. It's pretty common for me to be visually shaking from the pain, and sometimes my body jolts from the pain. I've always found that I have a pretty high pain tolerance but this is awful. The only relief I've found is to constantly slap or rub another place on my body to distract from the pain. Also, icing it seems to help, but it has to be extremely cold to help, it could just be the numbness pain from the ice distracting me from my foot, I'm not sure. Moving my foot in any way seems to amplify the pain, and that includes repositioning, curling my toes (or at least trying to), etc. There is still some swelling in my ankle but nowhere close to what it looked like while in the hospital. Also, I took half a Percocet last night in attempt to help with the pain and it didn't help at all.

I know that nerve damage is common with this type of injury, but I don't think it should be this severe and last this long. Any advice or information would be much appreciated, feel free to ask any questions too. I have x-ray pictures of the break before surgery too if those would help. Thanks!"
Bladder going crazy? Who you gonna call? Wait.. there are no Bladder Busters? … Well maybe Ask Doc can help.,"\[50 F\] 5'6"" 247 lbs. Caucasian.  I do drink some.  I vape with nicotine.  I do not use any other drugs.  I am diagnosed as Bipolar type 1 with mixed mania.  I am not currently under treatment as I just got insurance.  The diagnosis is based on Social Security Findings. 

Primary Complaint.  I am having weird bladder problems.  Approximately  5 years ago I had surgery to fix stress incontinence.  Something about a prolapsed urethra.  There was some sort of mesh involved I think.  The first 3 ish years all was good.  I could step off a sidewalk, cough, sneeze, laugh without peeing.  All was good.  

Two or three years ago I noticed that I didn't get the signals for needing to do until I HAD to go.  But it was still ok.  I could make it.  As long as I didn't ignore it.  At this point in my life I still didn't have insurance.  So I just used Poise Pads and hoped for the best.  

In the last six months I have been having to go with more urgency and less warning.  Another thing that has been happening is if I have to go, the closer I get to a bathroom the more urgent.  I have been losing weight.  I can now pull all of my pants down without unzipping.  I can't buy smaller pants because I would never be able to get them off fast enough.

This all came to a head today.  I take a bus to work.  I got off the bus, crossed the parking lot and suddenly had to pee.  Ran to the bathroom, barely made it.  Came out of the bathroom, talked to someone, had to pee.  Again barely made it.  Came out of the bathroom,  started my job, was in the middle of a task, had to pee, peed my pants.  Left work, came home and had to pee.  All in 1.5 hours.  And always a lot of pee.  Not tinkle, actual like full bladder pee.

22F Lumps under armpits,"https://imgur.com/gallery/8CzCTyH

So this started back in June, I had several medium sized lumps under both armpits. They got worse in July, I took antibiotics, they went away. 
One day I shaved (with a  VERY old razor) immediately came back, the one in my right armpit was AS ANGRY AS CAN BE. Went back to the doctor because of how huge and painful it was, got diagnosed with folliculitis, took double the antibiotics as the first time. It drained a comical amount of pics and blood, everything was fine.
I shaved again (with new razors) 2 weeks later. It's been 2 weeks with no issue. I noticed a small but painful pimple in my right armpit a couple days ago.....today I noticed another lump.
What IS THIS. Back in March I got cleared for any type of autoimmune disease (was very lethargic and didn't know why) all of my tests were normal, nothing was weird."

The marks are on the right side of my left leg, between my knee and my knee-pit. It may be a bit hard to see so [here](https://i.imgur.com/tCvoUeR.jpg) is another image with the dots highlighted.

I noticed this for the first time on Thursday morning but I took the picture yesterday. Basically I woke up with a slightly raised reddish area on my leg, and in the middle were these marks. After a day or so the reddish raised area went away, but the marks did not. There were no signs of bats in my dorm after searching my drawers and luggage, and I'm pretty sure my window was closed while I was sleeping, but even if it wasn't, it has a screen on it with no holes so a bat couldn't have gotten in. I've been wearing long pants every day for the past few weeks (except on Thursday, but that was after I noticed the marks). 

The thing that worried me was that they were in an arc shape which I thought could possibly be suggestive of a bite mark. Frankly I have no real reason to believe this is a bite mark other than this (since there were no bats in my room and I haven't seen a bat since I got here) but also the possibly-dire consequences of rabies has sort of gotten me worried about whether or not this is worth worrying about. Am I overreacting? I believe I might have some kind of issue with medical anxiety (I have in the past also freaked out a bit about mad cow disease, cancer, more rabies, brain-eating amoeba, etc.) but there's also that saying ""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you""."
Does gallbladder removal irritate the intestinal tract?,"I've just had my gallbladder removed (laprascopically).

I've always had an interest in medicine, so have found learning about this fascinating — particularly watching the YouTube videos of the procedure.

I have one question of my own as well as something I've read on Facebook groups that I'm dubious about.

**My question:**

Without a gallbladder, bile from the liver flows directly (and continuously) into the small intestines, correct?

Does this fluid (bile) irritate the digestive tract?

Does the continuous flow of it cause any kind of erosive damage, much like the reflux of stomach contents does to the esophagus?

**""Cholecystectomy makes the liver work harder"". Is it a myth?**

I've also read on Facebook groups that not having a gallbladder ""makes the liver have to work harder."" I can't understand why this would be the case.

Is this a myth?

(To add: I understand that cholecystectomy is associated with a transient elevation of liver enzymes and that it has been associated with a raised incidence of liver disease, although I believe that the speculated method was the disruption of the intestinal flora).

Duration: 9 days

Current medication: Naproxen 500mg 2dd, since last Thursday

Medical Issue:  
I should start with saying I'm studying Dentistry, so I do have some medical background information.  
I suffer from a sore throat quite a bit. I think almost every month, i'm having a cold for almost a week with a sore throat and stuff. In May 2019, I suffered from a severe viral pharyngitis and got some NSAID's (Naproxen, 500mg) from my doctor. 9 days ago, my throat started hurting really bad, and I found it the almost the same as may 2019, so I started taking Naproxen to prevent it from worsening into a bad pharyngitis. 2 days later (Saturday last week) I had a party where I also smoked about 10 cigarettes (I know, not very good for my throat...). The next morning, I woke up and my throat hurt even more. I continued taking Naproxen, but since my stomach started hurting and I didn't had any PPIs, I stopped taking them. In the mean time I did not check my throat to have a look at the situation, but I felt that my tonsils where a bit swollen.  
Last Thursday, I had a look at my throat and it looked like this: [https://imgur.com/a/OaBBjby](https://imgur.com/a/OaBBjby)  
Since it looked red and swollen, I was thinking about an inflammation of my palatopharyngeal arch, so I started taking Naproxen again (without PPIs).   
Today, my palatopharyngeal arch looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/wcZpeoP](https://imgur.com/a/wcZpeoP)  
For me, it still looks the same and swallowing without fluid hurts quite bad.  


I am kind of worried that this isn't a viral inflammation, because Naproxen doesn't seem to help a lot. Might be worth a visit to the doctor to test if it's a bacterial infection?

(19M) Facial/Sinus pain but sinus CT is clear,"19M, UK, ~182cm, ~67kg

Primary Complaint: Facial pain, coughing up mucus, fatigue

Duration: 10+months

Medical Issues: No long term conditions known

Medications/doses: Fluticasone Furoate 27.5mg 1xday (often used more), previously have had Mometasone furoate 2xday. They don't seem to be of much help.

I went to see an ENT due to facial pain in sinus areas- cheeks, forehead and especially around the sides of my nose, to the point that I get the sensation of wanting to pull off my cheeks. This seems to be worse when my eyes are ""tired"" from computer screens or my glasses so I tend to wear contacts more. I have also been coughing up green mucus in the morning and evenings since about July.

I was surprised to see that the sinus CT showed nothing. 

I've tried everything I can to alleviate the issue- steroid sprays, sinus rinses, sterimar sprays, decongestant pills, circumin pills as an anti-inflammatory, warm face masks etc. but nothing seems to work.

One doctor who looked in my nose thought she found enlarged adenoid tissue in my nose and wanted to biospy it. The consultant checked later and disagreed. I thought adenoid hypertrophy would have made perfect sense given the frequency of otis media infections (7 in 2 years) that I had when I was 7/8.

I was prescribed another round and I’m on day two, but then another doc recommended Levofloxacin 500mg for 7 days. Should I finish the Z-Pak first or just start right away on the Levofloxacin? 

What do you think of this advice generally of trying Levofloxacin? I’m slow to try antibiotics and understand they don’t help viral problems, but based on my history, I’m confident this has become a bacterial infection. In the past it resolved quickly with z-pak. Thanks."
Is it okay to skip period week on first birth control packet?,"I (24F) have been on birth control for a while but I was off for about a month and a half to give my skin a break (it kept breaking out) so I got a new birth control prescribed and this is my first packet. I started it when I got my period and it is about to reach the period week. I am going on vacation though in a couple days and don't want my period!

Is it okay to skip it and just start a new pack? Or will I not even actually get my period since it is a new birth control and still getting adjusted. Thank you!!!"

Having diarrhea today (not the issue this is from eating a whole frozen pizza and ice cream) and at this point am just passing mucus/bile but also these worm looking things filled with what looks like blood. It has been in the last 3 bms I've had this morning and is very alarming and I'm curious to what it is. 

The pizza was the only thing I had to eat yesterday and only had coffee during the day, previous nights food was an egg, ground pork, and spicy noodles. Have not eaten this morning yet.

I'm having chest pains from coughing and breathing deep and I'm getting a bit worried and unsure if i should go to the ER. I've been sick with a lot of mucus, coughing, chest pain, and sore throat for about 2 weeks, but now it's only chest pain and a cough. Every time I take a deep breath, it really hurts and triggers a coughing fit and mucus. I'd just go to the doctor, but I'm in a new state ((and I'd rather not worry my family/friends)) without much transportation.   
More information on the beginning illness: It began with a sore throat only, progressed to muscle aches, coughing up yellow mucus, a lot of sneezing, and general fatigue, then mostly cleared up with the yellow mucus and sore throat, leaving behind this increasing chest pain and coughing."

Prior to the complaint, I had a normal sleep schedule. I would go to bed at the same time each night, sleep for 8-10 hours, and wake normally. Recently, however, I have found myself not being tired, and attempts to sleep result in me lying awake for extended periods of time. This period of sleeplessness will continue for a period of 3-4 days, until I end up suddenly extremely tired and only then will sleep for 8-10 hours, only to have the cycle begin anew when I wake up. Occasionally, the sedation from the Lurasidone will knock me out, but the sleep quality is extremely poor, lasts for 1-2 hours only, and I will wake again not feeling any better for it. There was no gradual onset of sleeplessness. One day I woke up normally, and then could not go to sleep the next night. There is no anxiety associated with my attempts to sleep. No racing thoughts or anything of that nature. I conduct my usual sleep hygiene habits (which have not changed significantly in the past 10 years or so). 

I don't seem to be suffering from the normal effects of lack of sleep. No impaired cognitive function, reflexes are normal, and I am not experiencing microsleep. My speech is normal, and I can plan and execute complex tasks successfully up until the point where the sudden bouts of sleepiness overtake me on the third or fourth day, and I begin to experience the normal side-effects of sleeplessness. 

I'm really not sure what to do at this point. This has never happened to me in the past. I've had insomnia on and off over the years, but was always able to overcome it and get some sleep every night. Should I be concerned about this?"
I’m getting sicker and no one is helping. Swallowing liquids feels like glass and I’m sweaty and weak.,"I’m a female 22years 5’7 130 pounds. Non smoker social drinker no drugs. USA

2 days ago I had body aches and a fever of 102 with 122 pulse rate. Urgent care sent me home. At the time I had no sore throat. I started to feel better and then last night my throat got sore and I felt extremely weak. I saw a nurse Practioner today as my fever has broken but I CAN BARELY SWALLOW. My throat feels bruised and cut up. Gatorade feels like acid and it HURTS. I can barely eat or drink because of the pain. The NP said he saw one tonsil stone. Which I’ve never had before. Didn’t even feel my lymph nodes or anything. Sent me to have a mono spot and CBC. Called me and said they both came back normal and it’s ALLERGIES. I HAD A FEVER AND BODY ACHES. Idiot.

I’m already taking Motrin and Tylenol around the clock. Nothing is helping the pain and I can’t eat at all and can barely drink, even water is excruciating going down. No one is offering me any relief and I’m crying because I’m so miserable and thirsty. Even swallowing my own spit hurts. Please someone help me."
"Wake up shaking and disoriented, but only after drinking only one or fewer drinks. What could cause this? [28F]","Hi, 

I’ve had this problem that has baffled me and my doctor isn’t sure what to make of it. It’s gotten to the point where I just don’t drink socially anymore and I 100% don’t have an alcohol problem. I’m a 28 year old white female, 5’6” ~220 lbs, medical conditions are Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, asthma, and borderline mild sleep apnea (no treatment). I take 250mg lamotrigine for bipolar 2, which is well managed, Flovent or albuterol for the asthma, and 50mcg levothyroxine for the Hashimoto’s. Don’t smoke, don’t do drugs (not even pot).  

Problem: whenever I drink now, even half a glass of wine at 6pm, I wake up incredibly shaky, lightheaded, and disoriented the next day, oftentimes accompanied by my stomach feeling empty almost to the point of nausea (this happens regardless of whether I ate regular meals the day before). It takes a while for me to “come to” even though I’m awake and after about 30 minutes I’m back to normal. This has been happening for a little over a year now. 

These aren’t the symptoms of being hungover that I experienced in the past, and I’m confused about one drink causing it because it’s very extreme (the first couple of times I thought I was dying). I’ve considered reactive hypoglycemia but I have no history of that and my bloodwork is always normal, including A1C. Also, it happens regardless of whether I drank 9 or 13 hours before I wake up so would that still fall under scope of reactive? I only get the symptoms when I wake up from a night’s sleep. 

One of my friends suggested sleep apnea but it only happens when I have even the slightest amount of alcohol so unsure of the correlation there. Medication interaction? Something else?

Any new ideas or input would be super helpful for me to bring up so I can rule them out with my doctor. Thanks!"
"Sudden hearing loss in one ear, is this worrying on its own?","Hi!

I checked for older posts with basically the same title and there were a few but I'm not sure the answers were applicable to me since I have none of the other issues those people had.

(Me being 25 years old, female, no medical issues apart from slight anemia - took iron supplements for this for months, now on a break from those but eating food rich in iron -, taking antidepressants but no other medication, slightly abnormal ECG due to the antidepressants but no other known heart issues and this is a common side symptom.)

Starting a few months ago, I felt like the hearing in my right ear got worse periodically. Some days I just couldn't properly hear, it got annoying. I went to a hearing aid shop and got a free hearing test done which came out normal-ish. Some frequencies slightly below normal but that could probably be solved by having an ENT doctor clean the ear out. So I decided I'd imagined it.

Now three days ago I just stopped being able to hear. Feels like the ear is blocked and it should re-open if I swallow or move my head the right way but three days later it still hasn't happened. And I just really can hardly hear anything. I tested it with headphones and to be able to hear anything in my right ear at all (not even enough to understand anything), I'd have to turn the volume up to a level which was uncomfortably loud for my left ear. Driving yesterday was strange, too.

I've felt a little bit dizzy sometimes in the last three days but not to the degree where I couldn't walk or stand straight. I also slept a lot (12+ hours per night when I usually sleep 7 - 9) which I decided was the reason for the dizziness. 

Not sure whether I should treat this as something to worry about or just wait until it goes away. My first instinct tends to be to ignore any symptoms but the replies to the old posts scared me a bit. 

Maybe some water got into my ear when I was washing my hair and it's no big deal at all?!"
Staph infection or just eczema?,"23F, 5'2"", UK, eczema (but no flare ups for past 2 yrs)

Over summer I developed some sort of skin problem covering the whole of my forehead- swollen, red, hot. About a month ago I noticed yellow crusting when I wake up in some patches on my forehead and the redness seemed to get worse. This then spread to under my eyes and I noticed yellow crusting here too. I also have a couple of patches on my chin that have been there for a few months and let out a clear yellow discharge from time to time. 

I saw my Dr and was prescribed Flucloxicillin and diagnosed with infected eczema. This calmed it down, much less red and almost completely cleared under my eyes but around day 4 of tx it got worse again. I was then prescribed Co-amoxiclav 7 days and this cleared it up a lot- no longer red/hot and only a tiny patch left under my eyes. However, a couple of days after the course finished it came back, and is getting redder and hot. I also notice yellow crusting most days waking up. I'm worried that I am still infected as both rounds of abx made it go down, but my Dr is diagnosing it as just eczema/ no infection now. Any thoughts as I'm quite worried and it seems to be spreading?"

She was sleeping when the Hospitalist rounded this morning 10/5/19 and did not get to ask about eating. Now the nurses are telling her that she has to have a BM before she can progress to a clear liquid diet. How can she have a BM with nothing to eat in eight days and being s/p hemicolectomy.

Writer's cramp? Treatments used mentioned below.,"I am studying again for an exam. But it has a lot to write. Also was a software developer for a company. 30M.

I am suffering with writer's cramp for more than 15 years as far as I know ( I was a high school guy)

History (start)
I went through physiotherapy, quackery ( Indian small town parents easily fall into it), massages and then finally landed to psychiatry, 12 years ago. There I was given trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane) for 2.5 months and wasn't told that it could have withdrawals. ( Yes docs , it had when I left it - but was denied).

Then Pacitane changed everything, from normal person with writing difficulty , i was labeled with mental illness. ( Pacitane withdrawal - again forcing- its true, it can cause withdrawal)

All through , I went through psychiatric drugs , then stopped - graduated , had job which needed less writing.

(close)

Now I want to prepare for another exam which needs a lot of writing but I am still unable to write.
I have to very very consciously work on making alphabets and numbers which effect my thoughts on paper. 

Is there anything in the world that can help?"
Need help with nausea (14M) [not urgent],"Sometimes, when I wake up I feel nauseous, sometimes it happens on days when I have to do something that makes me nervous (travel or summer school)

It can also happen on normal days ( usually if I don't get good sleep) but it normally goes away after a couple of hours.

I have pills for transport sickness which help but don't make the sensation(of having to throw up) go away

I don't eat meat, I think I eat pretty healthy tho.

I usually go to sleep a 10 or 11 and wake up at 7.

This really sucks, half the great things I've done the past years I've done after or before throwing up.
Is this just a result of bad sleep or are there other possible causes?
What can I do to make it not happen or make it better when I happens?

Sudden kanker sores continuously developing,"Hello everyone,
24 years old 
Male
121 lbs 
5ft 4in 

I am not taking any medication.

About 2 weeks ago I developed a kanker sores near my gum but still on the lower inner lip.. very close to the gums. 

That slowly went away after a week, but then another one developed in the upper inner lip area about the time that the lower one was gone ... Odd.  I've had canker sores but not commonly. Certainly not back to back.

To make matters worse after the upper lip one recovered, 3 more developed around the mouth.

So that's now the present. I went and bought Colgate's peroxyl mouth wash and kanka to deal with it for now... But according to the instructions/labels I should not use them for over a week and should contact a doctor if the problems persist after that time. 

I do plan on going but was wondering if this is better to go to the dentist instead?

Its worth noting I haven't had any drastic changes in my diet, and I drink a good amount of water every day. I stand for the majority of the day at work at a standing desk. I have not had time to exercise like I used to and I do believe they started happening fairly soon after I stopped working out regularly, bit idk if that's a coincidence. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
Chest pressure,I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma several months ago with enlarged nodes in my neck and chest. After 4 rounds of treatment I had a repeat PET scan and the nodes in my neck were gone completely and the nodes in my chest had gone down to 6.4 cm from 10cm. That was 2 rounds ago and for the past several days I have been experiencing a pressure in my chest/lung area. Coukd this be my lungs just expanding moreso than they've been able to in a long time? That makes sense in my head. Since there's no reason to believe that my cancer would all of the sudden do a 180 and start getting worse.

6 days ago I woke up to a slight, very manageable, pain near the base of my penis shaft which felt like an ingrown hair. I thought it was an ingrown hair and ignored it. Had sex, went to pee, felt very intense pain on my shaft, looked at my peehole and there were several drops of blood.   

After that episode, most of my urination were fine, but a few had pain similar to UTI pain. I haven't peed blood since then. I had another manageable, but slightly painful, piss this morning.

How soon after vomiting can I return to a normal diet?,"Unfortunately I (21M) am a massive glutton and took it too far this time.

Can a girl still be pregnant if she had a period two weeks after sex?,"Long story short, a good friend of mine is in a bit of a bind. He and his fiance aren't doing that well, and their sexual relationship is faltering as he's confided in me many times. He noted they had sex about a month ago, and two weeks later she had her period for 4-5 days. After that they didn't have sex again (or any form of intercourse he notes) and now, after 40 days, her period still hasn't come and it was revealed that she was preganant. She told him that was possible, but he isn't sure. We had a few beers yesterday evening and he basically had a breakdown. He wants to believe her. But doesn't.

I know both of them fairly well, and I cannot imagine she'd cheat on him. But I also admit to not knowing a lot about the female anatomy or how periods really work. 

So yeah basically, the timetable: sex > 2 weeks nothing > period > 40 days nothing >preganant. Is that...even possible? Like a delayed pregnancy? I want to give him some insight where possible. Sorry if this question doesn't go here. If so, can someone redirect me to a place where I can post it? They both don't use reddit iirc, so I just use my main account for this. Thanks!"
Steroids effects on allergic reactions?,"24 year old female. 180lbs, 5’5. Medical conditions: IBS-D. Current medications: multivitamin, Wellbutrin 300mg per day, birth control pill. Current complaint, food allergies. 

In May 2019 I was diagnosed with IBS-D which has been controlled to an extent using Wellbutrin. Some days, I want to die. 

The two weeks has been pretty bad which prompted me to contact my doctor with all of the symptoms I was having. Constantly tired, headaches, brain fog, diarrhea, upset stomach. I’ve identified I can’t have dairy in any aspect I will have severe diarrhea for a couple days. My doctor advised for me to stop eating gluten as well. Celiac disease runs in my family.  I also set up food allergy tests for the 22nd. 

When this all really ramped up, I consumed a whole lot of gluten, bread and pasta. 

Yesterday morning was the last time I consumed gluten. I have not had any since then. Today, I woke up with an itchy rash on my right cheek - the left side of my face and nose aren’t affected with itchy bumps. I used MDLIVE and was on a video chat with a family doc who immediately said that’s an allergic reaction. I began to tell him I’m in the midst of food allergy testing and the first thing he said is, stop eating gluten. I see this a lot. I was prescribed a medrol 4mg pack. 

I was advised to keep a food log until I’m tested for everything. I sent a message to my PCP with this update. 

He said I should really begin to feel better with these steroids and diet changes. 

A few questions: 
1. How long does it take for steroids to combat a rash? This isn’t pretty. 
2. Will the steroids help my whole body feel better since it suppresses the immune system?"

In the past week I have had a cracking joint pain in my elbows and knees that has no obvious cause to me. I am not bending my arms or legs in unnatural ways and they are cracking while doing things that hadn’t caused the cracking before in the past and hurt mildly. I have also developed tailbone pain that prevents me from bending over or sitting straight up. If I bend straight down I will get a piercing pain in my tailbone and I can’t bend over anymore. If I try to sit up straight from lying down I get the same piercing pain and have to roll to my side and try to sit up that way. I have not fallen/hit my tailbone in any hard way and it does not feel any different than it used to be. I’m not sure if this is important but I do have scoliosis and I’m not sure if that has anything to do with the tailbone pain. TIA"

[20M] Can someone please explain what exactly does it mean to get ‘help’? Like what could the process involve because I need to at least have an idea please because the idea of getting help is so anxiety inducing.,"I’m sitting here with a joint and a few beers in my hand right now. Probably will be taking some acid tonight that’s gonna throw me into the most horrific state of mind alongside some more weed and alcohol. Tired of what I’m doing to myself. Severe severe anxiety, depression and an inability to stay sober for a second. Anxiety is stopping me from functioning or makes me do things with the feeling such a weight on my shoulders and the sensation of my heart dropping very frequently. No preferred substance, just *a* substance to take me away from sobriety. Although saying that, it’s usually weed + one other drug (like weed + speed or weed + alcohol, weed + MDMA etc. I get too bored so cycle through stuff. Suicidal thoughts on a daily. Only once did I almost go through with it. But recently (well for the past 12 months +), it’s more like just thinking of throwing myself onto the train tracks or to jump into the river Thames every time I go on a bridge every time (but nothing major like I only just put my arm on the railings and just thinking of the moment. I’m extremely scared of heights so I’d never do it and I always have to look away from the water when I put my hand on the bridge). 


Like I’m failing uni at an engineering course at a uni that’s a guarantee for a good job.

I’m just gonna continue staying high until that point I’m sorry. The process of getting help seems unbelievably anxiety inducing so I need to at least have an idea please. I want to change and be a normally functioning human being desperately. Just graduating with a 2:1 will allow me to provide for my family. I need this and I won’t get any further student finance from the government since I’m currently using my max one year retakes worth of extra funding (unless I apply for CPR, compelling personal reasons but I don’t think I’m eligible since this is all my fault). Like I’ve taken LD50 amounts of stuff like MDMA but not in one sitting. More like over a single day or so and not a single dose which might be why I’m still here. I really need this and I think I can do it I don’t know. For my younger brother and baby sister too at least. I’m based in the UK too if it’s relevant. Thank you so much for the help.

 Stretch marks appeared all over my lower body and in my underarm area, deep and white. Not like when I first had them. I mean when I entered puberty I got the ones on my hips like red pencil marks and they just faded to nothinh and didn't feel different texture to the surrounding skin.

I went to my gp atleast 5 times in  2 years regarding this problem and all she said was that it was becouse massive rapid weight gain and weight loss and normal aging wich was ridiculous to me since I weighed 53 kg since 16 and she knew that seeing me 2 times a year for the ten years prior, also normal aging can't be right I never saw anyone like me in my family and all the women get older then 90. At that time it was a very long waitinglist for changing practices and where I'm from you absolutly need a referal  and I just couldn't  think  for what specialist to ask for  I just gave up .


I'm hoping someone has seen something like this before and can explain me a little. Sorry for the long and probably unclear story. If you came this far, thank you for reading."
Bumps & Lumps & Anxiety,"Hello,

This post is about lumps I’ve noticed on my body. A year ago I went to an ENT to check out a bump I noticed on the back right side of my neck. I got it surgically removed and it was benign. Now about three weeks ago I noticed an almost pimple like bump/lump in the middle of my left armpit. I went to the doctor to have him check it out and he said it is most likely a cyst. It was painful at first and now it has relaxed more and calmed down but it is still tender to the touch. Now the exact same thing has happened on my right armpit. This one I noticed about 4 days ago and since it is new it is more sensitive and painful than the one on my left armpit. Both seem to be mobile, the new one seems more firm than the old one. 

Around the time I noticed the new armpit bump, I now have one on my upper right thigh next to my groin. This one is also tender and sensitive when I touch it or anything. These are really fucking annoying and really weighing on my anxiety. 

I’m 23 years old, male, quit drinking 54 days ago, quitting vaping today, and I’m 6’2” and about 180lbs.

I just can help to think I have cancer or something and it’s so annoying. I want them removed but my parents are sick of hearing about my lumps since I’ve been to the doctor and he doesn’t seem too worried about it. He doesn’t know about the two new lumps, just the left armpit one. I feel healthy otherwise, maybe a bit lethargic but idk. I really would like some input/advice. I felt kind of sick 3 days ago but feel much better now.

I thought that lymph nodes were on the outer side of armpits and not directly in the middle of the armpit. 

Could this be anything related to vaping juul pods? Stretch I know but I’m quitting that today, and really just want some closure on this so badly.

Thank you"
IBS or something else?,"Hi medical people!

Strange rash,"23f, 5ft3 or 4?, 70 kg, English, rashes bilaterally below the knees (legs and feet), noticed after work one evening, didn't seem to spread. Itchy. Nothing changed in my day-day/ eating habits. Discussed with doctor at work who suggested it wasn't an allergic reaction else it would be more wide spread, he described the rash as ""purpura"" and suggested it could be ITP if it spreads. Dr advised to take 4mg piriton which I don't feel did much. Maybe it helped reduce redness or itching? Unsure (I was also very busy at work) 

Rash was noticed at 6pm Monday, its looked more aggressive by Tuesday morning but gradually started to fade although it is still present 4 days later. 

I have been having headaches for the past week but I believe that is stress/dehydration.

Headache when heart rate increases,"(13yo female) so first of all. I think its relevant to say that I do have fibromyalgia and cfs, so it may be related to that. But I have found when my heart rate goes up (after panic attacks or excercise) that I get a terrible headache. It's sort of a throbbing pain in the centre of my head, it stays for a day or so and I normally feel nauseous the next day. Pain killers dont work and I'm not really sure what to do. Advice would be appreciated, thank you :)"
Joint pain especially during stretching.,"I'm

I occasionally smoke weed and I don't drink. 


I've also been doing no physical exercise for a while now and not in a good shape (skinny fat) 


And I've noticed joint pain in my elbow and knees recently. Especially if I stretch my knees or elbow. Sometimes I feel it while walking or still. 


I especially started to notice it when once I was high and walking I suddenly felt as if my knee had slightly bent the wrong way. I had pain in that knee for a few days after that and felt like it'd happen again if I stretched too far.


My mother has arthritis and I hope this isn't a sign of that. I don't feel any such pain or anything anywhere else. I have been a very athletic person all my life but in the last 2 and a half years I've basically given up on it just in case that's relevant."
Antibiotics Stopped Joint Pain and Cognitive Issues?,"Hello - wanted input from any interested docs on here. For the last few months (about 6) I had increasing fatigue, cognitive changes, and painful joints. I assumed it was stress. Recently my doc felt a lump in my neck so we went down that road. While waiting for results, I got the grossest looking infection in my tonsils. (Needless to say, the lymph nodes were preparing for this battle, which is why I guess they were big).

Go to urgent care thinking it's strep. It's not, so then they test for mono, also negative. I also had symptoms of a UTI and my bowels weren't working correctly.

Enter levofloxican (sp), which they gave me as a precaution because after 3 hours they were stumped on what was wrong with me. EKG also came back abnormal, but my normal doc, who they called, told them to let me go home with 750mg dose of levo for 7 days. (She knows I hate hospitals)

I had been suffering for months and kept thinking it was stress. Especially when I started - overnight - showing symptoms of OCD and ADHD to the point it affected my job. Never have had an issue with my job and getting distracted.

I take this antibiotic, and the next day, for the first time in months, no joint pain, no overwhelming fatigue, and a clear head. Yes, no more fog. I did have a small scary incident after feeling like a million bucks where my vision completely went blurry out of nowhere. Got checked out, seems I experienced my first ever migraine aura.

Anyway - what kind of infection would cause this and would progressively get worse over about 6 months? The only thing that changed for me was they moved our office to a brand new building in November of last year. Other people are complaining of constantly feeling ill, but what kind of infection would do what it did to me?

Definitely interested to hear the responses.

2 years on/off numbness and weakness,"I'm female, 23yo, 5'1 and 105lbs. I drink socially (maybe once a week or less), and I don't smoke or do any drugs. I have narcolepsy without cataplexy, hypo/hyperthyroidism (post radioactive tablet), plantar fasciitis, and arthritis in my spine. For the past two years I've been dealing with numbness and weakness in my legs. Sometimes I can't walk at all (not because it hurts, because it doesn't) and sometimes I can kind of walk. I've seen an orthopedic, two neurologists, a physiatrist, my endocrinologist, and my pulmonologist. Nobody can figure it out. Half the time I get headaches when my legs stop working and the only fairly consistent trigger is when I'm going up hill or upstairs. My feet go cold and the numbness starts in my feet and works up to below my knees. Sometimes it goes into my thighs but not always. For the past 4 months I've had a spot on the top of my left foot that's been numb constantly. It doesn't hurt but if I press on it or lightly touch it it does become uncomfortable. Any ideas? I've already had two spinal taps, two nerve conduction studies, MRIs, and insane bloodwork."
I need medical advice to help Mom urinate independently,"Mom is paralyzed from the waist down. She can’t control or feel anything; including urination.

I also (35M) give her showers all the time, dye her hair, etc. Now that my sisters are getting married and living far from the house, my mom is always anxious and is worried about who is gonna take care of her. She feels dependent on us. I feel she doesn’t have to be. I feel there is some technology (other than urine bags or diapers) that can help her urinate independently and in privacy. I live in a retarded place on Earth, but I can buy stuff online. All I need are suggestions of “things” I can buy for my mom to help take care of her needs and become independent and happy again."

Returned home Thursday and went to workout this morning for an hour, that went fine. Later I went to Costco and as I was walking around, my vision went haywire. It was like my eyes were clicking like a camera shutter, I would look at something and then the image would briefly freeze and the more I looked at, the faster the “clicks” happened. I had to get out of the store because I was starting to freak out. I now have a bit of a pressure headache, which is rare for me.

[22M] Swelling and pain in the right side of my belly button and light pain in lower back. (update)," Age: 22 , Sex: M , Height: 6'0 , Weight: 160lbs , Race: Asian  No past record of anything related to abdominal area,got a medical record before for being dehydrated, I went to doctor(internist) last month and still in doubt about it.  (I posted before but this time with doctor's opinion)

I went to a doctor(internist) and told him that I'm having a sharp pain beside my belly button and pain in the back, and small lump beside of it. He told me it might be a hernia so he sent me to go for ultrasound to check the abdominal wall and kidney, all results are normal. So I went back to him told the result and been told to try to a surgeon to get a second opinion for it. I went to a surgeon but this time the lump is not visible anymore but the pain is still there. Even though the lump is not visible anymore, he touched it and felt nothing. He told me to go for another ultrasound(different hospital) but this time its focuses the belly button area, same result it's normal. Few days later the pain is gone but last few days(a month later) the pain is coming back and it feels like something is inside of it. The pain is not worse than the last time, it come and go but still, it's annoying especially when I'm going to sleep.

I was playing at my football club and then around a year ago my fitness drastically decreased. Keeping in mind that I was playing with a league of people 2 years older than me so my main attribute was fitness. After some tests i found out that i had an iron and vitamin D deficiency. Fast forward 2 months ago both these deficiencies were better than good. I still have bad fitness, shortage of breath, sweating more than usual, and feeling my heart thumping through my chest. We went to a heart doctors and did every scan there is to make and they said that my heart is perfectly fine but might have a slight allergy. We now moved to a lung doctor and he wants to give me something like an inhaler that has cortisone. Could these problems be linked to me masturbating? If so or if not, what can I do?"

I think I have bartter syndrome,"First I asked Dr Google and now I am asking you  


I am a 25 year old male weighing in at 60 Kg. I am 180cm tall and I take no medications and do not smoke. Anyway I keep getting these strange crystals in my urine and I feel horrible unless I eat massive amounts of oatmeal(I think its the phosphorus in it that I need). I urine alot and I am allways thirsty. The urine is very itchy/burning and I often have hypokalemia and my serum sodium is allways slightly elevated and I got this on recorded blood tests both present and years back.  


Taking a single antacid pill slows my breathing within an hour. It makes it progressively harder and harder to breathe untill I fall asleep. My breath just feel heavier and heavier and If I force breathe I pass out. I think that might be alkalosis from antacids and that shouldn't be possible from a single pill without having a kidney disease. 

So im guessing it is bartter syndrome but I would very like to hear an professional opinion about this."

Why can't electronic medical devices accurately read my blood pressure and pulse? 35F,"Not a serious medical issue, more of a phenomenon no one's been able to explain to me.

So my whole life, I've never had automatic blood pressure cuffs work on me. They inflate, stop, inflate more (at this point i'm experiencing pain), stop, inflates even more until I'm wincing and crying out in pain, and then either gives an error message or gives an inaccurate reading. I have Von Willebrand's Disease and this leaves a large bruise around my arm. I now automatically tell them to take my blood pressure manually.

My blood pressure is always in a healthy range when taken manually.

The fingertip devices that take pulse readings also don't work on me. They measure my pulse as being something insane and I always have to have it re-taken manually.

Are the automatic cuffs failing because they can't detect my pulse properly?

Likewise, even when having my blood pressure taken manually I've repeatedly had comments of ""you have a soft pulse"" and have had older nurses say they didn't have good enough of hearing to do it after trying and getting a younger nurse to take my blood pressure.

I've really never gotten much of an explanation for what this is, just that some people have ""soft"" pulses.

I had an EKG as a part of my pre-employment physical 10 years ago. There's nothing abnormal about my heart anyways, at least not then.

So part 1 of my question:
How do the electronic devices detect a pulse? Is it by sound, vibration, or what? And do automated blood pressure cuffs need to be able to detect my pulse to function properly?

Part 2 of my question:
Why is my pulse so quiet? Does it mean anything at all or is it just a unique characteristic of my body?"

Botched foot surgery,"I am a healthy athletic 51 year old female who has endured a year of hell due to a botched foot surgery 11 months ago in Glendale, California.  The main surgeon did not show up for my routine bunion and hammertoe surgery.  The podiatrist who did it said he ran out of time and I had a very complicated foot.

I am worse off than prior to surgery.  I can barely walk , swollen, horrible pain, stiffness, arthritic, nerve issues, bunion still there, and big toe goes under the hammertoe that is fat and sticks up. 

I have recently spoken to a few lawyers to see if I have any recourse and they all say you may have something but not big enough for us.

The last lawyer I spoke with was the only one who asked for money up front to have records reviewed by a podiatrist. Anywhere from 1,500-7,500 depending on how big my file is.  I'm sure I'll be on the lower end.

Is this wise? Is it a scam?

Prolactin Finger Stick Test Hight then Normal Venous - Test Results Inside - Advice?,"Hi, first post and would be grateful for any advice.I did 3 medichecks finger prick tests. Note, these are 10 tests in one male hormone package. The prolactin results from these are:

* Prolactin 349 mU/L (Range: 86 - 324) - 6-sept
* Prolactin 410 mU/L (Range: 86 - 324) - 25-sept
* Prolactin 565 mU/L (86 - 324) - 3-Oct

Each of the above tests were take at 7am in a fasted state with good food the night before and no alcohol or other fun activity.

I had a prolactin Venous test with the NHS with the following result:

* Serum prolactin level 135 mIU/L (73 - 407) 4-Oct

Note the dates of the last medichecks and the NHS one are only 1 day apart. I think the NHS was taken around 8.20am.

For the NHS test i did have some drinks with friends and a restaurant meal (not good quality) the evening before and additionally had a fast food breakfast on the day. My note from the GP didn't say ""fasted"" so it didn't cross my mind. That's the only difference I can think of.

Is it possible that the food etc caused an issue with the test or that medichecks are not accurate?

Many thanks."

22m 130lb 175cm nonsmoker - Laundry detergent in my ears,"About 3 months ago, I poured laundry detergent fully down both of my ears. I let it really get in there. Probably about 3-4 ounces at least, in each ear. It was very stupid obviously, and intended an act of self harm. Now I'm really worried. At first my ears felt quite clogged, but since then I haven't had pain or noticed any changes in my hearing. Where would the detergent go? Could it pass through somehow, or is it trapped in my ears forever? 😥

Edit: I told my doctor about it recently and she has done the quick routine ear check up with the scope. She has not sent me to the ENT. I thought I'd mention this because she didn't notice anything unusual."
Wiping issues,"20 year old male. 5’6, 120lbs. 
I do not smoke.

To preface this, I have pancreatic insufficiency but am currently on creon. 

When I shit, it’s always incredibly messy. It takes me so much time in a wiping session that my toilet usually overflows a few times a month. This much wiping causes bleeding every time. I think it’s anal fissures but could he hemorrhoids. Anyway, the pain from the bleeding is ridiculous, and working with it sucks. I also will end up coming back half an hour later to wipe and sure enough there’s more shit. 

I use tucks cream, wipes, etc—no avail.

I want to invest in a bidet, but naturally I can’t take that with me everywhere I go. 

Any ideas"
I [30M] cannot stop peeing after surgery!,"I had a fairly minor one hour surgery to remove some screws and a plate from a distal fibula fracture from 2 years ago.   Pain is pretty rough right now, so I’m trying to stay out and keep it elevated, but I am getting up to pee every 60-90 minutes, and all are very clear with a tinge of yellow, and it’s a lot every time.  I have had surgeries before but don’t recall ever experiencing this before.

Is this normal?  How long can I expect this to last?  Thank you for the help in advance!"
Need immediate advice on my friends situation.,"Age- 24 year old,height-5 feet 7 inches and 62kgs weight.

So meanwhile I'm forcing him to go to the doctor. I would need any advice I could get from you people.

He has always had dust allergy and he keeps having this allergy symptoms every other week which has recently increased. Also, few months back, he had symptoms like mucus and blood in stools so the doctor diagnosed him with lactose intolerance. After that he has been alright and these symptoms haven't appeared again. He still does get that allergic reaction every now and then. Also every time he goes to the doctor he has low BP and few days back it was 80/50 so the doctor had given him some tests for 8 am cortisol and one more thing which I couldn't read. He is yet to go to the doctor to get the tests done.

Also,few months back one day he suddenly had vomiting and was feeling very weak. So the doctor said he had low BP.

Today again the same thing happened and he was feeling dizzy along with nauseous,weakness and the same cough and allergy which he says is because of dust.

I have no idea what is going on but would like to get any opinions on what the condition might be.

No drugs or smoking 

Okay hopefully I included all the requirements. For about a month now, I’ve had a lot of body odor in JUST my right arm pit. Of course I wear deodorant everyday. I did switch deodorants but that was AFTER I had started getting the B/O. 

Used to, I could work an entire work day without deodorant and never smell. My boyfriend has smelled me before and claimed he never smelled anything. Now, he notices my B/O. 

Nothing has changed with products I use. Nothing has changed in my daily activities to increase sweating or anything. I feel like it (B/O) has truly sprung out of nowhere.

Is there a reason why this would happen or what I could do? Should I start exfoliating my pits? Should I try anything different? Anything helps. Thanks."

My brother has been shaking his head up and down and blinking rapidly for some time now; it happens at the same time and occurs around once every two hours. He doesn't seem to notice it and isn't bothered by it. I was thinking that it might be a tic or maybe even tremors. He also has this problem where he grunts at random times (a ""hm"" sound), sometimes in a high pitch as if he is trying to clear his throat; even if he isn't sick and his throat is already clear. I want to take him to the doctor just to be safe but my parents aren't convinced that it's something serious. Am I worrying too much or is it something serious that we should get checked out?"

I've had this symptom for years, I guess, but I kind of ignored it and then I didn't have my period for a long time due to PCOS. I've had two natural cycles in a row and it's happened again.

When I pass stool and wipe during my period, there's blood on the TP. It takes like two or three wipes to get a non-bloody piece of paper. It also happens when I am wearing a clean fresh tampon, and when I check my vagina for blood there's nothing. When I wipe the front there's no blood. (As in, I wipe the front first, no blood. Then the back, blood.) This only occurs after passing stool, not when I pee.

I normally don't have to push or strain on the toilet, and I don't have hemorrhoids.

Possible chemical burn in armpits from depilatory powder? What should I do?,"Hey there 22 y/o male around 270 lbs. 

Pics of burn at very end 

I think I have chemical burns in my armpits/underarms 


[Purchased this depilatory powder](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0048ZIFA0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
shaving powder and used it on my inner thigh last night (about 1 inch). 24 hours later no issues. Used it then today on my pubic area, testicals and legs. Left it on for about 8 minutes. Cleaned it off an had no issues. Then right after that I put it on my armpits and within about 2 minutes it started to burn. The label said to remove it if it started to burn so I rubbed it off with a towel and cold water. (No hair came out). 

The burn hurt for a bit and I put ""Veet gentle finishing cream"" on it and the pain subsided and I put some Vaseline on it. Been about 5 hours since then and the pain has been coming and going but has been here for a while now. I put some more Vaseline on it about 30 mins ago (which may be why the pictures look a bit oily?). 

My walk in clinic opens in about 4 hours so planning to go there anyway. 

The burn is not unbearable, I'm not in pain I can handle but it is still painful. Not sure how to describe it. I'm not withering in pain but I am also having trouble finding a comfortable position to sleep in (it's almost 6 am... granted I didn't try to go to bed til 4am). 

Everywhere else I used the powder is fine. My testicles are a bit sensitive but no where near as bad as my armpits are. 

I'm going to go to the doctor anyway but just wondering what I should be prepared for for peace of mind and if I should do anything differently (take off the Vaseline for example). Is this rash/burn going to get worse over the next few hours or is it as bad as it's going to be? Will my doctor give me anything that will make the pain go away immediately or am I going to be stuck like this for a few days...

Thanks

Testicular Height Switch,"Age: 18  
Sex: M  
Height: 6'2  
Weight: 286 lbs  
About a year ago, I was in college when I accidentally collided with someone else. Their backpack hit my groin. The collision was quite soft, but weirdly painful. My testicles hurt a little for about an hour or so and the pain subsided. I did notice however that my testicular height had changed. Before that my left testicle was lower than my right testicle, now it's the other way. My right testicle is lower and my left is higher. I have not experienced pain whatsoever nor can I see any varicocele or lumps. I should also add that my BMI is 34 and I have a lot of fat around the pubic area.

I asked my embryology teacher about this a year ago and he said that I had nothing to worry about since the pain had subsided and there were no lumps. What do you guys think?"
Curious,"Hello, I’m a 25 year old female. Height: 5feet and 2.5inches. Weight: 150 pounds.

I had an ENT specialist look in my throat and he told me that everything looked normal and he didn’t see anything life threatening, but I’m still having throat issues and being able to see what I believe is my Epiglottitis is kind of freaking me out.

So me being a dumb, depressed, basically suicidal teenager I would take hits from friends vape I've only done it maybe 4-5 times at different times like maybe a hit or two in March then maybe another hit in October but it's been years since I used a vape pen.

Now with the news of people getting sick and dying from vaping has made me very worried about getting sick from it and getting that lung disease those people ended up getting. I'm not a smoker the vape pen is the only thing I've ever used other than weed and last time I smoked weed was in February I don't drink and I've just got back into exercising since I couldn't for a little bit since I had pneumonia and I'm eating better now.

Supplements: folic acid, spearmint, Berberine, cucurmin/turmeric, multivitamin, probiotic

I noticed a small patch of slightly darker, slightly scaly skin on my mid back a few months ago. I have tendencies to have dry skin, so I didn’t think much of it. However, now, the original patch is much larger and is getting a couple smaller patches very near to it. They all look the same color and roughness. 

The rash appeared before I started taking methotrexate and prednisone, so I don’t think it’s caused by a new med. (These are the newest.) 

My rheumatologist didn’t want to look at it and said I need to go to a dermatologist to have it biopsied. 

Before I go, I want to have an idea of what I may be dealing with, especially if it may be autoimmune.

I've recently traveled and now the site of insertion is showing a bit of swelling and I'm getting growing itchy bumps around it. Could it possibly be an allergic reaction or infection? And is that even possible so long into having the implant inserted in the first place?

Swollen lymph nodes in several areas,"\- 24, Male. 6'2 (188cm), 170 lbs (78kgs), caucasian.

\- Complaint: Swollen (enlarged and tender) lymph nodes in neck, left armpit/side of breast, and possibly in the groin.

\- Not on any medications or drugs, and no medical conditions known to me apart from a slightly elevated metabolism. No history of lymphoma in the family, as far as I know.

\- Bakground:

* Over the last couple of months, I've been sick two times (I know how that sounds, please don't stop reading just yet). First I had a nasty cold, but did not notice any swollen nodes other than in my neck, which is normal for me. However, shortly after I'd recovered, I noticed some swelling and tenderness in my axillary nodes in my left armpit/side of breast. The nodes in my neck were reducing their swelling at this point. Two weeks later the glands in my armpit returned to normal, but I made the trip to my physician anyway and did some blood tests and checked for infections. Nothing out of the ordinary (bear with me).
* **Fast forward two months**, and I get an awful throat infection (viral). It hurt like hell, and as per usual I had swollen nodes in my neck. **However,** yet again I noticed swelling of the nodes in my armpit, and I think I feel some tenderness in my groin as well. **And this began during the days in which I was starting to feel better**. The nodes in my neck are already reducing, but for now, the glands in the other areas persist. The nodes are a bit painful to press on, but are movable and relatively soft.
* I have no other notable symptoms; no fatigue, shortness of breath or consistent fever.
* Although, I have woken up a bit warm/sweaty a few times when I was sick, but I figure that's pretty normal?

&#x200B;

* **Are my swollen glands (particularly in my armpit/groin) likely to be caused by a throat infection/cold?** I wouldn't really be worried if all my glands were synchronized in their swelling, or if online literature explicitly stated that this was a common thing. It's been suggested by my physician that I've probably had some other infection, unknown to me. Is this still a likely cause given the current situation? I'm just really trying to rule out some sort of lymphatic cancer for some peace of mind."
Back knee pain and stiffness,"I am a 24 years old female, no other health issues known. 

I woke up on Monday with the back of my knee hurting and the pain extends to the calf. It hurts when I fully straighten it or fully bend it. I can also feel something like a hardened tendon in the back of my knee. It feels basically like my leg is stiffened up and there’s a spring there which was pulled to the max. I went to the doctors and he just listened to my symptoms and said that I need to rest, apply some cream and take some ibuprofen. The pain lessened a bit (now it doesn’t hurt as much when I touch it because on Wednesday it hurt so much if I touched it with my finger) but it still hurts and I can’t walk properly. 

I’ve had this problem (but it hurt WAY less) some months ago after a horrible charley horse episode. It resolved by itself in about 3 weeks though.

"Laser, Numb Right Eye","Male, 30yo, non-smoker, non-drinker, no health issues, not on medication.

This happened at approximately 9pm, and it is now 4am. I have the eye covered with an old shirt. It felt like it was watery a bit.

UPDATE: Waking up at 8am, my eye still feels a bit numb, my vision doesn't seem to be blurry. There is also no afterimage present."
What's wrong with me?,"i am a 25 year old male and for the past 5 years or so (up to a few months ago) I have been smoking marijuana heavily daily with pretty much no breaks. When I discovered it at about the age of 19, I fell in love with it because I've always been an introvert, musician, art loving sort of person and it not only heightened my appreciation for art, but also allowed me to think outside the box in many ways. 

Over the years, it evolved from a tool that I used to help with art and music, to something I enjoyed for its own sake, to eventually something I used as a crutch to help me relax and fall asleep at night. It started to become an ugly habit. Around the time I started smoking weed, I also started drinking alcohol, but not very often. I would drink occasionally with friends or at family events. I liked it, but not as much as weed. over the years I started drinking alcohol more and more, maybe a few times a week, but never to the point where it became problematic.

Well, I eventually grew sick of the effect that weed had on my motivation, confidence, sex drive, and a few other things and decided it was time to either take a break or stop entirely before I ended up wasting my entire youth sitting in my room and getting high. It shifted from something that helped inspire and motivate me to do more creative things, to something that left me happy and lazy to the point where I had no desire to do anything outside of the bare minimum. I wasn't even making art or music anymore because it was too much effort.

 So, in late June of this year, I pretty much stopped cold turkey. things were going okay for the first few days, I could feel my old self coming back, but I was having difficulty sleeping and to be honest, I missed the feeling of being impaired after a long day of work, maybe just as a temporary escape from reality. But it wasn't worth losing my motivation and confidence so, I started drinking daily instead. it started with a few beers which eventually after a few weeks became several nippers to a small/medium bottle of liquor every night and sometimes early in the morning. 

This caught up to me very quickly and I began having pretty severe heart palpitations the next day after drinking which scared me because I've never really had any serious health problems. I would have episodes where my heart would start pounding in my chest, my neck would swell up, and my vision would become blurry. I feared that I was about to have a heart attack or seizure and eventually ended up in the emergency room one afternoon because I was so scared.

they did blood work, monitored my vitals for nearly 8 hours, and turned up nothing even remotely out of the ordinary. I followed up with my primary doctor who did more extensive tests, set me up with a heart monitor, and still said I was completely normal and healthy. since then, I have really slowed down a lot with drinking, a lot of the time not drinking at all which seemed to help a little bit with the episodes. my doctor prescribed me sleep meds so that I wouldn't have to abuse alcohol to fall asleep.

I started smoking weed again shortly afterwards during which period, the symptoms almost disappeared and I felt totally normal again, even with somewhat frequent (at most a few beers per night, usually not even that) drinking. I would have the occasional mild episode, but it wasn't really an issue. This lasted about 2 months which brings us to about 3 weeks ago or so.

while I felt great physically, I noticed that my issues with motivation and confidence were beginning to resurface so I decided it was time to stop, as I would rather have the tools to be successful and take control of my life than just feel good. so I stopped again, this time not falling back into the heavy drinking pitfall that I did last time because I had my sleep meds. well, it only took about a week for the episodes to come back and they have been worse than ever. in these episodes, I'm having heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, tightness in my chest, slight dizziness, and pain and tingling sensations in my limbs, and an overwhelming sense of dread. I stopped drinking completely which curbed the episodes somewhat but not completely (this was only a week ago). a few nights ago, I found half a joint on the floor next to my bed which I must have dropped at some point and forgot about, and decided to smoke it because why not? well that night, I had an anxiety attack which was accompanied by the worst episode yet which left me at my mom's house crying in the middle of the night thinking I was about to die. I eventually fell asleep and ended up feeling a bit better the next day, but in the past week I've had a constant tightness in my chest and shortness of breath which doesn't seem to go away at all.

What's wrong with me? my doctor says I'm perfectly healthy after extensive tests of my blood and heart and I'm confused. for the past few days I've avoided any kind of weed or alcohol consumption at all for fear of triggering another episode. the symptoms seem to match up with an anxiety or panic disorder, but that doesn't make sense to me because they pop up out of the blue and I'm not worried or anxious about anything. the episodes were initially triggered by a physical problem (presumably drinking way too much alcohol) but have persisted beyond that issue. will I ever be able to smoke or drink again? I'd like to be able to at least have a few drinks or smoke a bit with my friends or something but now I feel like I can't or I'll run into some serious health issues or something. if anyone has experienced or heard of anything similar please offer your insight because I am confused, scared for my health as the episodes have not stopped, and kinda depressed that I'll never be able to casually enjoy weed or alcohol like a normal person can (especially after using both heavily for years without any issues whatsoever).

then all of a sudden it felt like i wasnt getting enough air even though i was breathing fine, i kinda started panicking and got up and went into the bathroom. from there i could feel my lungs and throat get like a rlly bad feeling of like pins and needles, i think thats the best i could explain it. after that i started feeling like i was gonna pass out and started feeling a bit lightheaded.

about 5 min later it started to die down and i ended up being fine but just tired so i went and laid down, this same thing then happened again in the morning but way less worse then it was. this happened 2 times and june and came on randomly and hasnt happened since, can anyone help?"

My pain is my issue. I've only recently begun seeing a pain Specialist, who has made referrals for an MRI and a surgeon. The surgeon has recommended fusion of the cervical spine or removing one of the discs altogether. The wait time for this could be three years or more. Privately it's too expensive for me. I have compression at C456, impingement with osteophytes at T45, same again in lumbar region. Sacroiliac joints degenerating. Right hip pain. Has gotten worse over the years. Very much in pain now. It has difficult finding a regular Doctor. (I live in a training town and Dr's do six months placement then return to the cities.) The remaining doctors are overwhelmed. Lately I've been accused of being a drug seeker. One doctor googled 'how to recognize a drug seeking patient' while I was sitting there! Now I have a doctor who has said he isn't leaving, but have only seen him three times so far for prescriptions, so he doesn't know me yet. I used to be able to request paracetamol and codeine but in the last twelve months drs have refused to prescribe it, blaming the risk of an opioid crisis developing like the US and not knowing me as a patient, which was a catch 22 that no one cared about. Recently I asked my new doctor about prn analgesia and he has said (after reading surgeons report) ""you need surgery, pain killers won't be helpful"". I then asked about increasing my evening dose of Tapentadol, but he stated it's unsafe, as I work shift work and it will increase my fatigue! I tried to explain that I'm not sleeping well and I'm tired and the pain is becoming intolerable, to no avail. Please can someone help me? Do I stay with this new doctor and hope he changes his mind once he gets to know me and knows I'm not abusing drugs? Or do I look for another doctor and see if he has any better suggestions? I can't possibly live as I am now, it's exhausting! I'm dreading the future if this is the best they can offer! I work full time and want to stay active, but I'm failing fast as is. I need sleep and I need to get some relief from this relentlessness. What can I ask for? Would Targin be more helpful? Or something else? I need to be more assertive in my health care. I need to advocate for myself. Doctors do not have the time anymore to really know their patients. Any advice would be so welcome! Thank you in advance for any suggestions or feedback.

Throat discomfort following bullectomy/pleurodesis,"Age: 29

Gender: M

Height: 6'4""

Weight: 205lb

Race: Caucasian

Geographic location: Canada

Duration: 4-5 months

Symptom location: Throat, sometimes extending to upper chest.

History of several cases of spontaneous pneumothorax, VATS bullectomy/pleurodesis on left lung in 2010, right lung 2019. Despite the username, no diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.

Non-smoker, infrequent drinker.

**Symptoms and onset**

I had a VATS bullectomy and pleurodesis (using povidone-iodine) in May 2019, which presumably failed as soon as I left the hospital. I had a redo pleurodesis done upon a return visit in my hospital bed by injecting a D50W (dextrose saline solution) through the chest tube that had been inserted earlier in the ER.

A few days following the second pleurodesis, about a week after the prior surgery and around the time I was discharged, I started to develop some annoying throat symptoms. The closest term I've found online to describing it is ""globus sensation"". It feels like something is stuck in my throat. Sometimes it feels like if someone is pushing against my Adam's apple, and gets worse if I push against it or if I tilt my head down with my chin to my chest. Sometimes it subsides temporarily after eating, but doesn't go away with fasting. It seems less intense right after waking up. It sometimes feels like trapped gas and burping seems to make things feel better albeit briefly. The sensation occasionally extends from around the Adam's apple down to my upper chest.

**Differentials**

I'm reluctant to anchor a diagnosis, but some other details below:

My surgeon suggested it could be from the intubation, but it's been a long time since the surgery took place and the onset of symptoms wasn't until a week or so after. It also feels nothing like the burning throat pain I had with my first VATS in 2010, which went away within a day or two. Another doctor had me do a neck x-ray to rule out the very low possibility of pneumomediastinum, which I haven't heard back about so presumably those results are okay.

A GP initially thought it could be thrush and had me on Nystatin for two weeks which didn't seem to improve the situation. I was then put on PPIs for about two weeks which didn't help. I saw an ENT who didn't see anything wrong, but put me on PPIs again which I've been taking for about a month now with no improvement.

**Medications**

For pain management I was on Tylenol, Oxycodone and Gabapentin. I must have responded poorly to the Gabapentin because I felt absolutely miserable during the three days I took it. Not being sure, I discontinued all pain medication for a few days in the hospital, before starting Tylenol and Oxy again. From past experience, I respond best to Oxy. Doctors and nurses probably thought I was drug seeking when I mentioned Oxy specifically, so they ran me through an array of other pain medications like hydromorphone which were all ineffective for pain relief. I was taking some NSAIDs like naproxen prior to the NPO order and pleurodesis but not after. I took some stool softeners like senokot to deal with the constipation from the pain meds.

**Ideas?**

I have to wait until late November to see another ENT, from a referral given in late June. The long wait is pretty upsetting since the symptoms are really annoying. I'm getting kind of desperate and was hoping someone had ideas on what I could do to improve the situation.

My worry is that some sort of damage was done during the surgery that has gone overlooked. I had several chest tubes inserted and reinserted prior to finally getting the surgery done, which probably did my body no favours. I was also on a wide array of medications and spent several days on NPO while waiting for an opening in the OR.

"1 house, 4 deaths (one human 54M, three animals) in 1 year","Per the title, at my folks' house, there have been four deaths since 11/18. 

Most recently, an uncle that had moved in with them 8/19 passed away suddenly. He had been deprived of oxygen at birth, and as such had a TBI. He did not communicate any symptoms prior to passing. He was found lying on the floor with no externally visible symptoms. He had been around 200lbs, and had struggled with both diabetes and high blood pressure. He lived a completely sedentary lifestyle due to being unfit to work (walking at most between rooms, rarely if ever leaving the house due to fear of inclines). His body will be cremated without an autopsy. Cause of death uncertain.

His death comes as a surprise, though it's not shocking. However, it's a strange coincidence following the deaths of all three of their pets over a 9 month period. 

First, a medium sized dog died 11/18. I'm not privy to the cause. The dog was 10ish years old. Next, a cat died 3/19. Suddenly experienced nerve or neurological issues, including some event that caused one eye to go lazy. We put him down following said event. Next, a second cat died 6/19. We put her down following a scan that revealed widespread cancer.

The relatively likelihood of all of this happening so close together is making me paranoid that there might be exposure to something toxic in the house. It was built in the late 1960s, so lead isn't out of the question.

Could there be a common  contributing factor? Is this just a supremely shitty coincidence?

tl;dr: dog died 11/18, cat #1 died 3/19, cat #2 died 6/19, uncle died 10/19. Could it be lead poising or another silent killer?"

"A certain detergent smells bad for me, despite my family saying it smells fine","20 year old male, 6ft, 155 lbs, duration of complaint started about 4 months ago, but it worse since about a week ago.

So we got some Kirkland detergent from Costco and to me it kinda smells like a sweaty sausage. Just has a nasty warm kinda hotdog smell to it. Whats weird is that both my brother and I have smelled this before in late June. I figured it was his Body odor that got really bad, and he thought it was me. It lasted about a night and then went away. Later towards the end of August the same thing happened, we both smelled a nasty bad sausage odor that went away after a day or two. 

And now that brings us to today. I have been smelling that same gross kinda warm and sweaty, meaty smell, but very subtly. Whats really freaking me out is that my brother and other people in the house say they only smell the detergent, but I smell some nasty shit. I know its coming from the detergent because I walked past a rack of clothes and felt the rank scent, but when I got a little closer I also smelled the detergent. So I can smell the detergent, but only if I get really close to the source, but if its just kinda wafting in the air it smells like shit. 

Its driving me crazy because I spent the last 5 days scouring my room trying to find the cause of the smell but no matter what I move and clean, the smell keeps coming back...

&#x200B;

I think its important to note that I suffer from bad anxiety and have had some similar situations like this before.

Fall of 2018 I kept catching a whiff of smoke every here and there over a few months. And now this, my room is filled with some meaty stench that seems to be coming from the detergent and isn't bothering anyone else...

Is it possible that my anxiety is doing this, maybe some changes to the weather are making me more sensitive to smells or something??"
Persistent cough,"17f. No recreation drug use or smoking. I take 36mg concerta, 50 mg Zoloft, 200 mg riboflavin, 400 mg magnesium and 50 mg topimax. I also take Zyrtec for seasonal allergies. 

So I got a minor sinus infection two weeks ago. And I also got a cough. The cough is so severe that my abdomen hurts from coughing so much. I was given tessalon perles to help with the cough. But they only work for a short period of time and I am only allowed to take them every 8 hours. Whenever I have a coughing fit my temperature also rises to 99.3°f ( it's gone to this exact temperature at least once a day) my normal average temperature is in the lower  97s upper 96s. 

I cough up clear goop. But I don't have a runny nose or any feeling of drainage. I would use my inhaler but it got overheated during the summer and it actually made the cough worse when I tried it. My mom made me use her symbicort inhaler since it turned out all of our families  rescue inhalers were in the same bag as mine. Meaning they to got overheated.  It helped but I don't want to use her medicine.  I have been coughing for two weeks now and it's concerning."
Neck pain in certain contexts,"35f 5'3"" 140# Asian  
No medications, intoxicants on average once every 2-3 months. 

This has been part of my life since at least the time I was a teenager. My neck feels tense and painful mostly at the base of my skull in these contexts:

* When cold wind is blowing on my ears
* When I jog outside (on a treadmill indoors is fine)
* When I wear certain things on my head, like baseball caps
* When I wear certain glasses, like those red laser glasses that block blue light

There might be more contexts but I remember them right now.

I have a congenital fusion in my neck vertebra and my neck curve is basically straight with a slight reverse at the top, not caused by any particular incident. Some x-rays I had taken maybe a decade ago: [https://imgur.com/a/5J6Y9fV](https://imgur.com/a/5J6Y9fV)

I started wearing the red laser glasses again recently and in positions I don't feel neck pain, I immediately feel it once putting on the glasses. Sitting up in bed with the glasses on is mildly painful, walking around is more painful and quite bothersome.

I've had neck pain (and lower back pain if that's relevant) on and off (more off than on) since probably the same time. Again, no particular thing that caused it, but my first memory of noticing the back pain was when I was at work doing some ironing and I felt my back start hurting but I was too shy to let myself rest or ask for permission to rest so kept ironing while the back pain continued. No memory of the first time I felt neck pain, but the first one I can remember is being a teenager walking home from school on a windy day and my neck hurt.

Real aftercare advice for stitches after minor surgery,"26F, non-smoker, no meds, 5'9 160lbs.

Background: Currently living in Korea. Spiral fractured my outer right metatarsal during an unfortunate drunk dancing incident 6 weeks ago. They put pins in it to help it heal and I just had them removed yesterday - they were under the skin so they had to make an incision. I now have 2 stitches.

If there's one word I could use to describe Korean healthcare, it would be...EXTRA AS FUCK. Okay, that's 3 words, but they were needed. Like, before the surgery (which, I reiterate, was to put 3 tiny pieces of metal into my outer foot, they didn't even make an incision), they insisted on taking a chest x-ray, 2 different abdominal ultrasounds, and urine and blood tests. They were going to put me under general anesthesia for the surgery, but wound up doing an epidural. I was on a saline drip the entire time I was in the hospital with IV painkillers added after the surgery. They insisted on keeping me overnight and wanted to keep me for a second one (until the whole 50-our dose of painkillers was distributed), but I insisted that they let me go home (after which they told me that if I woke up in pain I couldn't come back to that hospital, I'd need to go to emergency). They gave me oral painkillers and I stopped taking them the day after I got home because I didn't need them, but they kept asking if I needed more whenever I'd go back for checkups (which they insisted on weekly at first and then biweekly for x-rays).

ANYWAY. They removed the pins with just local anesthesia yesterday, and wrapped the wound in what seems like an excessive amount of gauze and bandages. I had to come back this morning for them to change the dressing, which includes about an inch-thick layer of gauze, which the nurse wove between my toes, and then wrapped my entire foot over my heel and around my ankle. Normal procedure would apparently be for me to go back every couple days for them to redress it, but I'm going to be out of town for the next week so I insisted on doing it myself. I asked the nurse when I could shower normally (ie get the wound wet). He said - get this - two weeks. I refuse to believe that I need to be THAT cautious. Someone please give me real non-extra medical advice lol.

TL;DR: How long do I actually need to wait before getting stitches from a minor bone pin removal surgery wet (ie showering normally), and do I need to do anything special in terms of cleaning and dressing going forward, or is a big Band-Aid, rubbing alcohol, and Polysporin good enough?"

Am I allergic to Clotrimazole and Miconazole? (Photo link included),"Heads up, but this photo is a bit..gross. 

Yesterday morning  I woke up with the telltale signs of ringworm. The center looked like normal skin, with a thin circle around it. NOTHING like what the picture shows. It wasn't at all raw and inflamed. And didn't have this browning to it. The middle skin looked normal. 

 I went to the doctor and he said for me to get clotrimazole and Miconazole. If it didn't improve at all in two weeks he wanted me to come back for a persciprion of ketonazole (sorry if I spelled that wrong, going off memory) and something starting with a T. He said combination treatment would be best. 

Yesterday I did as he said and mixed a glob of each together on the area and a few cm around the ring, rubbing from the outside inwards as much as possible. Early this morning around 3AM I woke up with my foot stinging horribly. When I looked I saw..this. I called him and asked if I should come back in as it looks really irritated and gnarly but he insisted it was probably just healing and tends to get red and scaly when healing. After ONE day?  I don't know..I'm not buying it. Regardless, of what's said here I'm going to go to this urgent care like place tomorrow since I don't really trust this doctor's opinion. But I thought in the meantime I'd ask here. Should I stop using it for the night? Could it be an allergic reaction? Or am I being dramatic and this is totally normal? Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks.

It wasn’t until today I was lying down on my bed and wiggled my lower body to get comfortable, my head began to trigger the off balancedness even harder than ever. felt like I’m on a rocking boat, thinking it might be my bed shaking with me, I decide to lie down on the ground and start shaking my lower body left and right again and turns out it’s not the bed my head feels weirdly off balance around my mid section of my body thus making my head feel weird too.

"Filling meal + alcohol or sugar = heart pounding, gas, and indigestion for many hours...?","Hello all,

30F, 5'7"", 136lbs, non-smoker, no medications.

This is something I've talked to many doctors about, but everyone has been stumped. Ever since I recovered from a 5 year struggle with anorexia (about 5 years ago), I have found that if I drink alcohol after I've eaten a meal that is at all filling, or contains starchy carbohydrates/bread/etc., my heart will pound, and it will feel like my digestion will slow down dramatically, with my stomach getting very gassy- lots of belching/bloating and just generally feeling pretty miserable. This all lasts for **many hours**, unless I take digestive enzymes, which is the only thing I have found that helps.

If I drink alcohol (**no** cocktails/mixed drinks) on an empty stomach, or with a very light meal containing only protein and vegetables, I have no symptoms.

It was only more recently that I noticed that the same thing happens when I eat even a bite or two of dessert/sweet things after a filling/carby meal now, too.

Aside from this, my stomach, in general, is fine for small-medium sized meals alone, but seems like it can't handle meals over a certain size now (and I'm not talking about anything unreasonable here...), without feeling like it ""glitches"" and forgets how to move things along properly for many hours, with lots of gas and belching as a result.

I stopped drinking alcohol 5 years ago, and rarely eat sugary things anymore, because it's just so uncomfortable. Otherwise, I'm healthy (other than barely symptomatic PCOS) and active. My labs (blood sugar/regulation included) consistently come back totally normal/quite good. I've been tested for SIBO, Celiac, and a host of other food allergies, and am always negative. My gastroenterologist wants to do an upper endoscopy, but I was curious to reach out to this community in case it rung a bell for any of you. It's freaking me out on a certain level, and frustrating to no longer be able to enjoy these things.

Anyway, I'd love to hear from anyone if anything comes to mind! Thanks for reading if you made it this far. :)"
Neurologists - any idea what’s going on here?,"I am 26 and have had BFS since May. It all began around January of this year I was twitching in every muscle. To be clear, I have had some very “quiet” days sometimes consecutive. FWIW haven’t twitched in a few days. On the other hand some days, especially early on hundreds of twitchers I could feel. None that I couldn’t. Without an EMG, this lead to a BFS diagnosis after blood teats and routine labs were done to check for obvious imbalances. All was good, and the doctor wasn’t concerned. He spent sometime with me offered some solutions, but his general tone was that you may have this for eternity and that’s ok.

Around the same time, (and I’m not sure if it’s related, that’s why I want your opinion) my ring and pinky, on the left hand began seeming off, just off... That’s really all I can say to describe it. Fine movements are a bit challenging, like holding remotes, flashlights, even pens, and manipulating them is difficult. please keep in mind this has absolutely to do with being the dominant hand or not.
Arm movement is still fine and I am active both in handy things around the house and physical fitness. I haven’t not found a body weight movement or weightlifting movement I cannot do or even have trouble with.
It’s really just the smaller fine movements I have challenged with.

I followed up with the neurologist who once again checked reflexes as well as hand and arm strength. He tested the hands in a few ways and said it all looks good. He examined the muscles too. But recommended an EMG. He thinks I might have compression of the ulnar nerve.

I have had random aches in the forearm, inter dorsal muscle (the one between thumb and index finger), as well as numbness while sleeping on the forth and fifth digits.

I can still button my shirt and hold glasses. I haven’t dropped any and can still drive, unscrew tight caps.

I am slightly concerned about the EMG though I know thats a standard tests for carpal tunnel and ulnar.

the EMG won’t be for 6 more weeks and I’m the meantime, I’d just like to make sure there isn’t anything on the ALSside for me to worry about.

given I have been twitching 9 months, and it’s been 6 months post first visit with the neurologist, would ALS have progressed up the arm, or would my hand have been just completely useless by now?

Frenuloplasty advice,"Hi, I’m a Male, in his 30 years old, who is having frenulum issues. I got a really bad infection on my penis which I’ve had for over a year now last. Did a really stupid thing where I rolled my foreskin back and left it like that for a couple of hours, because I wanted to see what it would feel like. Within 2 hours my penis became really dry and sore so I rolled the foreskin over and thought nothing of it until the next day where my penis started to go red, itchy, skin peeling, cuts on my frenulum and burning sensation. Went to the doctors and turns out I got an infection. Go figure right. Anyways fast forward a year and I’m still battling this infection. Every time I use a prescribed cream, it works but the moment I stop using it, it come back. But my main problem is the frenulum, where there is a micro cut that just won’t heal no matter what. I’m now finally seeing a urologist and he has told me I’ll most likely need a frenuloplasty. It scares me but it’s the price I gotta pay I guess. I’m not exactly sure what to expect from this. How long will my frenulum take to heal? How do I clean the foreskin? What happens if this infection doesn’t go away and I’ll then need to get circumcised? Can the iridium it there and then etc.? It’s only on the frenulum that needs to have surgery. Has any patients on here had this done?"

Question about pain in left Quad after football game.,"Hey all, I'm 17 years old, male, and recently had a football. I'm talking about 5-7 hours ago. In one of the plays, I tackled someone, and had at least 2-3, extremely large people fall on me. I don't think that someone stepped on my quad, as I don't see any marks. However I did fall on my left side when I tackled the other player, and was in a decent of pain. And I was wondering if I could get a general idea on what it could be.

At first, it was just pain in my left quad every time I walked. It covered a large bit so it hurt quite a bit. After my game, and as I relax more, it's getting harder to fully extent my leg without hurting or walking without limping, with pain if I put any pressure on it. Is it possible that its just a extremely large bruise? Or would something much more serious be at play here."

Firstly I'd like to apologize for not understanding how to make a direct image post, but I'm worried and seeking an answer asap. My throat has been killing me all day, not only that but I have felt generally uneasy, weak, and under the weather. I havent been able to eat anything (forced down 4 french fries but thats it) in over 24 hours at this point. I sometimes get tonsil stones so I figured thats why my throat hurt and while trying to remove them I accidentally made myself throw up (not uncommon as i have shaky hands). At this point i immediately noticed the color and consistency of my vomit and got worried. Ive never seen this in person before but I'm not sure what else it could be.  It's almost 2am where I'm located, should I go to the ER??

Some more info if any of it helps I'm 6 foot 1 inch tall and weigh about 135 pounds, I'm white, I smoke marijuana on a daily to semi daily basis, and I had 3/4 of a beer around 9-9:30pm tonight while relaxing with my family.

"Recently diagnosed with MS, but my only symptom is Optic Neuritis, a few questions going forward.","So I’m male, 30, 5’9, 157 lbs, and I noticed a weird eye issue a few years back but it was only in my left eye and even though it went almost completely blind, it went back to normal after 14 days. I saw an eye doctor and they couldn’t diagnose it, but since it went away it hasn’t occurred since, so I left it alone. That was 2016. Fast forward to August of 2018 and a similar effect happens but this time to my right eye, not as severe as I still has good vision, but it didn’t go away. Went to PCP after 3 months, who suggested a neurologist. Neuro ran a few tests, MRI, spinal tap, all coming back positive for MS(I guess there’s a specific protein that shows up in spinal fluid?) The MRI showed a small blip but I guess that’s an early symptom too. 

After all tests were completed the neurologist suggested a few different types of medication ranging from least aggressive with less side effects to most aggressive with more side effects, but there’s is obviously no cure. I told him that since I don’t really have any other symptoms besides the eye, which is barely noticeable unless I workout super hard(vision lessens with aerobic exercise) I’d rather not start any meds unless some other symptom popped up, as I feel healthy in all other areas. He basically agreed but said the best coarse of action would be to come get an MRI every 6 months and if there’s any change then we start meds. 

Have any of you dealt with something like this and am I on the right path? I work a physical job and exercise in some form 3-5 days a week, aside from averaging 10-18k steps a day. Should I just start medication(can’t remember the name) or should I just keep this 6 month checkup deal going until something else arises? Should I try a different neuro and get a second opinion?"

Hi Reddit, I'm wondering if you can offer some advice on this one. I'm starting to get a little worried. At some point in the not-too-distant past I noticed that my body would occasionally do something really weird, following the exact same pattern every time. I randomly get nauseous for about 15-20 minutes, and I feel like throwing up. But then, that passes and I suddenly start feeling really weak and shaky. I get super hot and begin sweating, in addition to craving (and I mean REALLY craving) sugary food. I have a bit of a sweet tooth anyway, but I can't stress enough how badly my body feels like it NEEDS these foods during these times. It literally feels like I might die if I don't get them into my system fast enough, but because I'm so weak, it's a huge challenge just to stand and drag myself upstairs to the kitchen. But once I do get a bowl of cereal, a banana, etc, I eat like it's my last opportunity. The last time this happened I swear I must have devoured half a bag of Halloween candy in under five minutes. I just eat like CRAZY, and that seems to do the trick, because once I get that sugar in my body I start feeling a lot better. 

I've been trying to think if there's anything that tends to precede these episodes. For one, this always seems to happen in the evening, maybe 2-4 hours after I eat dinner. Usually it only happens every few months, but it's happened twice within the past couple weeks, which is why I'm kind of scared. I really hope this doesn't start becoming a regular thing. I'm absolutely terrified I have diabetes or something. My paternal grandmother has it, so I'm worried sick I might have it or be developing it. Is this kind of thing normal in people without diabetes?"

doxycycline hyclate allergic reaction?,"Hello,
I’m a 22yr old male. 155lb. I recently started taking 100mg doxycycline hyclate twice a day for acne. As well as well as tretinoin & clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide. The first day I threw up the first pill after taking it on an empty stomach. The second pill I took at night. The third I took at 10am the following morning. At 7pm I began to turn red and felt burning sensation in my hands that eventually spread to my arms, back and upper thighs. Minutes prior to the outbreak I took a pre-workout drink for the second time ever. I drank Benadryl and that got rid of the reaction. Could this be a late allergic reaction to the doxycycline hyclate or might it have been brought on by the pre-workout drink?

My throat is still sore, now I‘ve got jaw pain, neck pain, sinus pain, groin pain, arm pain, and fatigue. Should I have seen an ENT first? Is their endoscopy that different from a gastroenterologist? My throat hurts like it’s laryngitis, but I’m not sick like a cold. My doctor is telling me it’s anxiety. But this sore throat isn’t imaginary, and it’s not going away. If I’m feeling pain in my jaw and elsewhere in my body, is it spreading? It took months just to get negative results on my colonoscopy and endoscopy. How much longer will it take to diagnose this problem? Is there even a point to try and treat it now? I‘m having foggy thinking. Can someone help with some useful advice.

"Diagnosed in 2016 with piriformis syndrome. Now in 2019, I have have problems","For starters, I am a 19 year old male, 6’ 180 lbs, no smoking what so ever and rarely drink. Also moderately active. I was diagnosed in 2016 with piriformis syndrome. For those of you that don’t know what it is, its pretty much the piriformis muscle in the butt aggravating the sciatic nerve. I remember going to the hospital and getting diagnosed. Instead of my aunt helping me getting something like physical therapy set up or something, I was only prescribed an Anti inflammatory medicine and was told it would go away.  Well, it hasn’t gone away.  It’s like it has flair ups randomly. I won’t be doing anything that will flair it up, it just comes on its own. I’ll do fine for like 3 months and wake up one day to my butt killing me. It’s like an intense pain in the joint and sorta feels like one leg is shorter than the other bc I limp when I walk while it’s hurting.  I’m beginning to think it is something besides piriformis syndrome because in almost all cases, the pain travels down the leg, but for me, it stays in the butt,  and it also swaps which side hurts randomly. It’s never both sides. One day it’ll be the left side. 2 months from now it might be the right. It doesn’t matter how I sleep, it’ll act up on its own.   I’ve done stretches that I’ve found online to help, but they don’t work.  I basically just have to put any physical activity off until it goes away on its on. I’m currently 19 and I don’t have insurance, but I know I need to find the root of this and get it fixed. What should me my main course of action? Go to a physical therapist to get a more current diagnosis and pay out of pocket? Go to a doctor?"

Im quite desperate, I've had it like this for almost 2 years now. I take betablockers are morning and at night but it makes no difference.

Makes it hard to engage in a sexual relationship and any relationship for that matter, or even relaxing is almost impossible. 

I was once hugging my girlfriend after watching the cinema and she could feel my heart beating through my jacket against her ear.

I cant find any info if bloodpressure is the main cause of this issue or if there is something else. All my heart scans have came back normal, and my doctor does not seem to take my bloodpressure and pulse seriously. I once had 180/130 bp, 120 pulse one morning at the doctor."

I have trigeminal neuralgia that causes migraines. I sometimes have to go to the ER when my home meds/nerve blocks don’t offer relief.

I’ve asked my neuro if I can be prescribed the Ketorolac for home use to further limit ER trips and he’s  extremely hesitant about it because of the risks. When I’ve read about it, it mainly looks like a risk of GI bleeds but I’m wondering if my neuro is just being overly cautious or if oral ketolorac really is that dangerous. I trust my neuro and he’s always willing to work with me but I know his facility is undergoing a lot of changes right now so I don’t know if that might be factoring into his hesitation? Any additional  information  about this medication would be greatly appreciated, I feel like I’m missing something when I’m reading up on it because I don’t have any risk factors that are addressed in the side effects.

My GP is sending me to a neurosurgeon, but I still haven't heard from the office. I am hoping to send images and reports elsewhere since my Dr made it sound serious.

Any interpretations/suggestions/explanations.. Just anything is very much appreciated."
Can someone tell me what this CT report means?,"So I am a MS-2 in a Medical school in USA and while I know what this can be, I am literally shitting bricks and would like someone to tell me is there is anything good about my 62 year old dad's CT scan report. He has no symptoms, all his labs are normal, his doctor said we can get another CT done in a couple of months but he is planning on requesting a MRI when he sees him in 5 days. He has never smoked or had alcohol.

"Drug-induced QT Prolongation, a little advice and hopefullt a little more reassurance please.","I’m 30yrs, White Female, 5”10, BMI 40+, No Drink, No Drugs, Social Smoker, Moderately Active. 

Medications I take;
Venlafaxine 150mg XR. Once daily. 
Fexofenadine 180mg, Once daily. 
Fluticasone 27.5mcg Nasal Spray
Omeprazole 20mg. Once Daily. 
Cyclizine 10mg - PRN for when I occasionally get a migraine, as I get nauseous, I rarely take it. Perhaps <2 times per month. Depends if I catch my migraine in time with OTC meds before it gets to that. 

Other medications I regularly take (OTC): Sometimes Co-Codamol 8/500mg & Ibuprofen 400mg for migraines.

Chief complaint: QT Prolongation
Relevant History: Depression, Acid Reflux, ADHD (unmedicated), Sinus issues. 

No cardiac history, no family cardiac history except my mum has AF which is related to her own endocrine history. I have had occasional palpitations in the past. I honestly thought they were to do with my reflux as I have reflux which causes a cough which usually proceeds a flutter. They resolve as quickly as they arrive and never any syncope or dizziness. They are rare. No hypertension, HR normal.

Basically I have had to go cold turkey (commenced 3 days ago) of Venlafaxine for major depression because it has caused a QTc of >490, I don’t remember the actual figure, but two weeks prior it was >460, so was borderline at that stage, but rising. It has been hellish coming off Venlafaxine (any advice on how to manage this wold also be fabulous) and I feel like I’ve been hit by a lorry but obviously a QTc that’s literally running away from me can cause bigger issues than Venlafaxine withdrawal. 

My next appointment with GP is on the 16th of Oct just to make sure I am ok with coming off the Ven and atm I am seeing her regularly anyway as my mental health has been a shitshow this year. I am getting an ECG but doubtful it will be prior due to availability at my GP surgery, but will probably be that week sometime, so two weeks from now. 

I am just wondering if I have gone cold turkey from Venlafaxine two weeks prior to the ECG am I expected to see a drop in QTc back to normal or does it not work that way or that quickly? I have been an anxious mess over this and obviously hit google as soon as I came away from the appointment this week as I didn’t know what to ask at the time. The GP has sent my ECG to the cardiologists to review in the meantime, I didn’t ask why I’m assuming to get a confirmation on the QTc? I’m also wondering do drug-induced QTc prolongation usually only happen in people with underlying QTc prolongation anyway? I can’t get a straight answer online as I don’t really have enough knowledge to interpret what I’m reading, and my anxiety is getting the better of me on this. 

If anyone can give me any advice on this that would be great, my nerves are shot and after I’ve received any useful advice on this here I’m just gonna put it to bed and try not to think about it until my next appointment. 

Thanks 🙏"
Slight toenail clubbing,"Hi. I seem to have some slight curvature on my 2nd and 3rd toes on each foot. It seems similar to clubbing however it's only present on those toes and my fingernails are completely fine. Is this just the way they've grown or should I get checked? Unfortunately it wouldn't let me add a photo. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Weird heart rhythm that follows a pattern,"I can see the beats with my phone. It's not just heart palpitations, because it's beating regularly in this way. It has happened a few months back for a few minutes, but today it's going at it all day basically. It's like a normal beat then a smaller, weaker one quickly after, and then pause. That's how it's going, small intervals. No pain but definitely feeling some tightness and discomfort, it feels unnatural. I am a 19 year old male and I have mitral valve prolapse."
Worried a mole I have is melanoma,"Full disclosure, I am going to see my Primary Care on Tuesday to get their opinion and possibly a referral to a dermatologist, I just wanna know how likely this is to actually be melanoma or skin cancer, it's been making me panic non stop.

I'm 19/M, Caucasian, and have no family history of having skin cancer. 

I've had this mole for a few years, and I remember it being darker back then, and now I check back at it a few days ago and it appears lighter now. I have no idea if it got lighter within a few weeks, months, or even years, I keep looking at it and it keeps seeming fainter colored than my other moles, but it doesn't look bigger or anything. It hasn't changed shape, it's not raised above the skin at all. My only concern is that it seems lighter than it used to, and that to me, it looks like the outlines are faint and it's multicolored since it looks like there's white in it. It's no bigger than a pencil eraser, either.

I'm going to the doctor on Tuesday to get their advice, and I know that if it is melanoma, I'd be treated, but in the back of my mind I keep thinking of the possibility of it having spread beyond the mole and to other parts of my body too, and that I'll die from it. I just feel anxious as all heck about this and need some temporary reassurance, if there is any, before my appointment. I keep thinking about how rare the cancer is for my age, but the possibility is still there, and I feel dumb for having not checked it. Everyone I talk to says it's normal too, but I don't really know if I believe them."
My sister has something wrong with her.,"My sister is 42 years old, and a few months ago she went on vacation and had an episode where she thought she was having a stroke, she got sick to her stomach, and felt unable to speak, and also felt faint. She went to a hospital there, but they didn’t have much to help her there. She ended up recovering, and came home to America.  She went to her doctor and they determined that she must have had an allergic reaction to an Anti nausea medication she had taken. Fast forward a few months, and she went to take a shower and had lifter her arms above her head, and she said they became very cold, now everytime she lifts them up they are cold. She also lost balance and fell. She had another episode a few months after that where her heart started going crazy, and she felt sick and faint again. On a regular basis, she gets these brain shakes that wake her up every morning. The tip of her tongue and fingers are always tingly and numbish. Her vision is a little blurry, and every time she has a major episode she said she feels weak for days afterwards. She has had blood work done, an mri, and now is wearing a heart monitor for the next month. The doctors don’t yet seem to know what is at all wrong. I’m so terribly worried about her, and was wondering if anyone has any kind of idea to what these symptoms could possibly be. All her tests have come up clear. Thank you so much in advance for any insite you can possibly give.  Her she is 42, she is about 115 lbs, 5ft 1."
