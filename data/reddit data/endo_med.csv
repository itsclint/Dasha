3,Enclomiphene for Testosterone,"There’s an updated version of the drug clomid called Enclomiphene which is a single isomer of the original drug. It works by antagonizing estrogen receptors in the pituitary gland inhibiting estrogen negative feedback and raising gonadotropin hormone that raises testosterone. 

Great, and it certainly does because my testes balloon up, and I can def feel the increase in strength and muscle mass. The part that’s strange is that it feels emotionally very different than trt.. in that I feel emotionally blunted not apathetic but just an overall numbness my nerves are calm, I feel much more grounded and calm and collected whereas trt or even naturally I’d be more social and active.. I wonder if antagonizing estrogen receptors causes this? 

Estrogen is correlated with serotonin, could it be effecting this? Any endo experts or people with experience?"
4,Desperate,"Been going to all types of specialists since youth for stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, sleep issues, temrepture regulation issues, anxiety, depression, irritability, joint pain.

Been officially diagnosed with GAD, depression, autism, adhd, fibromyalgia, anaemia (same as my mum we both don’t get b12 from food and need injections) and hypermobility syndrome. Three different adhd meds made me feel even worse (palpitations, confusion, shaky ness and chest spasms recently) so my private clinical psychiatrist said he would refer me to an endocrinologist. Then, as before, he didn’t put in the report what he said he would. 

I am so desperate to not be in pain or feel sick anymore I don’t want to be alive just want to not hurt my family, please help me"
5,"18 male - 5’4. Still got 2-3 years growth. Do I actually have to have a lack of HGH to have any kind of treatment? father: 5’11, Mother: 5’2","So I originally went to my GP who made me do a blood test to which the results were good in the sense that my body was perfectly healthy, but because of that he concluded my growth plates had closed and that treatment wasn’t possible. I searched online and I decided to get a private x-ray to see if my growth plates 100% had closed as this matter is extremely personal to me for so many years. 
The x-ray approved by two professionals concluded I still had 2-3 years growth left in me.
But it just seems like I’m not growing, I am so so so so slowly but that’s it! And I’m sorry but it’s extremely hard to accept as people often tell me to when I know that there is treatment out there. 
I tried for treatment when I was younger and I was put on some project but this kept on constantly getting delayed till they eventually cancelled the project for all patients and thus I got no where.
I haven’t been diagnosed with depression or anything but I’ve felt extremely down about this for as long as I can remember as there’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think about it. Sucks also when my younger sibling is taller and my older brother it 6’1 :(.

Do I take these results back to my GP or do I actually have to have a lack of HGH for any treatment to be possible?? Or is there any other treatment ? I’ll literally do anything

Any any help is hugely appreciated."
6,"31F with VERY low dhea-s04, androsten., estradiol, prog. & testosterone","All of those incredibly low, as in ""post-menopausal"" according to a chart that accompanied the results from my doctor.

I am a normal weight and I've had 2 children before a few years ago. My TSH hovers around 2.5 nobody will treat it i assume it's good enough. I am having repeated miscarriages now, but i still ovulate every month naturally on day 14 and get my period on day 28. I don't see how my hormones can be SO BAD and post-menopausal-seeming but i still ovulate and menstruate like clockwork. One thing that has changed in the past few years is that my skin is suddenly very wrinkly and seriously hangs off of my body now. Its like my fat is liquid rather than jello like it was when i was younger, and so my skin just ""pools"" when i sit or lay down. Some parts of my body seriously look like a 60 year old woman. This was not the case 3 years ago

My fertility specialist is treating this as some sort of PCOS variant (????!! What the dang heck?? I have no abnormal cysts) But i think I need to see a general endocrinologist and not a reproductive endo at this point, since its ALL of those hormones and maybe my whole adrenal system is messed up here. 

Can anyone give any insight?"
7,Prepping for an Endocrinology Course,"Hi all,

I'll be taking an Endocrinology course next semester, and my Physio is a bit rusty in general. What are some useful resources that you recommend for prepping for the course?"
8,"Not sure what's wrong with me. Can't handle food more than 150 calories at time without severe anxiety, restlessness.","I'm making this post because I'm desperate, and the wait times to see an endocrinologist where I live is 3+ months. I don't want to have to wait that long, because my problem is progressing every day. I've done hours and hours of research on this problem but literally can't find anything.

About 8 months ago I tried out the ketogenic diet. Was eating a very large amount of fat and protein (didn’t measure), and no carbs. After about a week I on it I started getting these like extremely uncomfortable rushes of energy if I ate too much fat, so I went off the diet. When I added carbs back into my diet again, I still would get the rushes if I ate more than a small amount, so I slowly introduced them back into my diet with very small portions and eventually I worked my way up and after a couple of weeks and then I’d say everything was 95% back to normal. Then I had a rough week, went on a bit of a food binge (junk food, candy, fast food, etc) and when I came off it and returned to my regular diet I noticed I was getting the energy rushes again, not only when eating fat but now they would happen regardless of what I ate. (or how much) I also noticed that if I ate more than a very small portion of food at a time (similar to when I went off keto) I’d start feeling extremely anxious, restless, and wired. That feeling is ongoing, will go on forever, if i leave it. It only is relieved when I eat a 100-150 cal portion (has to be at least 45 min after the last time I ate), which will make me feel relaxed and normal again. This has been happening for 8 months now. I could tell as soon as it started happening that it was putting an enormous amount of stress on my body. I thought blood sugar problems at first but I got fasting insulin bloodwork done and it was fine and I’m also in good shape psychically. The only thing I can say is that I am pretty sure it's somehow related to my adrenals.

This had literally been wreaking havoc on my health. Since this happened, it's been putting an enormous amount of stress on my body. It's causing me to get weaker by the day. At this point, I don't have the energy to leave the house, and walking up and down the stairs can make me really tired. I don't have proof this is the cause of that, however I was fine before this and since the exact day it started, I've been slowly getting worse.

Edit: I should also mention that I have a mood disorder (Cyclothymia). It might be possible that it's somehow related."
9,Advice to increase Testosterone (without steroids),"I had blood work done, posted here a while ago, My testosterone is low but not alarmingly so according to UK NHS to prescribe me any test boosters.. 

310pmol (free test)
14 nmol (serum test) 
All other bloods normal including estrogen

Due to two injury's I have been unable to exercise the past 12 months, next week is the first time I can exercise so hoping that in itself increases my T levels... Anything else you can recommend me ? I have heard ZMA suppliments can rise natural levels ? 

I want to stay away from steriods etc"
10,Friend (25F) with nonexistent sex drive and incredibly low T levels,"Hi r/endocrinology. I have a friend in distress. 

She has never in her life experienced any kind of sex drive, or sexual attraction, and classifies herself as a biromantic asexual.  
I have observed her and noticed she has the smoothest, most hairless skin I have ever saw. She told me she had never had even one pimple. I attach a blood hormone levels test she took a couple years back. As you can see, the T levels are, if I'm not mistaken, on the level of a pre-adolescent girl.  
Sexual stimulation, of any kind, but especially genital, is uncomfortable and doesn't give her any pleasure, at best.  
This causes her much stress and causes tension in romantic relationships, obviously.   
She told me her ovaries are pretty much in working order, if that's important.  
What could be the source of this? How can it be treated?   
She's not able to get a doctor's consult right now, so I'm asking you before doing anything else - including shelling out some cash myself to get her to a doc. She's really suffering, any answer may be helpful.

11,Abnormally high estrone,"I am looking for any insight as to why I might have elevated estrone levels. I am a 36-year-old transgender woman who was assigned-male-at-birth. Before starting hormone replacement therapy earlier this week, my PCP did labs to determine my pre-HRT hormone levels. Most were consistent with a cisgender male, as expected, but my estrone was significantly elevated. I'm concerned now that estrone levels could continue to climb into dangerous levels now that I've begun HRT (but I am also very reluctant to stop now that I've begun, as transition is important for managing my gender dysphoria). I would like to determine what might be causing these elevated levels so that my HRT regimen can be better managed around this abnormality.

I spoke online with a doctor who specializes in transgender medicine who suggested that ""this is clearly some sort of disorder of sexual development"", but the exact nature of which is outside of his realm of expertise.

To the best of my knowledge, my estrogen levels have never been tested before. I did have my testosterone tested about 6 years ago and it was within normal male range (though I don't have the exact numbers available). I had that testing done because of some erectile dysfunction I was experiencing at the time (which seemed to resolve itself). I have been experiencing erectile dysfunction again recently, but that seems to coincide with starting finasteride (which has ED as a known possible side effect) to address male pattern baldness. I also wanted to bank sperm before beginning HRT, but found that my numbers were incredibly low: a count of 1.5 million and a motility of just 17%. Another possibly related factor to all of this is that I required surgery shortly after I was born for a hernia and undescended testicle. And, in case it helps, I'm 5'11"" tall and 241 lbs (actively working on losing weight through diet and exercise).

Here are my hormone levels (but please let me know if there are other values from my labs that may be useful):

* DHEA sulfate, 236.9 ug/dL
* Estradiol, 32.2 pg/mL
* Estrone, 180 pg/mL
* FSH, 5.7 mIU/mL
* LH, 5.83 mIU/mL
* Progesterone, 0.29 ng/mL
* Prolactin, 7.2 ng/mL
* Testosterone (total), 350 ng/dL
* Testosterone (free), 54%"
12,Need help. Found an old test result. Going to endocrinologist on the 3rd. High 17OH at 16 while on BC? Now 21.,
13,Low LH levels but normal FSH levels,My doctor said she'd never seen that happen before and said she'd email someone in gynaecology I asked if it could be to do with the pituitary gland or hypothalmus and she said absolutely not otherwise all my hormones would be affected. The only other one which is slightly low is SHBG. Anyone had this happen/ know of the cause?
14,Lithium levels affect on thyroid (and dropping doses),"I'm curious if anyone knows what effect lowering lithium will have on my thyroid, or levels.  I was on 1200mg of lithium, it's being lowered to 1050mg.  I've been on it for 15 years, and also on alternating doses of levothyroxine for most of that time.  Right now I'm stable (I've had issues before) at 2.5 TSH.  Any worry that this would all push me into being hyperthyroid (this my chief concern, really, as I've had it happen before and it wasn't pleasant). Thank you!"
15,What's the consesus about steroid users practice of PCT-ing?,"I am just curious and I am not a user myself, but it seems like there is not much scientific literature on the subject.

After utilizing exogenous testosterone, steroid users will often run a Post Cycle Therapy (take clomid/nolvadex).

Does this have any backing by endocrinology? From what I've read, doctors will usually tell the users to quit taking anything and let the body do the job of recovering by itself. This is in stark contrast to what anabolic abusers believe.

My questions are:

\- Is it true that if one wouldn't do a PCT, they will possibly recover worse than if they did take these medications?

\- Is it actually more beneficient to take the PCT drugs as opposed to quitting cold turkey?

\- How long does it take for the body to start LH/FSH production after cessation of a long testosterone ester (such as Enanthate?)

\- How long does it take testicles to start responding to the raised LH/FSH levels?

What's the best practice for patients who need to discontinue a long-term TRT programme? Are they told to just quit cold turkey or is medicine being administered?

Is taking the SERMs just delaying the inevitable crash? (meaning that they help on short term, besides the nasty side effects, but then the body will hit rock botton anyway after discontinouing it?)

I was unable to find any reputable sources that could answer the questions and it's amazing how much broscience exists around the subject."
16,I am a 15 year old teenage boy and still haven’t begun puberty what should do?,"I am 15 and only 5,0 and 110 pounds a sophomore in hs I’ve had no signs of puberty once so ever my genital size has not grown etc etc I am getting worried even though my parents tell me they were both late bloomers."
17,"I am considering giving my 9 year old son, who is very short for his age, growth hormone therapy. But I am concerned because he is not GH-deficient, and I have read that there are risks involved with giving GH injections to children who are not GH deficient. Would appreciate any feedback.","I am 5'9"". My wife is 5'2"". Our 9 year old son is very short for his age (3'11""). He has been tested, and his GH level is normal, and his bone age is 7.5 years. We have been told by two separate doctors that he is trending toward the 5'0-5'2 territory in height.

We also have a 12 year old son who was short for his age at 9 (though not quite as short as his brother). The older boy has caught up to his classmates, and is now average in height.  But we have seen no growth spurt from our younger son, and we are concerned. We have seen two endocrinologists, both of whom specialize in children, and both recommend starting the 9 year old on Humatrope growth hormones.  

HOWEVER, the 9 year old has normal levels of GH in his system. And we have read that for kids who have ISS (idiopathic short stature), but who do NOT have a GH deficiency, giving growth hormone injections can carry serious risks such as diabetes, osteoporosis, increased risk of stroke, and an enlarged heart. 

When I raised these concerns with the doctor, he said that it was nothing to be concerned about, and that growth hormone injections are ""additive, not cumulative."" meaning that my son's body would naturally shut down its own GH creation once the injections were administered, and there would not be any issue with a surplus of GH in his system (I am paraphrasing what he said so I may not have it verbatim, but that was the gist of it).  

With a push from the doctor, our insurance company has agreed to pay for the GH injections. Using the [Open Payments Data tool](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/), I have learned that both of my son's endocrinologists have received $50,000 in ""consulting fees"" from big pharma companies. That sounds bad, but is it? He is a specialist, and he does, I assume, ""consult"" with these companies. Or should I see that as proof that he just prescribes treatments that could be risky because it is profitable to him?  

Additionally, I have read reports that state kids who receive GH injections, but are not low in natural GH to begin with, may experience a growth spurt over the first year, but that is simply ""borrowing"" future growth, and that [the final adult height of such kids may be not be changed much, if at all.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790327/)

>More recently, van Gool et al (79) have reported that high dose GH therapy in prepubertal children with ISS does not improve adult height, as it increases height gain during treatment but, at the same time, accelerates bone maturation, resulting in a similar adult height compared with the untreated controls.

My wife is worried that my son will be extremely short as an adult, and this will negatively impact every aspect of his life, socially, professionally, etc. So she very much wants to start him on the GH treatments immediately. I am also concerned about the negative effects of his being extremely short, but I am reluctant to use GH treatments given the fact that his body is not GH-deficient. Any advice that we could receive would be most appreciated. Thank you!"
18,Inaccuracies in pituitary blood tests?,"Inaccuracies in pituitary blood tests?

An endo said to me to perform an insulin tolerance test as regular bloods could prove unreliable.

My concern is levels of T3 which showed up fine in regular bloods, but I can't get the specific figure for the insulin test.

Is T3 an actual pituitary related hormone vs TSH/ T4 etc?

Cause I know it's the product of metabolized T4.

Would an insulin stress test be used to test for T3?"

20,Thyroid Agenesis // low T-cells,"My 6 year old son (who is generally doing well at the moment) was born without a thyroid. We also found by about a year old that he has chronic low lymphocytes.  It seems to affect the way his body fights certain viruses. We’ve battled HSV-1 cold sores weekly/monthly and even eczema herpeticum. Thankfully his super sever eczema is generally under control, but cold sores are still an issue, especially when he gets sick. 

Anyway, the Endo doesn’t know how the thyroid could be related to his immune system directly and his immunologist doesn’t know of a direct correlation either, as the cellular immune deficiency and congenital hypothyroidism aren’t usually comorbid. 

Any chance when his thyroid was failing to develop, his thymus development might have had some issues too? I’ve asked all his docs but no one seems to know enough to give a solid answer. 

His CD4/CD8 ratio bobbles just above 1. Thankfully never dipping below as the doc said that’s when he would be more worried.

22,"No PCOS, no thyroid issues, but elevated DHEA-S with seemingly no cause...what now?","Gonna try to make a long story short. A little over a year ago my hair started falling out at a pretty alarming rate. Around this time I also developed anxiety for seemingly no reason (never had anxiety prior), became super lethargic, foggy, having trouble focusing, don't have the best memory, trouble sleeping, and irritable. I went to a general practitioner and she ran blood tests, but everything looked fine and she said it was probably stress. At the time I did have some stress due to taking a job, and moving to a new city for it, that turned out to be a big mistake. Still, I didn't think that was quite it, and the hair loss was causing me major stress and anxiety (still don't know if the stress/anxiety are a cause of the hair loss, or the hair loss is causing the stress/anxiety).  I went to a dermatologist who was basically in the room for about 30 seconds, took a quick look at my hair and had me take a blood test to check my ferritin levels. That was within normal range, but on the lower end so she prescribed iron. After months that had done nothing for the hair loss, or any other symptom. 

Fast forward about 8 months, to July of this year. I'm still having all of the above symptoms, and I also have some minor hair growth where I shouldn't - definitely have to wax my happy trail on my stomach and I have a few aggressive hairs on my chin and upper lip. I went to a new OBGYN for an annual, but also told him about my symptoms. He wanted to rule out PCOS, so we did blood tests and an ultrasound. I have a polyp in my uterus, but no ovarian cysts. Only thing on the blood tests that were abnormal was my DHEA-S. It was 583. My OBGYN said above  270 µg/dL was out of range. Since it was so high, he had me do another blood test after fasting. This one had gone down, but was 380. He could tell that I was still freaking out about losing my hair, and he said that elevated DHEA-S can cause male pattern hair loss in women (which is the type I appear to have, based on how I'm losing it), so he referred me to an endocrinologist. She ran more blood tests to check my testosterone and some other stuff, as well as the DHEA-S, and had me do a thyroid ultrasound because she thought she felt a nodule on my thyroid. She said she'd take a look at the tests and I could consider birth control or spironolactone, but said my hair growth isn't that bad so I probably wouldn't need that. I had read many times that spiro could be used to help regrow hair on your head when you have high DHEA-S, so I thought that's what she meant. She corrected me, saying it doesn't help regrow lost hair but helps decrease unwanted hair in women (like lip, face, etc.). Anyway, a week later the nurse practitioner called me and said the ultrasound was negative, all blood tests were normal, but DHEA-S was still elevated, this time at 439. I inquired about that spiro stuff and she said my levels weren't \*that\* high and I don't have PCOS, so I didn't need it. She told me I don't need to see them any more and to just follow up with my OBGYN. No advice, no answers, no direction. Pointless. 

So, here I am. No real answers, and more questions about this elevated DHEA-S, and still going fucking bald. Based on the loss over the last year, I'm pretty terrified as to what it's going to look like in another year. Not to mention all these other weird symptoms I've been having that are definitely out of character. I don't know what I should do now - should I get a second opinion from a different endocrinologist? I wasn't really a fan of the one I went to, and soon I'll be getting insurance through my job and can ditch the shit, bottom of the barrel HMO that I currently have. Any advice on next steps would be greatly appreciated. Also, I failed at not making this too long."

1. Does Finasteride cause comprehension issues, retention issues, attention problems, and memory loss?
2. Will my cognitive abilities go back to normal once I cease taking finasteride?
3. What do I do to deal with/remedy the comprehension issues, retention issues, attention problems, and memory loss?

I took finasteride a month ago but just ceased taking them just recently. Finasteride is a hair loss drug that inhibits 5-alpha reductase so it wont turn into (or help make?) DHT.

The reason behind this is that I had comprehension issues, retention issues, attention problems, memory loss,  during the time I was taking it.

When I read a text, I could understand it in one reading. Buy when I took the finasteride, I noticed that I had to reread some parts as I was failing to comprehend what I was reading.

I also find it hard to retain information that I learned through conversations. Like when someone tells me the name of a person (the subject of out conversation), I sometimes fail to remember the person's name 5 minutes after.

I noticed that I forget the names and information, e.g. names and words, that I would usually remember off the top of my head before taking finasteride.

Finally, I observed that my mind isn't as sharp anymore. Previously, I would find it easy to recall the proper words to use and the names of person I meet.

25,Hi! I have asked a couple of times but didn’t get a lot of traction. What are your concerns about an 8 year old taking Lupron shots or having an implant to delay puberty. 8 year old for sure wants this and I am trying to do the dr google thing. She will start her period within the next few months.,
26,"Hi! My 8 year old just had her appt and we found out she is a 2 on the tanner scale. They did blood work and X-ray of her wrist. We go back in two weeks. We talked about her getting Lupron shots. Any advice, thoughts or ideas? Apparently she began puberty at age 7. I’d love any info or experience.",We have hormone issues in my family. Her pediatrician and endocrinologist both encourage treatment to buy her a couple of years. Are the side effects awful? Thanks so much!
27,Facetious Hyperthyroidism,
28,Would an endocrinologist help me or would I be wasting my time and money?,"I'm very frustrated with hypothyroid right now. My GP put me on 25 mcg levothyroxine 8 weeks ago. These are the lab numbers I had:

BEFORE:

>TSH - 5.7 (rr .350-4.940)  
>  
>T4 Free - 1.04 (rr .70-1.48)

After:

>TSH - 4.569  
>  
>T4 Free - .90

Negative for both types of antibodies, serum iodine normal, and I had an ultrasound that showed a 4mm nodule but otherwise nothing notable.

So the levothyroxine for some reason made my T4 *worse*. I don't feel any better or different. I wanted to try 50mcg but they said no because the results are ""in range"" and wanted me to stay on 25mcg even though it's making my T4 worse. Would an endocrinologist be able to help or would they just say the same thing?

Otherwise I'm just going to stop taking it since it's making things worse and retest in 6 months. And if I stop taking it, is it possible my T4 will go back up or did I just screw myself over with this medicine?

Also, I have been dealing with this for nearly 5 years. I had a TSH of 6 in early 2016 and then 8 point something a few weeks later. I tried levothyroxine then but after several months it made me hyper so I stopped. TSH was normal when tested in Sept 2017, then showed up high again in July. Last result was the lowest my T4 has ever been and I feel tired all the time."
29,Update! I shared earlier that my 8 year old daughter got a referral for precocious puberty and it was confirmed yesterday. She is a 2 on the Tanner scale and will be starting her period within the year without treatment. Which means second/third grade. Any thoughts or ideas on Lupron shots?,"They did blood work yesterday and also did an X-ray or her wrist and we will go back in two weeks. Both her pediatrician and endocrinologist both recommend treatment. My daughter is fully aware of what is happening and she wants treatment and hopefully it will buy us at least a couple of years.

On my maternal side of the family many of us including me struggle with hormone issues so I have always had that in the back of my head. She is 4’2 now and I honestly worry she will be super petite like my mom 4’11 or niece that is 4’10 1/2. 

Many of us have pcos and I struggled with fertility issues. She is my ivf baby because of that.

Does anyone know of any peer reviewed research I can read or any info I can educate myself more about this?

I don’t know what the side effects of the Lupron would be even though I took it during fertility treatments and it wasn’t my favorite. Apparently she will be taking more of a XR?

Any anecdotal stories, advice or tips would be so appreciated!

Also my son is 4. He has always been in the 100th percentile for height and weight. Should I also keep an eye on him as he gets older?

33,"PTH High, Calcium High - OK Hyperparathyroidism But Wait, There's More - Nodes, Urinary/Kidneys and Hematuria","I am in the process of being diagnosed for a primary dis-ease which can be any number of varieties, one of them is primary (?) hyperparathyroidism based on a PTH of 125, Calcium 10.1, Vitamin D deficiency. But 3 10-13mm enlarged lymph nodes were found on the jugulars and another artery - they were ranked as being a 1. Then there is microscopic hematuria - all tests including CT/US/MRU/ urology was performed, Phleboliths  were seen on the CT. Other than this no pathologies.  I understand that some calculi is microscopic and extremely difficult to see, but along with the hematuria I've had non-stop Leuks as well as casts. Nephrology wasn't fazed, Creatinine is high - within bounds as is Urea. CBC is normal. Gyno sees fibroids. Constant pain as if UTI - all tests aside from a few - negative. No nitrites or e-coli. Cystitis was mentioned once, but the pelvic pain is more akin to PID.  Is this one syndrome, and if it is, what would be its name?"

36,Sudden decrease of TSH and with slight decrease in FT4 in hashimoto patient,"Hi all,

The public healthcare in my country is pretty crowded, doctors overworked, and it will be a couple of months before I can afford a doctor who will have the time to look at my data properly.

I'm 35, male, and been on levothyroxine since I was 20. Diagnosed as hashimoto's because I have off the charts Anti TPO - but no increase in Antithyroglobulin.

I was basically on 125 mcg of levo since my check up in 2016. April this year I decided to take this disease seriously and went for another check-up, my TSH was around 5.72 ulU/ml (upper limit is 4.20) but a FT4 of 1.36 ng/dL (lab's ok range is 0.93 - 1.71). Doctor basically said that your TSH is high but FT4 is good so keep at your dose.

So that's what I did. I had been on that dose for 2 years already.

Got checked this month again (5 months later). To my surprise, my TSH is 0.1885 (lab's lower range is 0.35) and my FT4 is 1.27. This is the first time in my life that I have my TSH below 4.5 and it just shot through the bottom range it seems.

The only thing I changed is: For the last 2 months, I've been on a low FODMAP diet because I have gastrointestinal issues (frequent diarrhea). This means no fructans, fructose, lactose, mannitol and sorbitol. Is helped with my excessive gas and regularity but even though I'm strict with the diet, I still have random surprise diarrhea. I also lost 9kg (around 20lbs) in the process, weight I didn't want to lose because I'm not overweight. Now I feel underweight. I have never lost weight this fast in my life. Maybe I'm at a caloric deficit, but I eat lots of rice, vegetables, fruit, the diet is strict with no processed food etc.

Anyways, since my hashimoto's diagnosis 15 years ago I always had hyperthyroid symptoms and not hypo. I can't figure out why that is. Frequent diarrhea, unable to keep weight (hard to gain weight), anxiety, too much perspiration for my liking, oily skin, scalp etc. I just can't figure out why that is. Even in 2016 when my disease was terribly managed (with a TSH of 20 and FT4 of 0.9 - that's when I was pushed from 50 mcg of levo to 125mcg) I always had hyper symptoms and not hypo. I said this to lots of doctors but they never could explain how I was basically a hypo patient with all the symptoms of a hyper person.

The dagger through all is, they checked my Hb A1C and it's 5.9! They say I'm pre-diabetes! I can't see how it is possible. I don't eat junk food. I don't even consume added sugar. Not even in my tea. I don't drink soda. I don't drink alcohol. I don't have visceral fat. I eat home cooked healthy meals. I don't eat out. I'm not overweight. I've never been overweight. I sleep 8 hours a day. My only sin is I'm pretty sedentary (I'm a computer programmer who works from home - will change this ASAP) but does this make sense?

Unless I'm type 1 (how likely at 35 years of age? I have 2 autoimmune diseases already), why would I have pre-diabetes? Why would my Hb A1C be on the upper limit? I don't understand. No one explains to me. Doctor almost mocked by saying ""I'd say drop some weight, but I see that you don't have much to lose""

Why would my TSH suddenly drop with FT4 barely budging (and in a fine range)? No one explains to me. Why do I suffer with hyperthyroidism symptoms all my life when I am a hypothyroidism patient? No one explains. I feel like something else is wrong with me but no one cares to pursue it.

Do you think my situation makes sense? Do you have any pointers for me?"
37,New here. Looking for guidance.,"I (28F) have been overly concerned about my hormones since I was ~5 months postpartum, which was 9 months ago. I haven't seen a doctor yet, because I 1) don't have a GP and 2) I'm worried what they'll say. I hope I'm in the right subreddit, but if not, please redirect.

TL;DR at the end.



When I was pregnant, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and it was devastating. I was put on a strict diet only, no meds were prescribed. My iron levels were also low so I was taking a slow-release iron supplements at the time. My baby is as normal as can be and I'm thankful for that. However, I've been going down an emotional spiral (was never diagnosed with depression/anxiety but these emotions have intensified 5mosPP), I sometimes feel my heart beat out of my chest when I'm sitting (but I've always had a normal resting heart rate of 60-70bpm), my memory retention has gotten worse, I get brain fog (I'm currently taking online classes and frequently find myself misspelling every other word and switching letters which is something I've never experienced so frequently before), I get very irritable (it's causing my husband stress, I feel so bad about it), and when I wake up in the mornings my feet always hurt when I stand up first thing in the mornings (not sure if this is anything but worth mentioning).

5 months postpartum I was losing hair. A LOT came out onto my hairbrush. I told my mom (who's an RN) about my hair loss and heart palpitations. She said it may be because of my thyroid and recommend I go see my doctor. Well, I unfortunately don't have one and I know I should. Since I don't have a GP, how will I be referred to a specialist? Who should I consult with to figure out what's going on with my body? Should I see a psychiatrist for my depressive/anxious/irritable episodes or is this a hormone related issue? (I would ask my mom these questions, but that is a personal issue in itself that I don't want her to get involved in.)



TL;DR my body is different. I think my hormones are imbalanced. Or maybe I'm still struggling with an undiagnosed PPD/PPA? I don't have a General Practitioner. Who should I see about it? Please give me guidance. Thank you."

39,Can I ask my endo to help me conduct a series of independent clinical trials based on lifestyle changes?,"I have a rather unique, if complex, situation   concerning medication induced persistent low t years after discontinuing medicating. I have made ALL doctor recommended lifestyle changes to encourage recovery to no avail. I changed my diet, sleep routine, stress response, exercise. No dice. 

I've been offered three differing medicative prognosis for the same diagnosis (tertiary hypogonadism) and I've decided to follow their other offered route of ""wait and see."" However, I've come across a few practices with some clinical research but mostly are anecdotal that i would like to try. The caveat: they work only in the short term and results vary by individual. The only way to know if they are helping me personally would be to run daily or weekly labs for a period of time. I'm already committed to documenting my strict, consistent recommended routine as to rule out variables. 

If i provided what research there is on these practices, could an endo justify the frequent testing?

PS - I'm not looking for suggestions on exogenous treatment. I have IRL doctors for that. If you know of a food, a lifestyle change, a good habit or protocol that you think i may benefit from - tell me. Any research notes you can link to would be appreciated."

46,Help with Hashimotos - is this more serious?,"  

Hi, I got labs done last week and my doc said I'm border line hyper. I think I most definitely am b/c I was STARVING every 45 minutes and eating constantly. I ended up gaining 5 lbs and I just wasn’t feeling good about myself. My lab results were: 

TSH: 0.19 (.45-4.5) 

T4: 1.3 (0.82-1.77) 

T3: 3.3 (2-4.4) 

Before labs were taken, I was taking 88mcg of Tirosint at 10pm. I also took 5mcg of liothyronine at 6:30am and 2.5mcg at 1pm. Due to hyper symptoms, doc suggested I drop to 2.5mcg of liothyronine in the morning and afternoon. I dropped the dose a week ago and have been experiencing excruciating muscle pain. I’m also very tired and mentally foggy and depressed. 

Is this normal? How long should I give this a test run? I really have no idea what to do. Is this more than Hashimoto’s? Is this pituitary or blood sugar related?

So. 
Ive been so heavily depressed, crushingly so, and its only today I have had a BURST of joy. Within moments I practically collapsed into myself, my chest too. My upper abdomen.

Since 6m after my OD I assumed these effects were hepatological, but after this, I see all of those pain locations, those weak areas all in this one bodily array. Ny endocrine system.

Do they fix or am I just going to weaken until I collapse and die? Doctors are fed up of me, if I can heal i will just play the patience game. Love, love yourself."
54,"29M Born without Thyroid, Pituitary, and Hypothalamus","Hi, I’ve got a couple questions, but first let me try and give a brief background about me. I was supposedly born without a thyroid, pituitary, and hypothalamus, and my right optic nerve is really small. The reason my drs think I was born without those, is because on the MRIs I had done as a child, they couldn’t find those parts. I’ve been on thyroid meds my whole life, and I’ve been obese all my life. I started puberty early, then was given shots to delay it, and then when it was time, I was put on testosterone to continue it, but to this day I am pretty sure I have not finished going through puberty.  I am still on testosterone injections, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 10-15 years ago, I have adrenal insufficiency, and high blood pressure. About 6 years ago I had emergency spinal surgery due to Cauda Equina Syndrome, was in the hospital and rehabilitation for about a month learning how to walk and take care of myself again. I still need help to do daily activities, so I live with my mom and sister, and they help me. 

So now that I gave a background, I have a couple questions. I see my current endocrinologist every 3 months, I talk to him for maybe 10-15 minutes, he has somebody draw blood, and then calls me a couple days later with results. Is this normal? 

I’ve been having muscle pain and tightness, so I brought that up to him, I also asked him about the results of a ct scan I had done in the er, it said I have a cirrhotic appearing liver, so he had an ammonia blood test done as well. The results for the muscle test were extremely high, and he said that is probably because I had the testosterone injection the day before. So I went back in a week to do it again, it was lower, but still incredibly high, and the ammonia result was in range, but on the high end. I was worried, so I messaged him, and he said the high CPK is usually seen after muscle damage, it can be caused by some cholesterol meds, which I’m not on, or inflammatory diseases of the muscles, we’ll retest when I see you in November, and this was the beginning of August. Should I still be concerned, or let it go until November?

Even though I see my endocrinologist every three months, should I still have my yearly physical? I haven’t had one in 15+ years. 

Finally, with all the info above, I’m thinking about looking for a new endocrinologist, but it’s so hard to find good ones. What should I look for, besides making sure they take my insurance?"

59,Can coffee cause adrenal adenomas and hyperaldosteronism,"6 years ago in my late-20s I discovered I had primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) after being admitted to the emergency room with severe headache and high BP (200/140).   After a year of all the tests we confirmed the right gland had an adenoma, as well as the venal sampling, the fatty shoulders, multiple urine and blood tests, multiple BP drug trials.   They called me a textbook case of Conn's syndrome and supposedly they wrote a paper on it.   The adrenal gland was removed and I recovered (not before the intern cut open the vein taking out the tools and almost killed me but that's another story).   Thank you SFGH.

Anyway, my endocrinologist and therapist tell me not to dwell on it because it's over and I am healthy as can be (""back to normal"") and that there is little known what causes it.  My primary care doctor who didn't know me then, always takes note to say I am healthy now and treating me as a new patient with followup tests hasn't seen anything out of the ordinary for some time.   But still I am always very curious about this when I revisit the memories, what are the prevailing theories about what causes the adenoma to form nowadays.  Could I have stopped it? Did I cause it?

My thoughts leading up to the discovery....

All throughout my 20s I was 50-60 lbs overweight for my height, no smoking and little alcohol, and I was a heavy coffee drinker.  In the 2 years leading up to this, I was in grad school and completely stressed out and drinking 4-6 cups a day. But I was drinking it throughout the day, constantly on caffeine.   

\- Did washing my body in coffee all hours of the day mixed with other induced stress hormones preempt the adrenal gland to continuously output aldosterone? 

\- Could an adenoma actually be an adaptation by the body?   If the human was continuously hunted, wouldn't it favor a body that could cope with the constant stress? 

It is a rare disease and yet I had it so it makes me wonder if it is not really rare or how I could help others stop it.

65,Is it possible to have hormonal imbalance which is not visible in the blood test?,"Hello! I am 26-27 right now. When i was a teenager i had a little acne but it was normal to light. I was never concerned about it cause i know its was normal for my age.

And after that i had clear skin. In my 21 i started having a little acne which i never even gave attention at first. I was never obssessed with having totally clear face and some pipples did not bothered me. Really slow i started developing serious acne which i really did not even realised at first cause i did not had pipples but mainly it was sebum under my skin which made my face look really rough and  weird. People started asking me what do i have and my face is like this  some people were so confused they were telling me is this acne it looks so weird. And finally i also started developing some painful cystic acne. But it was a combination of a rough texture with some cysts.  Well i when to a doctor which destroyed my face with a cream for acne which made me burn serious in the sun. I still have serious damaged skin but this is another story.

So after this disaster with this doctor i went to an endocrinologist with an hormon blood test she told me that my problem is not in hormons and to try not touch my face maybe (which i never do or did). So i tried to find a natural solution cause except from having extremely damaged from sun skin i still had extremely serious acne and i tried evening primrose oil. Which helped me SO MUCH! My SEVERE acne disappeared. And its for sure the magic solution when i run out of it or i have stopped it for some months in order to not get used to it my severe acne comes back really fast.

I really wish i have tried it from the start i would have saved my skin. But the think now is that even if i am keeping taking the evening primrose oil as supplement which also helped me with PCOS i observed at first that last months i have serious back pain when i have my period! Its so strong also i NEVER in my whole life had back pain NEVER. Also now i observed that my breast is in pain and i feel the right breast really hard in touch and also maybe like its a hard lymp inside it but i am not totally sure. Also from last month i observe that i have a little acne which i am not used to have when i take the supplement.

Is it possible to have hormonal imbalance which is  not visible in the blood test?

Cause from my story with acne i totally believe my problem was for sure hormonal.

My periods though are not heavy i have normal blood flow and its stable. I have period every 22-24 days and i rarely even never have any delay."
66,Questions about Paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and Procardia XL,"Long story short, I don't know how to use reddit well. Posted about this over the past few weeks. More info in those posts. Uncontrollable symptomatic HBP had me in the ER. Doctor there wants to look for this type of tumor. I have lots of questions. Everything has the same limited info. I'm switching to that doc for primary and see him later in the week.

The doc put me on Procardia xl 30mg. Started it Wednesday. Dropped diastolic down pretty fast, and made me feel awful. Felt better the last two days. Started feeling crummy Friday night. It doesn't seem to be working anymore and symptoms are back. Especially eye pain, floaters, and blurry vision. Some confusion and fogginess when I'm physically active. Highest recorded today was around 150/100 at rest. Very little change to heartrate, but I believe that's expected. It runs 90-140 and drops into the 70s during sleep with brief large spikes (150-200) every hour or so.


Is this result typical for Procardia? He said the meds might not control the BP well if the tumor is the cause. Do I need to give the meds more time? Is there a point where I need to go to the ER vs wait for doctor's advice on Monday? I guess I had a bit of false hope with how great I felt with the normal BP. 

I also have other questions. I want to narrow down my questions for the doc at the first appointment if possible. Lots of them to do with these tumors. So any help with that would be great too."
67,Question on a possible malpractice suit against an endocrinologist,"So I recently added DHEA to my supplement regimen and it’s literally like a magic pill and pulled me out of a slow suicidal spiral. 

My symptoms were adrenal fatigue type stuff. I know that’s not an official diagnosis but I had a general feeling of burnout and stress disorder. Sleep schedule was all over the place. Bad brain fog and ADHD. Uncontrollable anger and mood swings. Sleeping 9 hrs a day and still only functional for 3-4 waking hours. Bags under eyes even with adequate sleep. Taking DHEA has instantly improved all of these symptoms. I’m both ecstatic and fucking pissed that the medical establishment (regular and psychiatric) has missed this. 

Over the last 4-5 years this has afflicted me, tens of thousands of dollars in lost productivity, wages, career growth, emotional distress, lost romantic opportunities, etc. Frankly if this continued another year I’d be dead by suicide.

So 3.5 years ago I went to an endocrinologist and expressed these symptoms to him and he took some tests and said I was fine and should get more sleep, even tho I told him I was getting 7-9 hrs. I went and looked back at the tests and he didn’t test for DHEA levels or ACTH which stimulates DHEA output. Furthermore, low ACTH is part of adrenal insufficiency which is an official diagnosis I may have. I need to get that checked. But all I know is taking DHEA has been a game changer. A life changer. When he told me I was fine (based on thyroid and cortisol and testosterone readings) I knew I wasn’t fine. I KNEW there was something not right with my health. And I’ve known this whole time, 3.5 years. With DHEA my sunken eyes instantly cleared. My anger instantly went away. My energy and productivity instantly went up. I felt I could provide for myself. 

Anyway, is this a negligence or failure to diagnose malpractice?"
68,"is there any optimal values for cortisol, acth, epinephrine, norepinehrine?","basically I used to be adrenaline, stress junkie? if I can call it that way? random situation would my heart beat, would feel bursts of adrenaline cortisol, basically easily excitable, while enjoying it....BUT! 
after I was injected with betamethasone dipropionate (30x potent corticosteroid long acting) that I didn't know what it was or was explained or told it's a synthetic hormone cortisol, I literally feel no stress. my heart barely beats when I have stress and I don't feel it basically. I measured my cortisol and it is about 300 in the morning and ACTH is about 40-45 even more than a year after the injection (that i heard is in body for 3 months plus) 
my problem is I never measured my cortisol because I didnt needed it before and now I feel like no energy at all....are there any optimal values? I mean, I know for fact that I had high cortisol adrenaline output before off the charts just by comparing how my body behaved back then and now....."

70,Question on Hyponatremia," A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in one's blood falls below 135 mEq/L.  Can someone tell me how many milligrams of sodium it would take to raise blood sodium level by 1 mEq/L for a 66 Kg male?  

I need to take a NaCl supplement for hyponatremia.  I recognize that the volume of water ingested per day plays a big role in determining serum sodium, but still, some supplemental sodium would be helpful.  I will be using 1 Gm salt tablets as a supplement.  I need to determine how many tablets per day would be a reasonable dose.

72,Looking for opinion on total hormone panel,"Hi all,

I'll really try to make a long story short - I'm a 28 year old male and I believe that I have been suffering from symptoms of some sort of pituitary issue for most of my life, albeit not a seriously debilitating one. I'm otherwise healthy, and have no major genetic/hereditary health issues. I don't believe that anyone in my family has any history of endocrine issues, and my only real guess about how I may have ended up with a problem is that I was in elementary school I was put on Paxil (for absolutely no reason, I think I was afraid of thunderstorms or something) and then Prozac, which I was taken off of when I entered High School and have never taken any other medication again.

Sometime in my late teens/early 20s I realized that I was quite exhausted most of the time, I was physically not as fit as I should have been given my lifestyle and more importantly I didn't feel as though I was in my early 20s, I have always felt this sort of lethargy that I can only describe as burnt out. The only other indication is that I have had gynecomastia since puberty, I would place it between mild and moderate. My bloodwork has been consistent over the last ten years, all of my values are in range aside from my hormones. The results below are from about 1 month ago:

TSH - 1.550 uIU/ml | 0.450 - 4.500

Thyroxine (T4) - 5.5 ug/dl | 4.5 - 12.0

T3 Uptake 28 % | 24 - 39

Free Thyroxine Index - 1.5 | 1.2 - 4.9

LH 4.2 mIU/mL | 1.7 - 8.6 

FSH 1.6 mIU/mL | 1.5 - 12.4

**Testosterone, Serum 261 ng/dL | 264 - 916  \*\*Low**

Free Testosterone (Direct) 12.6 pg/mL | 9.3 - 26.5

**Dihydrotestosterone 27 ng/dL | 30 - 85 \*\* Low**

**DHEA-Sulfate 546.0 ug/dL | 138.5 - 475.2 \*\*High**

Estradiol 13.7 pg/mL | 7.6 - 42.6

Insulin 9.3 uIU/mL | 2.6 - 24.9 

Sex Horm Binding Glob, Serum 19.3 nmol/L | 16.5 - 55.9

Prolactin 10.9 ng/mL | 4.0 - 15.2

&#x200B;

While these are the latest results, these are almost identical as they have been for the last 10 years. Of course, I have not had readings of all of these every time, but overall I have had each of these tested at least 3 times in the last few years and the only two that change even slightly are total testosterone by +/- 20 and TSH very slightly. My question - do these results look like the results of an otherwise healthy young male who just so happens to have slightly lower testosterone readings naturally for whatever reason, or are there other readings in here that indicate there is something else wrong and that perhaps I could be feeling a lot better than I actually am? I am not hunting for hormone replacement therapy, miracle supplements, or anything like that - I am perfectly ok with being told that I have a standard deviation from the norm in a few hormones and that this is not the cause of my symptoms. Any insight, recommendations, opinions, or suggestions are welcome.

Thank you for your time."

I am 22 years old, my weight is 63 kg, height 163 cm and I'm from Romania. I wanted to know if it normal to have the level of total testosterone of 11.58 nmol/L (333.99 ng/dL) at my age. The free testosterone is 13.04 pg/mL. 

I want to mention that during this period I come back after a rather severe depression. And in the last few years I had some depressions for somewhat trivial reason. I have the cholesterol increased to 250.3 mg / dL and I have gained weight. This time I was helped out of depression by antipsychotic (Zyprexa) and antidepressant (Cipralex) medication. When I started taking this medication my weight was 50 kg and now I'm 63. My libido is almost non-existent and my boobs started to grow a little.

I don't know if my depression caused the low T or the low T caused my depression."
79,"High cortisol, confused.. please help","26 yo male, 5 foot 9, 185lbs 

Blood tests came back 3 months ago with a cortisol level of 580 (not sure what this number is seems everyone else is using two figure numbers, I’m from the UK if that matters)

Retest last week results came back at a level of 697, doctor is saying these levels are not down to stress and something is causing them? 

Been ‘urgent refereed’ to see a specialist, however the first available appointment is 75 days from now! 

Been doing some research and I’m really confused as to what could be causing this. 

Past symptoms:
-aching arms/legs (was low in vitamin d/folic acid started to supplement and this has resolved)
-drug induced anxiety (panic attack from MDMA binge, seems under control now though don’t even feel stressed) 

Current symptoms:
-feel like I bruise easily but could just be overthinking that
-weird floaty feeling in my head CONSTANT for 3 months, started after a 2 day alcohol binge 
-had some problems with erections, however I think it was performance anxiety, erections more frequent now and viagra has me erect all night. Morning erections are nearly none existent though. 

I don’t really do any weight lifting. 


I feel like I don’t have the typical Cushing symptoms, I’ve actually lost 20lbs this year through diet and exercise, not fatigued; I played football + cycle after a physically demanding job, no nausea/cramps. Got fat around the abdomen, I am overweight but I have always thought my stomach and ‘love handles’ are a bit excessive for my size. 

Initially I thought I had an ammonia build up on the brain which would explain the weird feeling in my head after the alcohol binge, however my liver has come back as perfect so doesn’t really seem plausible now. My thyroids are showing up fine on tests too, cortisol the only thing elevated.

If anyone has any suggestions on what’s up with me I’d be thankful as the urgent referral kinda made me nervous and now having to wait until October isn’t great. 

Thanks"

If any of you are interested, feel free to try it.","I'm a radiation oncologist, so I obviously get many questions about all aspects of cancer. I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. This includes various endocrine conditions. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical or personal information to us or any other party.

To be clear, the app is **strictly educational** and all information contained within **cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician**. It is aimed at the general public, to clarify exactly what causes cancer and give some idea which risk factors have a larger or smaller impact.

The app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of a condition on the risk of cancer or would like to calculate your own risks, please feel free to try it.

83,Can anyone help me decode some of this test results?,"I got injured about a year ago which severely impacted my ability to move. I was unable to walk for 3 months, and then only able to walk with crutches and then a cane, and now I'm able to walk unassisted but I've lost lots of muscle due to atrophy, and I've been working out doing physio, bike, etc, but my strength is still low and progress is slow and my recovery from any training is very slow. My muscles get so sore and tight that at the end of the day I can barely get to bed. My Doctor gave me a testosterone test and it came back really high, and he asked if I was on steroids?! So, he recommended getting my hormones checked and I finally saw an Endo, and got some results. Can anyone make sense of this for me? I've got an appointment in 3 months? but I'd like to get an idea of what might be going on in my body. My physiotherapist said I should be recovering and getting stronger much faster then I am.

Diet is clean, all organic, no drugs or alcohol. I get adequate protein, eat my veggies, take Omega 3s, low sugar, etc.

I have symptoms of Low test, and do have more of a pear shape with excess fat on stomach and thighs, low libido, very little body hair, etc Except I do get erections pretty easily....I'd mention that I do intermittent fasting, and don't eat any junk food, and follow all the rules...I was actually looking good a few years ago but I've always been a really hard gainer and find it very hard to put on muscle.

90,Massively elevated SHBG?,"Hello, recently had some bloods done and I’m finding the results very confounding.

Am 28, female, had an obstetrically uneventful pregnancy a couple of years ago. I do have rheumatoid arthritis that had been dormant for a decade and returned rather volcanically a few months post partum, and had meningitis shortly afterwards, but we are going back a couple of years now. At the moment, joints behaving reasonably well and I am in reasonably good health. Iron and vitamin D could probably do with a boost but at last testing were definitely in the decent zone.

Follicle stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone both came back as ideal for my age. Estradiol and testosterone both normal too - the former was juuust into the lower third of normal, the latter the upper third.

But my sex hormone binding globulin came back as 149 nmol/L! I am baffled because from what I can detect, for a reasonably healthy young woman who is not underweight, not on the pill, has always got pregnant very quickly and has regular periods etc this is astronomically high. Am hoping to seek medical evaluation IRL soon, but is this something anyone can shed any light on? Possibly also worth mentioning that I have a slightly sluggish thyroid with antibodies present, eat a very normal diet, and I have suspected endometriosis (endo has not yet been diagnosed officially and the symptoms are reasonably moderate)."
91,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis, looking for information on low dose naltrexone and vitex interactions","Ive been researching vitex or chasteberry to balance my hormones. (pms and lack of libido) 
in my searches i found the following:
> "" It is thought that chaste tree berry contains dopaminergic compounds (related to dopamine, a neurotransmitter) (Wuttke et al., 2003)"" and "" One study found that vitex binds to opiate receptors, which may explain its ability to relieve PMS discomforts and pain (Webster et al., 2006)."" LDNScience has the following on their website: ""Naltrexone is an externally administered drug that binds to opioid receptors. In doing so, it displaces the endorphins which were previously bound to the receptors. Specifically, by binding to the OGF receptors, it displaces the body’s naturally produced OGF. As a consequence of this displacement, the affected cells become deficient in OGF and three things happen:
1.Receptor production is increased, in order to try to capture more OGF.
2.Receptor sensitivity is increased, also to try to capture more OGF.
3.Production of OGF is increased, in order to compensate for the perceived shortage of OGF. (...) what results is a rebound effect; in which both the production and utilization of OGF is greatly increased. Once the LDN has been metabolized, the elevated endorphins produced as a result of the rebound effect can now interact with the more-sensitive and more-plentiful receptors and assist in regulating cell growth and immunity.""

Am I right in assuming these two should not be taken together as they target the same receptors?
Is it possible to take the LDN at night and the vitex the next morning or would that diminish the working of the rebound effect of the LDN?
Thank you for reading."

My Dr told me on the visit in which they did the blood test that I should stop taking them (this was only 1 week ago) and still did the blood test which resulted in high testosterone (DHEA causes both testosterone and estrogen to elevate and I was operating under the assumption they were low based on previous blood tests).

At 9 I was diagnosed with Hypopituitarism, Hypothyroidism, and Adrenal Insufficiency.  I take thyroid (Armour Thyroid) and cortisone for this.

At 15 I was put on estrogen to start my periods and development but had such an extreme reaction to the drugs that I had to stop it.  The periods were super painful and my breasts leaked as if I were nursing.  I also have fibromyalgia and a billion other issues as well, but the fibromyalgia is the cause of my chemical sensitivity to many prescription drugs.  So I stopped the estrogen after several months.

So basically I've been menopausal my whole life. I don't get my periods. I don't have underarm or pubic hair, and I never fully developed except for my breasts.  And because I haven't taken estrogen and other hormones besides the thyroid, I do have severe osteoporosis now. 

The past few years I've been having hot flashes off and on, but the last 4-5 months it has been awful.  I'm 44, which is about the age my mom went through her menopause.  Is it possible that I guess my body produced enough that I'm now going through an actual menopause?  I look at all the symptoms of it and it fits me to a T.  I just didn't think I could go through that since I never had it to begin with.

It is miserable. I don't know how women handle this! It's bad enough I already live in Florida with our wretched heat and humidity, but my God, these hot flashes are killing me. I had to take a Benadryl at 5am this morning just to get me sleepy enough to try and fall asleep, because no matter what I did, I couldn't get cool enough. I have the AC going, a fan on, an air purifier blowing, drinking ice cold drinks, and my body will literally be cool to the touch and I even start sneezing when I get a chill, but at the same time, I'm sweating and feel like I'm dying.  It's miserable.

So can this still happen? I wish I had the money to get bloodwork and all done, but unfortunately I can't afford a doctor right now.  I just wanted to know if this was at all possible."
106,Reasons for high morning acth other than addison's?,"My morning acth is 110 (normal range <46), but my morning cortisol was 8.5 (5.0-25). So I know I don't have addison's, because of the cortisol and my electrolytes and blood pressure are also fine, but I also have a plethora of symptoms such as constant palpitations, fatigue, and joint pain. Could there be any reasons for this? I also have slightly elevated glucose (102)."
107,Long term treatment of Central Precocious Puberty,"Hey everyone, 

&#x200B;

First time posting re medical advice on Reddit so apologies if I don't know terms/say something wrong. 

&#x200B;

I'm 28, F, who was diagnosed (eventually) with CPP after first presenting at the age of 6. I'm incredibly lucky in a lot of ways, and the main legacies that I'm dealing with here are short stature (which I actually have grown to love); suspected PCOS; slight hypertension (not bad enough to warrant drugs, bad enough to stress me out and skew the results); and weight gain (which due to an unrelated muscular issue I would probably have had to a certain extent anyway). I originally lived in England and was treated incredibly well by the team at Great Ormond Street, then moved to Ireland and went to Crumlin Childrens Hospital, where honestly the care was of an entirely different standard and I \*hated\* my consultant. 

&#x200B;

Here is my question - what experience(s) have others had in terms of the long term treatment and supervision? When I was younger and in the midst of it, we were told I would have to be under quite strict and regular medical supervision - yearly appointments with blood tests, physical checks, ultrasounds, bone scans etc. Is this still the case? Since I was 18 and discharged from the care of the paediatric endocrine unit, I have had to fight tooth and nail to get attention from a series of consultants who knew nothing about CPP and in many cases refused to see past the weight issue, even when told there was a hormonal cause to it. I haven't had an ultrasound in years, or a bone scan, and honestly I am this close to giving up on it altogether, except for a sense of guilt that \*maybe\* if I keep going I am not tempting fate and my records might eventually help someone else? But that seems like a ridiculous reason to keep making demands on an already over-stretched health system.

&#x200B;

TLDR - what is the current thinking on PCC diagnosis and the level of treatment required over time?"

110,GnRh Agonist & Estradiol Addback HRT - I need some brains on this,"Can a blood test show the use of a GnRH agonist (at a ""pseudo-menopausal"" dose) when a woman is simultaneously using HRT estradiol at a dose that proximates her mid-cycle range (so 550-1650 pmol/L)?

I'm talking LH, FSH, hCG, etc serum markers....can any blood test be used to show her concurrent use of a GnRH analogue (nafarelin)? Or would it be as though she hasn't used one? This would be at the end of a course of 3-4 months."
111,Which hormone follows this daily pattern?,Are there any hormones which start to rise in levels about the same time as cortisol but continue to rise until peaking at noon? They may also or may not dip in the early afternoon and then peak again (although not as much as at noon) around 5 then go down until the next morning. I’m assuming it’s an excitatory hormone like NE or EPI due to the cyrcadian-like rythym in which it follows.

116,"(25, M) I think prolactinoma may have caused puberty arrest. Would a return of normal GH and testosterone to my system cause my face and body to mature?","(I've already made an appointment to go see my doctor and begin the process of getting evaluated/tested.)

I display many symptoms of potential prolactinoma including galactorrhea, gynecomastia, loss of sense of smell in late teens, gynoid fat distribution with cellulite.  Symptoms that line up with prolactinoma started in my teens and I didn't seek treatment as it happened *just* slowly enough and in *just* the right way that it was able to be missed for quite some time.

I am frequently mistaken for a 16 year old even when I grow what little facial hair I have.  In terms of pubertal hair development, I was stuck at Tanner Stage 4 for a while (and aside from pubic region and armpits almost entirely hairless at 18) and only in my 20s have I slowly slipped into Stage 5 (with slowly spreading hair appearing on my chest, legs, arms, face).  Only these past 2 years has hair developed on my inner thighs, neck, and jaw.  And very sparsely, at that.  While I do know that men become hairier as they age, I feel like this sort of a change is peculiar and delayed.

From what I can gather, it sounds like a case of prolactinoma, likely with resulting hormone deficiencies (GH, TSH, testosterone, etc.)  Based on what I’ve read, teenagers with arrested puberty due to prolactinomas generally spontaneously resume puberty on their own when the prolactinoma itself is treated, though some need hormone therapy.  But I'm 25, I don't know if it'd work the same for me or not.

My lower jaw is very weak and childlike in particular, and my teeth in my lower jaw don't quite have enough space and are sort of bunched together/pushing against eachother slightly which wasn't the case when I was younger.  I also have a somewhat childlike nose, and my cheekbones were essentially nonexistent even when I was thin.  My voice also has a 'teenage' quality to it; despite not being high pitched it just doesn't sound adult-like.  My hands are thin/small and have been described as very feminine.  I essentially have the *opposite* features of someone with acromegaly.

Though it could just be the way I'm shaped, given my other symptoms I think it's at least somewhat possible I have a pituitary hormone deficiency and that that may have impacted my development.

What I can't figure out are:

* If I do have prolactinoma — Is there a chance puberty would start off where it stopped when I'm treated, even though I'm 25?
* Would a normal 26 year old's hormones result in development in these areas I'm potentially lacking, or would I need *teenage* levels to see changes in bone structure in my face/hands?
* If I never got the hormones I needed to develop in this sense and my levels don't reach pubertal levels, would an endocrinologist potentially give me a 'boost' for a time before tapering off to average levels for my age range?

Thanks!"
117,Is FSH of 2 concerning for a male of 27?,I have a right testes that moves around freely (bell clapper) and a very small left one. I use Propecia (about 1.2 mg per day) for hair loss. FSH came in at 2 IU/L. E2 is 121 pmol/L. Total T is 18.9 nmol/L. Free T is 452 pmol/L. SHBG is 26 mol/L.

I do have facial and body hair, although its thin and lacks thickness mostly seen in fully grown males.  My pubic hair has a normal distribution (deemed to be tanner stage 5 by several urologists).  My testicles are normal size and shape for a male my age.  I have checked for klinefelter's - both karyotype and sperm count were normal.  What I did find was that my testosterone was in the low normal range - low enough to where I decided to go on TRT therapy.  Can anyone help?"
119,I'd really appreciate help,"Hey guys,   
I'm a 29 year old male and took just ONE DOSE of 0,25mg Finasteride 3 days ago. My body had a severe reaction to it and I'm absolutely helpless and I'm just trying to find someone to help since I don't know what to do at all.

I got pre-fin bloodtests on the same day I took fin. Took it at around 13 o clock, felt really good. Was out socializing and came back home at around 18 o clock. Was looking at some hot pictures and got an instant boner as usual. An hour later fapped with no problems. The weird thing is my penis stayed errect for WAY longer than usual after ejaculating. It was weird but I didnt care. Tried again around 22 o clock and just couldnt get it up AT ALL, like not even 10% errect. 

At the same night I had then extreme heartrace(never experienced heartrace even in stressful stiuations prior..) while just laying in my bed for several hours and insomnia. The next day my head felt like hit by a brick. Had extreme dry mouth and very frequent urination. Was in the gym (hoped to get maybe test up..) and had like 0 salviaproduction. 

The next night I couldn't sleep for longer than 1-2 hours at a time, never had problems to sleep through a night before. Yesterday I took 3mg of melantolin and slept probably for 7-8hours, but still waking up every 2 hours and falling fast back asleep. My headache is way less then the day before but still appearent. I feel like puking after eating anything and experience weird intervals of no hunger, hunger -> eating -> feeling like I need to puke.

I don't care about most of these symptoms, but I still have 0 connection to my bottom side and it's freaking me out. It's been 3 days, it says online serum dht suppresion can happen to 5-9 days. But from my understanding the dht suppression of 0,25mg is not that big of a deal anyway and I fear I'm damaged for life. I've never had any errection problems prior and could get it up after nomatter what. And now I can't even get 10% errect lying in my bed for 30min trying.

Some symptoms got better, frequent urination stopped, dry mouth got way better. Head hurts but not THAT much anymore. Libido got like 20% back and makes me even more appearent that bottom side has no reaction to it..

I'm totally desperate and willing to pay for any help. I live in Poland but do speak German aswell (if this matters, been raised there). I'm willing even to travel anywhere.

I fear if I don't do anything the chances for recovery might be less and less. Please I want kids and a familiy and this is just not something I can cope with and I don't know where to go with this from here."
120,Can I have high DHEA but low pregnenolone??,"I have very treatment resistant anxiety and depression and have tried almost anything.

121,Can high IGF-1 lead to rapid increased appetite/rapid weight gain?,"I am a 19 year old male diagnosed with hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and delayed growth. Currently taking 44 mg testosterone/week and until recently 3 mg growth hormone/day. Until a year ago, I had been quite lean and skinny my entire life. 

Anyway, over the last four months I have grown 1 inch and gained 37 pounds. I am now 5’6”, 162. Some is muscle, but a lot is definitely fat. Recent lab work showed IGF-1 at 817 ng/dL which is supraphysiological. Additionally, fasting glucose and triglycerides were a bit high. 

I have reduced the growth hormone down to 2mg/day at the advice of my endocrinologist and have started trying to lose weight and control blood sugar. Obviously one cannot gain so much weight without overeating, but I did not intentionally change my diet during this time. Can high IGF-1 lead to such weight gain and metabolic issues? Is cutting growth hormone to 2mg the appropriate response?"

123,Pamorelin,"Hi! I need help with something.

I'm a trans woman, and I got a hormone blood test done three months ago. My testosterone levels were in male levels. After the blood test, I was prescribed Androcur and Estradot. I started Androcur at 100 mg every day, then my doctor told me to go down to 50 mg after about 2 months. A new test was made and my testosterone levels were normal for a woman. Now, three months since starting Androcur and Estradot, I got prescribed Pamorelin 11 mg, a nurse injected it today in a muscle. And every three months from now I have to get a new Pamorelin injection.

My question is: In the paper that comes with the Pamorelin, it says that testosterone increases for 2-4 weeks after an injection, to then completely stop producing. Since I was taking Androcur for 3 months before my injection of Pamorelin today, does that affect the 2-4 week flare? Does it not flare in my case since my testosterone levels were already in female levels? Or does it flare, and I need to take Androcur every day for 4 weeks?"

125,CAH/PCOS?,"I was diagnosed with CAH as a child and took hydrocortisone from about age 8-14 to regulate my hormones.  Not long after I went off the hydrocortisone, I was prescribed hormonal birth control as a means to control my teenage acne.  I took some form of the pill for 23 years, until I was 37.  

Last August, I decided to stop taking the pill.  My husband and I are comfortable using condoms for birth control purposes, and I wanted to see what my body was like without synthetic hormones.   This April (almost exactly six months later), in a routine exam, my gynecologist discovered a growth on one of my ovaries, which was so large (17 cm x 17 cm) that it had to be surgically removed.  It turned out to be a benign cyst, thank goodness.  Leading up to the surgery, I had many, many blood tests, which confirmed my childhood CAH diagnosis and consequently showed elevated testosterone levels.

Now my gynecologist wants me to go back on hormonal birth control to prevent future cysts from growing or getting so large.  She thinks I may have PCOS (my limited understanding is that not much is actually known about the cause of that).  I wonder, however, if the cyst could have been the result of some sort of hormonal surge as a result of going off the pill after so many years- and, if so, whether my hormones might regulate themselves given time and I won’t be at risk of growing any more large cysts.  It took five months after going off the pill for my periods to regain a regular cycle, so I see that as an indication that my adrenal system is just now starting to behave “normally” again.  

I would like to wait a couple more months post-surgery (the cyst was removed two weeks ago) and have more blood tests done before I resign myself to being on the pill for the rest of my pre-menopausal life, but my gynecologist is concerned that cysts could form in that time and put me in danger.  

Anyone here have any thoughts?"
126,"Cystic acne for 20 years, hormonal panel shows elevated IGF-1","info: male, 38 yo, bmi normal

long story short:

been dealing with resistant to treatment cystic acne on head, face, chest, neck, back, oily skin (entire head area), severe symmetrical joint pain (wakes me up at night) - been on two accutane courses during those years and every other possible treatment. The only thing that looks to be wrong in my hormonal panel is elevated IGF-1 (30-40% high comparing to my age group).

&#x200B;

Please note that I don't eat dairy (appending to some sources it can elevate IGF-1) and the test was done during my dairy-free diet which started years ago. Dairy increases my cystic acne heavily.

&#x200B;

My doctor ordered OGTT test to rule out acromegaly it came back fine. Appending to some sources animal protein restriction can cause IGF-1 levels to drop. For the past two weeks I have not been eating any animal protein and most of my cystic acne decreased in size significantly it is also far less painful.

&#x200B;

My question is what can be the reason of elevated IGF-1 levels in my case (since OGTT test ruled out acromegaly (?))? Also can I avoid animal protein forever (I am afraid this can end badly due to B12 deficiency etc.)?"

This is accompanied by a **4.023 mUI/l TSH** level.

All of the doctors seem to dismiss these results, just because I am not overweight. I am not overweight because I fight against it, and believe me, it's not that easy. With this dismissal, all I can do is wonder why the levels are so high.

I don't drink coffee, apart from the occasional espresso. Haven't had a drink in years. I am not stressed. I sleep well. I exercise. Eat well. What the hell is making me have these high levels? How can I lower them? I've tried everything.

132,Worried about hair loss - how valuable are my lab results?,"When I last visited my dermatologist he decided that he wanted to get my hormones checked because of my chronic acne and hair on the upper lip and neck (I’m 24, f). It is not too strong and can be easily removed but still to be sure we sent my blood to the lab.

At home I started obsessing badly about PCOS and all that comes with it. After researching a lot, I suddenly had the impression that my usually quite thick hair got thinner somehow and lesser on the edges. I‘m not sure if it‘s just my hypochondria speaking and it‘s just a non-voluminous phase of my hair or if there is actually a problem (alopecia, PCOS etc.)

So the lab results from earlier came back and my derm told me that everything is fine and that it‘s unlikely that I have either hirsutism nor PCOS. I haven‘t had the chance to ask him about the hair „problem“. Yesterday I got the bill from the insurance with the listed hormones. They checked (sorry for the formatting and probably german names): 17-Hydroxyprogesterone, DHEA-S, FSH, HPL, Progesterone, SHBG, TSH, Androstendion, Estradiol, HCG, LH, Testosterone 
The values of all of them are apparently normal for a 24 yrs old girl.

My question is: Does this also say something about my hair loss/thinning on the scalp? If all of the above tested hormons for hirsutism are fine, is it likely that I have some sort of „untreatable“ alopecia or more likely just because of a stressfull phase with the chance of it growing back to the original strength?

I hope this is the right place to post and sorry for the bad English. Of course I will get it checked if it‘s getting too bad. But any sort of insight is very appreciated."

142,Screenwriter requires assistance regarding medically accurate pituitary disorders,"I am an independent screenwriter involved in the development of a science fiction script. The team is very focused on ensuring we have medically accurate information in the script as it is central to the plot.

The story details a type of futuristic thalamic implant that looks like a small tumour (eg Rathke's Cyst) under MRI scans. The protagonist has had this implant inserted against his will - but he can not convince anyone to perform surgery or even put a endoscope into his brain to see the implant because he does not display the symptoms associated any pituitary disorder.

My question relates to what symptoms can be faked (or induced) such that an endocrinologist would recommend endoscopic approach (getting a camera into the base of the brain to record evidence of this implant) or removal of the lesion/tumor?

143,Unquenchable thirst!,"So i visited my doctor because i could not stop drinking water and cant stop urinating. No matter how much i drink i have this maddening dry taste in my mouth. Its become very distracting because i exaust quickly on the soccer field and i cant sit down for an hour and a half lecture without getting up to pee 4 seperate times. The doctor sent me to a lab to get blood work done for both diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. All of my values were normal. In addition this creates dreadful breath to the point where im too embarrased to talk to anyone. The doctor referred me to an endocrinologist but im afraid he'll send me to get lab work done i cant afford. Does anyone have any theories or suspicions? Before you say diet, i consume a decent amount of sodium but nothing that drinking literally 12-15 bottles of water a day shouldnt be able to balance"
144,Hyperthyroidism?,"I am not looking for a diagnosis, just advice thoughts or suggestions!

My wife has had thin hair and has been super thin her entire life, huge apetite. 

She has also suffered throat problems, very frequently, sometimes twice a month or more (sore throat, sometimes sharp pains,visible tonsil stones sometimes)

Her periods are also excrutiatingly painfull, crying through the night painful.

She also complains that her lymph nodes are swollen and there is a lump in her throat (more recent) although the lymph node under her chin is usually always swollen, she says.

She is very warm frequently and also suffers from recently diagnosed OCD and anxiety that as we look back has been a problem since she was a kid.

So we feel like there is some immune system problem/ thyroid problem?

I feel like whatever is going on is starting with some hormone problem. Any combination of these trigger some thoughts? Let me know!

&#x200B;

Her mom is super natural with medicine which is why none of her problems have been addressed or looked into which kinda makes me mad at the inlaws but whatever. I just want to help my wife stop suffering."

149,Effect of Hyperthyroidism on serum B12,"I've been trying to figure out what the relationship is between hyperthyroidism and B12 serum levels.  Reading papers, I can only get that they are lower, but does that mean B12 levels are made lower by being hyperthyroid?  Or is it something else, like not eating as much, or some other factor?  I know that my numbers personally go down, but I may have a contributing factor.  Also, does being hyperthyroid skew the serum test, and another should be done such as the MMA?  Thank you so much."
150,Insulin and the ketogenic diet,"Endocrinologist of Reddit, 

People on a ketogenic diet try to limit levels of insulin because it contributes to fat storage. That makes me wonder. The human body is a really efficient machine and does not like wasting resources like insulin for nothing. If I were to be on a diet that provides me with just the amount of calories I need for my metabolism and consume a cheese sandwich for lunch, why would my body produce more insulin than the amount it needs to convert the excess glucose in my blood stream to glycogen? It just seems wasteful to me that fat storage is ""just an effect that occurs when insuline rises"". What am I to make of this insulin scare? "

152,Changing levothyroxine dose after hyperthyroid incident (effective change of dosage?),"Hi there, so this has happened 2x now, unknown reason possibly nicotine which I gave up.  But my TSH went down to about .2 or a bit lower, then we dropped my Tirosint down by a step, first 150mcg to 137mcg every day.  New doc second time, 137 and 125 alternating.  She wanted my TSH to be lower than a 1.2 (which is where it was after round 1 and before then) so I guess my question is this... After 6 weeks the draw at 2pm was a .788 with a FT4 of 1.72.  3 week draw was .633 FT4 1.57.  (similar time of day) .  I'd like to stay around where I'm at.  Is this likely?  I'm not sure how split dosing on my way up works, or if it will help with that.  Also, it's supposed to be an average but would the 2 different days feel different?  It seemed like it, but who knows.  

Thanks! I appreciate it.  It's hard, even getting an appointment is out into July, I have to wait until next week when they can get me on the calendar, I guess."
153,Synthyroid,"Hi, I went to a thyroid doctor because I was having depression/anxiety problems. It was assumed I had thyroid issues because both my mother and grandmother had them as well. Because of this I was put on 50mg of synthyroid a day. This is all fine and dandy, but I’m trying to get into the military. I cannot get into the military unless there’s no sign that I’ve had depression/anxiety. My question is what would be the chances of me getting taken off this medication so there wouldn’t be a chance of me getting rejected by the military? I haven’t had any depression or anxiety in a very long time and I feel like it was situational and they rushed into putting me on this medicine. They say I have hypo but there wasn’t even evidence from my bloodwork saying I had much of an issue. What do you all think? "

*skin problems, including redness, facial hair growth, slow healing, dryness and acne
muscle weakness
* unexplained high blood pressure
* unexplained high blood glucose (sugar) levels
* extreme changes in mood, including depression and anxiety
*irregular periods 
*abnormal hair growth on face

162,"Seeking research participants, 15 min survey and chance to win a gift card!","Hello! My name is Nicole Antoniadis, and I am a graduate student at Pacific University in Hillsboro, Oregon, USA. I am currently completing my dissertation on the effect of coping strategies on anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia (which is the omission or manipulation of insulin doses for the purpose of weight loss). This study aims to identify specific styles of coping which prove to be effective at decreasing the impact of anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia. These co-occurring problems can make recovery intensely difficult, so identifying more effective coping styles may lead to more successful treatment strategies.

The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to finish and it is voluntary and anonymous. There are no risks for participating in this study. You must be 18 or older, have type 1 diabetes, and have a history or current experience with diabulimia in order to participate.

163,Does methylprednisolone cause breast growth?,"I'm 24F. About two months ago I was prescribed an M-Dose pack for sinus issues. The second day I was taking it, my boobs started hurting really badly, so I stopped taking it (so I took 24 mg total on one day). Since then, one breast has been growing every day, but the other has not. Prior to this, I never had breast pain or swelling, not even before my period. I also never get cramps or other PMS symptoms, and the next two cycles after taking the methylprednisolone, I had terrible cramps all the way in my thighs. I am also a small person (4'11 and 80 lbs), so I have a feeling that medications maybe have a bigger effect on me than on larger people. My breasts have been the same size for as long as I can remember before this. All the women in my immediate family have really small breasts, so I don't think it's a late growth spurt due to genetics. 

I went to a gynecologist about it and she said it's probably not related to the methylprednisolone. She said it might be due to some other hormonal change, or it may be cysts. I have an ultrasound in a week, but I'm getting freaked out because the asymmetry is getting more and more uncomfortable, and I'm a small person so I do not want large breasts. I've heard of breast growth in your twenties, but I've never heard of one breast growing and hurting literally every day for several months. Is this a hormone imbalance? If so, is there something I can do to stop the growth? Is there a possibility it will shrink back down? "

I think thats all of them. 

I have yet to be diagnosed with anything other than hypoglycemia, with varying readings coming from bayer meter and libre (which I’ve found for me isn’t too accurate with lows, but it seems to be an issue?)

I’ve been through a lot of testing and I’m perplexed.

A1c is always below normal limits at around 3.9. However I don’t think I’m having that many dips in the day to cause this number? My endo and I theorized that maybe it’s when I’m sleeping, since a couple years ago I’ve started getting up in my sleep and drunkenly (that’s what it feels like) walking to the kitchen to eat junk. We also theorized maybe reactive hypoglycemia since I have dysautonomia. Now I think she was theorizing hypokalemic periodic paralysis, but I don’t know now after the mixed meal study results. My sugar doesn’t run very high, and at the mix meal study only hit 133, the 3hr glucose tolerance though it went over 200.

So here’s everything, if anyone has any clue

A1c-low

Fructosamine-normal!

Showing a little anemic with iron and transferrin borderline low and TIBC borderline high.

No imaging yet.

Mixed meal study

Baseline was normal and fasting 12hrs

Then:

Insulin -high at 106, 25 is upper normal

C peptide-high at 5.8, 3.9 is upper normal

Glucose again only shot to about 122.

These results repeated through the 3 hours

&#x200B;

My last result at 4 hours my glucose had dropped about 30-40 points in 1hr to 78

And the c peptide and insulin were normal.

In the middle of the test my potassium dropped to a little under low normal and shot to mid range before returning to a little above the low normal.

ACTH and cortisol were fine.

We are waiting on glucagon and steroid test results.

Anyone have these issues with low a1C, hypos, and high insulin and c peptide response??

The only thing I am coming up with is insulinoma. "

173,Finding an endocrinologist who uses bio-identical testosterone for FTM transitioning,"My son is transgender (FTM) and would like to start testosterone soon.

My son already has dealt with severe depression that we have just gotten under control, and anxiety which we haven't.  He attempted suicide at 13, and been hospitalized under suicide watch 6 times.  Many studies show that bio-identical hormones do not carry these same risks for disease and mental health problems, because they are identical to the hormones in the human body. Is it possible to transition using bio-identical testosterone? Is it possible to find an endocrinologist who uses bio-identical testosterone?  If it is how would we go about finding an endocrinologist who uses bio-identical testosterone?   I'm not looking to start a flame war debating the merits of bio-identical vs. synthetic hormones.

I know there are exogenous peptides available out there such as Clinuvel’s Afamelanotide (Scenesse) which I’ve read has the potential to be a huge game-changer for its DNA repair, anti-aging, anti-cancer, neuro-protective benefits etc etc but I’m wondering if there are any ‘bio-hacks’ out there that maybe as simple as eating a certain way, a supplement or some other lifestyle modification...

&#x200B;

I've also been dealing with a molluscum infection since September 2018, though it finally appears to be subsiding. In general, have noticed symptoms of less energy and thinning hair, but I'd mostly chalked that up to ""just getting older.""

177,Lost secondary sex characteristics with onset of menopause,"56F here. About 4 years ago I developed chronic widespread tendon pain, brain fog, exhaustion and weight gain. This occurred within a couple years of the onset of menopause and was a sudden onset.  I have a history of anxiety and depression but was doing well prior to menopause, around which time my anxiety shot through the roof for no apparent reason. I can’t say that coincided exactly with menopause which is such a gradual process. 

My tentative diagnosis for the chronic pain and malaise is lupus yet I am negative on every test except low C3/C4, and no treatments for lupus have helped.  Not even prednisone. I stopped the prednisone a very long time ago.  

Both parents had hypothyroidism but my TSH and T4 are normal. 

I recently saw an Integrative Medicine specialist who suggested the cause of my symptoms could be hormonal. I should point out that my weight gain in 4 years is 25 pounds, most of that in the first year. All my pubic and armpit hair fell out, as well as eyebrows. I no longer have B. O.  and do not need to use antiperspirant. I have no libido. This is despite being on HRT: Prempro 0.625 mg, plus Estring low dose vaginal ring for vaginal atrophy and urinary incontinence. I have developed an abdominal body fat pattern. 

A couple months ago I started DHEA and my pubic hair is growing back but still no libido, BO, or eyebrows. 

My PCP thinks I am on the proper level of HRT but I still don’t feel like myself.  She didn’t think I needed to see an endocrinologist. 

But do I need to see one? And what could be going on with me?

Signed,

(Please refer to the image of my graph that I made below) I have been dealing with this for the past almost 11 months now, and I don't know how much longer I can deal with this for, so any possible pointers as to what this is or how to fix it would be appreciated. (Nothing like ""oh maybe he's not right for you...""- like actual medical answers please) But it all started when I was in the most amazing long distance relationship for two months prior to this, I was insanely infatuated with him, and it was the most exciting thing ever. But on the other hand, I was getting very little sleep, and under a lot of stress. Which is what may have triggered it. Plus, my hormones were going crazy from this new excitement, I assume. But then one day at the end of March, a few days before I started my period, I suddenly lost feelings for him. I assumed it was just my period, and I thought I was right, because a few days later I felt strongly for him again (yet not as strongly as I did before it dropped- and haven't nearly felt the same way since). But the for the past almost 11 months, it seems to have the same pattern- the way I feel towards my boyfriend drops significantly right before my period begins, then after about 5 days I start to feel strongly for him again, and then about 5 days later, right between my periods, or perhaps during ovulation, the way I feel for my boyfriend and how attractive I find him drops drastically, lasts for 5 days, and then rises again for another 5 days, and drops right before my period starts. I hate feeling so negative about my boyfriend, as it is when it goes down, and I really want to find out what this is so I can put an end to it. It is honestly torture when it drops, and when it rises again I wish it were to stay that way, but it never does. But when it is low I don't want to look at pictures of my boyfriend, and I can't even imagine us together in person, and I constantly get negative thoughts about him or the way he looks, and every little thing will bother me about him when it is low. I had to break up with him because of this, because it is torture. I am wondering if this is a hormonal imbalance? Is this an estrogen imbalance? A progesterone deficiency? Oxytocin imbalance? Some kind of mental imbalance? Is this even related to hormones or my cycle? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!!

180,Nicotine affect on thyroid? TSH lowering after a week of quitting... can it reverse itself?,"Hello, I quit smoking a week ago after what was a short stint of smoking that drove my TSH down from a usual 1.4 to .6,   So in a month, 3 weeks of smoking and then a week of being quit, my TSH seems to keep going down and a now its a .37..  I'm wondering if there is just a time period that I have to wait after quitting that it should reverse itself?  I thought that it might correct itself but maybe I'm not being patient enough.  I'm waiting on FT4 and FT3, but for now I'm just hoping I don't go hyperthyroid again.  I had vaped before, and went hyperthyroid, so for whatever reason maybe I have an issue with nicotine.  Thank you for any help you can give, and I know my question might not be spot on, but I can answer any questions.  Thank you!"
181,Long Term Safety of Melatonin ?,"32 year old male here, with a height of 6 foot(180cm) and weighing at 180lb(82kg).

I have had a history of having difficulty in falling asleep and was suggested to try melatonin. I have been using it for nearly 6 months now on a regular basis. Recently I did a little bit of searching online and it seems like the long term safety of melatonin is unknown. Some research papers claim its an antioxidant and what not but I am more concerned about its safety and was wondering if anyone from the medical community could provide an unbiased opinion on melatonin

Highly appreciate it any feedback here. Many thanks in advance.

182,Hypothyroid symptoms after running marathon,"From the time i was 13 i have always been the same weight. 135- 142 pounds. No matter what i ate or didn’t eat, how fit or unfit i was i was always in that range.

When i was 24 i decided to run my first full marathon. I felt healthy and great for the majority of my training. I was in the best shape of my life. 

Midway through my training i stopped taking birth control pills and lost my period until 3 months after the marathon. I hadn’t lost any weight so i assumed everything was ok.

At the time i was following a lower calorie meal plan in attempt to tone myself a bit more. Looking back i realize i probably should have been eating more for the amount i was burning.

After completing my race i gained 20 pounds within the month. Still eating healthy and training 5-6 times a week. I was constantly fatigued, had brain fog, and the driest skin possible.  within another month i gained another 10 pounds. 

I saw a doctor and was put on unithyroid for ‘minor hypothyroidism”. When that didn’t yield any results i was told to start on the pill again to fix any hormonal imbalances.

It's been 3 years since and i have not been able to lose any weight. I’m not in an unhealthy range but i'm heavier than i would like to be. My TSH has gone from slightly high to super low (.03 at one point). I never regained the energy i once had. My doctor still keeps me on the unithyroid.

Does anyone have any idea what happened?"
183,Found a lesion on my adrenal gland....totally confused..,"47 year old female here. Was in great health. Then started to have zero energy. Noticed my lower legs below my knees to my ankles were swollen and red. And at the end of the day dead tired felt like my mucles in my lower legs were literally trying to separate from all things that they attatch to. And my skin literally hurt. Almost like someone had kept rubbing in the same spot for hours! Sore as hell. Couldn't massage the pain away infact any kind of pressure hurt.

I decided to go see my G.P. but where i'm from it's all nurse practitioners who work at a clinic under one doctor. Anyways my nurse practitioner is a tree hugging,retreat taking,bring back new cumbia type of medicine. I find her to be a straight fruit cake. 

I go see her about my rapid weight gain due to no changes in diet as well as swelling of legs. And zero energy She wanted me to see a nutritionist and why don't i try chewing a raisin mindfully. Chew it at least 20x's. Think where did it come from. Notice the taste. Make a fucking production out of eating a raisin. Super out there. I think she thought i was there cause i feel fat. I don't even know. She wasn't even listening to my symptoms.

I actually went to her cause i was feeling so shitty and exhausted. I needed a referal to get a cat scan. I had remembered about 20 years ago at an emergency appendix surgery they had done a scan and found this adrenal lesion. They told me then to follow up. But i had small kids and life moved so fast i never thought about it untill now. 

I went on line and from what i read about my symptoms it pointed to an adrenal issue. Then i rembered about the 20 years ago adrenal lesion. All the things i read pointed to that might be the problem. I went to see my doctor. 

She reluctantly gave the order. Guess what came back the adrenal lesion. But when i went back for follow up i asked for a diffrent  N.P.  i really  am feeling like shit. 

The new N.P orders bood work. Gets it back says all looks good. But from what i've read that can happen. I asked to see an endocrinologist. I needed answers. 

I got the referal waited 2 months saw him yesterday and he was great. He was very attentive to my issues. He looked up my test and said he didnt think this lesion was a big thing but to be on the safe side cause he never assumed anything. He also ordered test more thorough tests that the "" normal  standard test "" don't pick up. 

He promised he would help me find answers as to why i feel so bad. He had said alot of doctors miss diagnose anything to do with the adrenal glands and he doesn't want to miss anything. 

I can't wait to feel normal again. I'm sick of when i wake up feeling like i hasn't slept. And all this pain my body is feeling. I ckearly have a hormonal thing going on. I need to know what this is and fix it. I can't stand having no answers and feeling like shit. Plese let this be a step in the right direction.

Im 27 years old and my blood serum results show always dhea def since years . 

The result from yesterday showed that i have dhea-s 206 (280-680). Every result was in that low area .

Months ago a few redditors told me to reduce stress and not to take dhea cuz it will increase naturally. Im honest i have no stress at all jobwise or unhealthy food habits or whatever . Everythinf is ok.

Only thing is i have depression since over 10 years and i suppose obsessive negative thinking increased my stress levels so much till dhea got less and less. Now i dont have ocd anymore

&#x200B;

I tested my thyroid thoroughly the first time 2016, I was 25 then. It's in german but summarized it says that there are no antibodies against the thyroid and fT4 is 10.6 pmol/l. I already then wondered if there is something strange going on with the low thyroxine but the doctors assured that everything is fine. Well another three wasted years went on..

I have a lot of different symptoms, I'm in  psychiatric treatment since childhool with depression, anxiety, add-like symptoms (sluggishness, forgetfulness,brainfog) etc. I have got a lot of different body-symptoms also. I let my thyroid test again last week and my **TSH was 1.58 and my ft4 10.2**. I'm just wondering if it was possible that there could be an relationship between all the symptoms and my thyroid or pituitary?

If I compare my TSH to the values of this article [https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/98/7/2936/2537137](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/98/7/2936/2537137) then are mine suspiciously low. According to the equation my TSH should be higher -> median is  about 4.8 (with this low fT4)...

193,Exercise while hyperthyroid,"33 yo F, history of papillary thyroid cancer with a total thyroidectomy in 2007, on maintenance levothyroxine. Normally pretty active (bike 5x/wk, swim 2-3x/wk, pilates or yoga 1x/wk) and am otherwise healthy with no other medical problems.

Last week my TSH was low (0.018, with a normal T4) and I’d been feeling jittery, so we decreased levothyroxine and will recheck TSH in 6 weeks. 

My endocrinologist recommended I “take it easy [on exercise] for a few weeks until the TSH normalizes.” So I’ve taken the past week off of all exercise (except walking) and I’m wondering how and when it will be OK for me to start again, since the recommendation he gave was pretty vague.

I had very low (undetectable) TSH in the past (years ago), and this is the first time I’ve been told not to exercise. I understand that the risk would be arrhythmia or (more chronically) heart failure, but I’m also a bit confused bc even if the TSH takes weeks to normalize, my level of thyroid hormone should immediately adjust (since I have no thyroid tissue left, the only hormone is what I take in the pill). I can’t tell if my endo is just being conservative, or if I really need to not work out for 4-6 wks(!!!!).

- Has your endocrinologist recommended exercise precautions for medication-caused hyperthyroidism?

- If so, did they give specific guidance on what kind of exercise is OK/not OK? (yoga vs cardio vs strength training...) And/or how long exercise should be limited?

Obviously I am going to ask my doc for clarification, but was curious to hear if others had similar experiences.

Thanks!

My background is psychology and philosophy so I’ll apologise if this comes off as a stupid question."

196,Can the body produce estrogen directly without aromatase?,"Can the body, or a tumor, produce estradiol, or estrone, directly without using the aromatase enzyme pathway? Everything I've read says that the only way to make estradiol is via aromatase:

1. Androstenedione is converted to estrone by aromatase, and then estrone is converted to estradiol via 17β-HSD.
2. Testosterone is converted directly to estradiol by aromatase.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol#/media/File:Steroidogenesis.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol#/media/File:Steroidogenesis.svg)

&#x200B;

My body is producing way too much estradiol and I don't know why. My labs from last week showed an estradiol level of 118 pg/mL, a testosterone level of 190 ng/dL, and a LH level of 6.5 mIU/mL. Previous labs from 2011 showed an estradiol level of 34 pg/mL, a testosterone level of 179 ng/dL, and a LH level of 5.7 mIU/mL. This is a 347% increase in estradiol level.

&#x200B;

Since my previous estradiol level was normal that pretty much rules out Aromatase Excess Syndrome because I don't think acquired AES is possible. I've check all my medications for possible interactions with aromatase or estrogen and can't find anything. The only thing that appears to be left on the table still is an estrogen secreting tumor.

&#x200B;

However, that doesn't appear to add up ether, because if aromatase is responsible for the biosynthesis of all estrogens then it would seem to make reasonable sense to presume that my testosterone level would also be elevated in relation to the first and second set of lab tests. Because:

1. Androstenediol is converted via 3β-HSD to testosterone, and then testosterone is converted via aromatase to estradiol.
2. Androstenedione is converted via aromatase to estrone and then estrone is converted via 17β-HSD to estradiol.
3. Androstenedione is converted via 17β-HSD to testosterone, and then testosterone is converted via aromatase to estradiol.

In all three of those chemical conversions it takes less steps to create testosterone then it does estradiol, thus therefor there should be more testosterone. However, the TT/E2 ratio for the two sets of lab tests is 1.6 and 5.26 respectively, this is a 327% change.

&#x200B;

All of the excess estradiol only seems to make sense if there is a tumor that has a mutated copy of the aromatase CYP19 gene that is operating in AES mode. Another theory is that aromatase is being unregulated. What regulates aromatase?"
197,Estrogen/Progesterone statistics?,"I'm just curious, what are the average amounts of estrogen and progesterone in:

198,Does a prolactin level of 127.0 ng/mL warrant an MRI/treatment?,"42 years old.  5'7'' - 185 to 190.  I know I'm fat, I'm down from 199 and lift 3 times a week.  Still working on this.

&#x200B;

I noticed about nine months ago that I was starting to have issues with my lifting, weight loss stalled and some ED.  Basically my strength was just gone and I felt like a black and white copy of myself.  So I went and had a testosterone test done which came back with:

&#x200B;

Testosterone, Serum	160 Low	ng/dL	264 - 916

&#x200B;

This led me to see a urologist and he ordered some additional blood work.

&#x200B;

LH 1.8 mIU/mL	0.6 - 12.1 mIU/mL

Testosterone 187 ng/dL	180 - 680 ng/dL The bottom range seems really low to me? Different age range?

Prolactin 127.0 ng/mL	2.8 - 15.6 ng/mL

&#x200B;

The number here that really jumps out at me is the prolactin value.  I'm meeting with my urologist again tomorrow for a follow up but was just curious what I should be expecting.  Does a value like this warrant an MRI and referral to an endocrinologist?  Will a urologist prescribe Cabergoline or other dopamine agonist in the interim ?

I spoke with my OBGYN to see if maybe getting on a birth control and skipping the placebo pills could possibly keep me from experiencing this every month. I have been on both pills for a year now and still struggle every few months. It always seems that when I feel the anxiety coming on I end up bleeding for a few days. I am taking YAZ but I was under the impression that when you are on birth control your body doesn’t ovulate so why am I bleeding? Especially if I don’t ever take the placebos and start a new pack the next day? I am very consistent with taking them the same time everyday.

209,Impossible Weight Loss,"Hello all, I apologize in advance. This will be a long one. Also, I created an account just to tell this story and ask these questions, because there's some embarrassing personal stuff in here.

 

So I'll start with my backstory:

# 1888 -

born

&#x200B;

# 1992 -

Migraines since around 4 years of age - that's when my parents first noticed I was always complaining of pain in my head

&#x200B;

# 2003-2010

I first got my period in 2003 and from then on commonly went months at a time with no period

Was not sexually active or on birth control in high school or college

Was in a long term committed relationship with someone else who also had not had sex

We did oral and stuff with hands/toys, but no penetration

Throughout teenage years into young adulthood I was a normal weight - probably about 140 or so? 5'4"" with a curvy build (in other words, big boobs, butt, and hips lol)

&#x200B;

# 2010

After college I went on birth control

Then got married and  became fully sexually active

I still weighed about 140 when we got married - 22 years old at this point

&#x200B;

# 2011

Around 6 months later I got a good job with excellent health coverage so I started seeing neurologists to figure out my migraines

Saw 4 neurologists in total and was prescribed various prescriptions, none of which worked effectively

Started gaining some weight - assumed it was a side effect of some of the medications

Saw 2 nutritionists - no help for the migraines either

Weight stabilized once I stopped taking all meds for the migraines

At this point I probably weighed 150

&#x200B;

Also talked to my GP about depression/anxiety symptoms

Mom has depression and anxiety as well

GP put me on Lexapro but it killed sex drive

Tried a few other things with various results, none great

&#x200B;

# 2012

Went to a psychiatrist because GP was unable to get the meds right for my depression/anxiety

Psychiatrist put me on Welbutrin 300mg

&#x200B;

Welbutrin seemed to help with depression and anxiety but I still had zero sex drive

Didn't want to deal with psychiatrist anymore though

So stayed on the Welbutrin and just lived with the lack of libido

&#x200B;

Slowly gaining weight

Maybe 155/160 at the end of this year

Didn't keep track of it really

&#x200B;

# 2013

Started trying to have a kid

No luck

No other changes to meds or medical stuff

&#x200B;

Still slowly gaining weight

Maybe 160/165 at the end of this year

Still not keeping track

&#x200B;

# 2014

Went to Lake Norman OBGYN because of difficulty conceiviving

Diagnosed with PCOS

Bloodwork showed I was pre-diabetic

Went on Metformin

Still no luck getting pregnant

After a few months I was no longer pre-diabetic though

Went on Clomid

Still no luck getting pregnant

&#x200B;

Still slowly gaining weight

Maybe 165/170 at the end of this year

Still not keeping track

# 2015

Stopped Metformin and Clomid related to getting pregnant

Started adoption process

No other changes to medications or medical history

Daughter was born in August

&#x200B;

Still slowly gaining weight

Maybe 170/175 at the end of this year

Still not keeping track

&#x200B;

# 2016

Sick all the time

Colds, ear infections, sinus infections, bronchitis, norovirus, strep etc

Saw GP and was told this was normal with a new baby

I think that was likely untrue

In 2016 I was sick more often than I was healthy

No changes to medications

&#x200B;

Still slowly gaining weight

Maybe 175/180 at the end of this year

Still not keeping track

&#x200B;

# 2017

Still sick all the time

&#x200B;

# January 

Had my yearly gyno appointment

Weight was 190lbs - this is the first I truly became aware of my high weight

Also had high blood pressure

Immediately went on Weight Watchers

&#x200B;

Lost weight pretty easily for the first few months

Went from 190 to 160 by April

&#x200B;

# May

Started running with C25K

No exercise whatsoever prior to this

&#x200B;

# December

Lowest weight was 143 - hit this in August and then maintained from then on

Basically stalled out - going up and down .5 lb at a time

&#x200B;

# 2018

&#x200B;

# February

Stopped Weight Watchers and started calorie counting

1250 cal/day

No change in weight

&#x200B;

Done with C25K by this point, started running more

3 times a week, 2-3 miles each time

Started having a lot of knee pain in right knee around this time

&#x200B;

# March 

I hired a personal trainer for 6 weeks - met 2-3 times per week and worked out on my own at home 2-3 times as well, mostly running at home

Prior to this I had no gym experience

At the end of 6 weeks, I was 145-150 - so slightly heavier

&#x200B;

# April

Gym opened at work - started having regular classes

I started attending 5 days/week and stopped seeing the personal trainer

Classes are a mixture of HIIT, strength training, weights, cardio, and plyometrics

Continued running 3 times per week - 1 run for a set distance, and 2 for a set time (started at 3 miles for distance and 30 min for time)

Still about 150 lbs

&#x200B;

# May

Knee was still bothering me very consistently

Went to GP who put me on Diclofenac Sodium and sent me to an orthopedic specialist

Ortho said it was PFPS (patello-femoral pain syndrome, aka ""runner's knee"") and that my muscles were imbalanced

So I kept on the Diclofenac and continued working out at the gym

&#x200B;

Also got a new psychiatrist because I was tired of feeling angry all the time

That is the effect the Welbutrin has on me

He took me off the Welbutrin and put me on Cymbalta

This process took over a month in total, but the Cymbalta is a million times better for me

My anxiety and depression are completely managed and my anger is gone

Still zero libido though

Still about 150 lbs

&#x200B;

# June

Still not seeing any weight loss so I tried upping to 1400 cal/day and really focusing on protein

Aimed for 100g protein every day

Still about 150 lbs

&#x200B;

# August

Read about reverse dieting and caloric cycling and whatnot

And felt really burned out from 18 months of strictly monitoring my food

So I took this month off

I let myself eat whatever I wanted, just no ridiculous portions

Weighed 160 at the end of the month

 

# September

Went back on Weight Watchers because it had worked so well for me the year before

Stayed on consistently for 6 weeks then found it difficult to maintain as I still wasn't seeing results

Frustration lead to sloppy eating and tracking

By the middle of December I weighed 168 lbs

&#x200B;

# December

Spoke to psychiatrist about weight issues and he put me on Vyvanse to help with appetite

Went from 168 to 161 in first week - barely ate - probably averaged 850 cal/day

Second week still lacked appetite but probably ate slightly more - somewhere around 1100 call/day

Gained back to 165

&#x200B;

# 2019

# Current status:

I work out at least 6 times a week - that's 5 days of classes and 1 day of long running (currently up to 9.5 miles)

I average 1100 or so cal/day, possibly less because the Vyvanse makes me forget to eat a lot

I still try to focus on getting a lot of protein when I do eat - I eat an RXBar and a protein shake every day

At best, I'm maintaining my weight in the range of 163-168 (which is easily 25lbs overweight)

Honestly, I'd say I'm still overall slowly gaining... just very slowly at this point

&#x200B;

# Currently Taking:

Vitamin D

Zyrtec

Diclofenac Sodium 

Cymbalta

VyVanse

Birth Control Pill - I do the 3-month thing, but honestly I can't/don't keep track of it so I'm probably closer to like 4 months before I take a week off. When I take a week off, I typically have my period for like 6 hours and that's about it. Sometimes I don't have it at all

&#x200B;

# So what's my question then???? 

Well if you read this far, I can't tell you how grateful I am. I'm at such a loss. And I am just looking for insight, answers, support, whatever you can offer.

&#x200B;

I saw my GP again yesterday. This is the 3rd time in the past year I've seen him basically just to tell him how frustrated I am that I can't lose this damn weight. He said that people come to him all the time claiming that they are monitoring their calories and working out like crazy and can't seem to lose any weight. And then he paused and said ""but I actually *believe* you."" Can't tell you how nice that was to hear.

&#x200B;

Since he's kind of out of things to do (my bloodwork has been checked and all appears normal) he is sending me to the endocrinologist. We suspect I may have high cortisol levels or something else metabolic going on. That appointment has not been scheduled yet, but I'm hoping to go soon.

&#x200B;

210,Hormone disbalances?,"Hello guys, please I need some feedback! I havnt ran any cycle, but I feel my hormones are all messed up or some other problem?? Symptoms- feeling nouseus in the morning, i cant eat and want to puke. Hot flashes often, I just feel hot. Tiredness all around even if I sleep 8hours or more. Seems like low estro or some shit? I,m getting bloods done tomorrow also"
211,"Can a person have low (normal) fasting insulin, yet also show abnormally high postprandial insulin after OGTT?","The reason for testing my insulin, is that I experience low blood sugars (around 60 mg/dl) a few hours after a carb load, which causes a strong adrenergic reaction (shaking, sweating, and so forth). This has happened to me ever since I was 11 years old. My fasting insulin was 4.0 uIu/ml, fasting blood sugar 89 mg/dl. In other words, insulin resistance does not seem to be the answer. However, the only explanation I can find regarding the cause of postprandial hypoglycemia, is an excess release of insulin. I am however, confused as to how that can occur without the presence of insulin resistance.  I’m a 26 year old female with a BMI of only 18, have been in good shape all my life. We only tested glucose during my OGTT, which was normal, but I almost fainted about an hour after I walked out of the lab, due to low blood sugar. I wish we’d checked insulin action as well during the OGTT, but my Dr did not see the value in doing so.

Has anyone ever seen or heard of anything like this?"
212,What would you recommend for a woman with low progesterone and estrogen? (Prolactinoma),"Hi everyone! I have a question for alternatives to birth control pills. I’m a young female with a micro prolactinoma and I’ve been on cab almost 4 months to treat it. I’ve lost a ton of hair before diagnosis and Into treatment, diffuse thinning all over. It was found both Prolactin and DHEA-S were high so that may have been why my hair had been slowly thinning and causing a couple episodes of telogeneffluvium over my years in college. Now that Prolactin is low, DHEA-S is down 30% and mid range :) however I’m still losing hair, albeit less shedding than before but you can see my scalp at the back of my head and It’s noticeable and makes me really sad. my endocrinologist was very keen on me taking birth control pills for cycle regulation. But I find when I eat low carb and little sugar my cycle is beautiful and painless. However my obgyn noted i had very low progesterone and low estrogen, and also recommended a BCP to regulate them. The problem is I am not tolerating BC well and part of it might be placebo because I am really against using BCP for anything other than birth control. I am committed to my lifestyle to regulate my cycles. But I want to support my body and perhaps try natural estrogen and progesterone cream instead but I don’t want to mess anything up and my insurance ran out so I can’t be consulting my doctors all the time :/ any suggestions? Thank you in advance. "
213,Take a look.,"All my life i struggled with depression, anxiety, high iratibility, frequent brain fog, many inhibitions due to overthinking insignifiant things(no libido due to that ) and fatigue. The gym life was not good because i had recovery issues and generally had trouble falling asleep or/and poor sleep quality. I ate healthy and worked out regurarly.
Half a hear ago i did a testosterone test and i had 634 ng/dl. 
These days the depresion grew unberable and i decided to visit an endo. I did a set of blood endocrine markers and all came up good (normal) except for CORTISOL. Prolactin is kind of high. What do you think? 
 A few months before the blood tests i let myself go : shitty diet , no exercices ,not going outside,suicidal thoughts.

215,Need to know which tests to order...,"Hi all,

28m, confirmed low T (former doc said I was in the 10th percentile...the bottom 10, three years ago). That said, Hypothyroidism was always suspected in my adolescence, yet never proven. 

I'm struggling to isolate symptoms and focus my search so first, would someone please explain the relation, if any, between the two diseases and second, which tests would I need to order to definitely diagnose this? 

P.S.
I'm uninsured, live alone, and cannot afford health insurance. I've saved for a month to afford these tests. "
216,PCOS or adrenal gland issue?,"So Im (34F) in the process of exploring a PCOS diagnosis with my primary doc. I have many of the symptoms (excess facial hair, stubborn weight gain, painful periods, abnormal cycle, acne, etc), but I have done the blood sugar test and it came back normal. 
Last week, I was in the ER, (I had just had surgery and had some concerning symptoms. Started out feeling like a panic attack but lasted over an hour, I was concerned about blood clots) at which they gave me a CT scan which showed no blood clots, but did show ""an abnormality at the top of my kidney."" 
I do have an appt for tests to see what the abnormality is about, but in the meantime. Ive been doing some research. Turns out adrenal gland malfunction can have many of the same symptoms as PCOS. 
Anyone have some thoughts on this? Maybe it can help me bring some coherent thoughts to my doc appt next week."

220,Any endocrinologists out there?,"I’m a 25 year old female and I have classic CAH. I’ve had a relatively uncomplicated course, until trying to conceive. While I would love to have advice, I’m wondering if there’s guidelines or recommendations on this?

They recently held an inter-department conference, but I don’t follow up with my providers until next week. "
221,Low testosterone but symptoms of high androgens?,"If a woman has low testosterone and symptoms of low energy, depression etc but also low estrogen so she experiences symptoms of high androgens (due to low estrogen to balance it) like acne, hirsutism, male patterns hair thinning; how is this condition treated? 
By increasing T, she experiences increased energy but more virilization, and by increasing E she experiences symptoms of estrogen dominance. Not to mention that estrogen is very difficult to increase without HRT. 
Progesterone further diminishes efficiency of already low E. 
Decreasing SHBG would further cause more free T in contrast to low E and increasing SHBG would bound some of the already low E. 
How in the world would this person get treated? 
And btw this person is me. 
Any advice or insight is highly appreciated 

P.s. many supplements that work with lowering inflammation also in some ways decrease estrogen and many herbs are phytoestrogens which bind to estrogen receptors and disrupt real E form doing its job "
222,Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency question,"Is it possible for someone to have a blood cortisol level in the normal range while on long-term steroid therapy but that they would still suffer adrenal insufficiency if they were to immediately quit? Or would a simple blood cortisol test immediately show that their cortisol is suppressed while on longer-term steroids?


The reason I ask is because I've been on hydrocortisone for a few months, just got a lab test done and my cortisol is in the normal range which means I can simply quit taking the cortisone anytime?"
223,My blood test did not give reference ranges for free testosterone and growth hormone. Please help me figure out if these numbers are low or high.,"I'm a 28 year old man. The results gave reference ranges for some variables but did not clarify if it even took my gender and age into account. For free testosterone it gave me a minimal value and for growth hormone a maximum value, which seems useless because I want to see how I fit on the spectrum.

Total testosterone: 27.2 nmol/l
Reference range: 8.64 - 29

Free testosterone: 0.425 nmol/l
Reference range: >0.125

Albumin: 48.9 g/l
Reference range: 35 - 52

SHBG: 53.9 nmol/l
Reference range: 18.3 - 54.1

Growth hormone (GH, STH): <0.10 ug/l
Reference range: <4.8 **(WTF)**

I emailed the lab but they simply refuse to provide me with reference ranges for free testosterone and growth hormone. They told me I would have to order some ""lifestyle tracker package"" if I wanted their advice on optimizing my levels for only $150...  I just want to know the reference values for someone in my age/gender category, that's it. I honestly don't trust any of their reference ranges which is why I'm coming here for help."
224,Is this low?,"I am seeing online the range for 6-8AM cortisol is between 10-20ug/L.

I got both a 8am and 10am done, for some reason the 8am was unable to be read so I am getting them both redone Monday. However, my 10am was 4ug/L (112nmol/L).

I know cortisol goes down throughout the day, highest being in morning.. But I was wondering if the 10am seems a bit low? I am just unsure if cortisol lowering from 10ug-4ug in 2 hrs would be abnormal(example if my 8AM was 10ug), and because of that I should indeed expect to find a lower than usual morning level with my 8AM retest coming up.

Also.. Is addisons disease anything under the usual levels for 6-8AM cortisol(10ug).. Or do I need to be at a legitimate 0 for cortisol to have addisons disease and otherwise just have adrenal fatigue? I was under the understanding 0 cortisol was death as that was an adrenal crisis..am I right on this? :/

Insight would be valued."
225,Is my SHGB most likely low or high?,"Im a 32 year old female. My estrogen is consistently low, thyroid on the slower end, I am skinny and struggle gaining weight. I have rough skin with big pores and some hair loss that matches male pattern baldness. My body is kinda boyish and if I do gain weight it’s mostly in the mid section. I am getting tested soon, but I’m just curious could my SHBG be high or low according to my symptoms?

170lbs
1000mg Depakot
500mg Keppra at night.


I suffer from juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and my epilepsy focuses around the evening and morning, thus the keppra.  

I have not had a seizure in 4 years. I want to know if going onto HRT would be safe for me. Meaning i wouldnt have any seizures and my medication wouldnt be affected. 

If i could hear back with a detailed response that would be wonderful! I am trying to get multiple opinions prior to bringing it up with my neurologist. "

Thank you. "
229,Should I seek 2nd opinion-pre hypothyroidism,"I'm a 43year old female. My weight has always see sawed, but I've always been able to lose weight when I recommit to diet and exercise. About 4 years ago, I started losing weight and went from 224 to 150. Then last year, I could not lose weight no matter what I tried. I became vigilant about watching everything that went into my mouth and increased my exercise to 15k to 20k steps a day. Nothing worked and I also slowly started gaining weight. 

I've been experiencing high fatigue, cold sensitivity and hair loss as well. 

I finally made an appointment with a GP. My tsh was measured at 2.5. While I understand that this is considered normal,  I've heard there is some debate about it. I  also looked at my prior tsh levels over the years and up through the last test in 2015,  I was always between 0.9 and less than 1.

My GP just says it's normal. 

Should I get a second opinion? If so, does anyone have any advice? 

Thanks!"

A few weeks ago I was about to have sex with a girl, but I could not get an erection. I want to say off the bat that I was drinking heavily that night, so that may have been it. Especially since I hardly ever drink. 

I’m starting to think I have low testosterone. I live a very healthy life. I exercise 6 times a week and am not overweight. I’m almost afraid I exercise too much, as I’ve read overtraining ca cause low T.

The question I have is what kind of doctor do I see to get this blood work done. A urologist or endocrinologist? It seems like they can both help but I’m not sure which one I should go see.

Thanks so much for any help!"
239,sudden loss of fluids and electrolytes. Endocrine?,"Lets try this sub. Repost from r/askdocs

Age: 40, Sex: f, Height: 170cm, Weight: 60kg, Race: European, Location: Europe

Duration of complaint: several years

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): hashimotos, pernicious anemia. Current medications (if any): Levothyroxine, B12 shots. 

Every few weeks I suddenly pee out a lot of fluid and the next morning I'm 600-900gr. lighter than expected and my eyelids look very sunken in. This also always results in constant muscle cramps, pins and needles, very slow heartbeat or palpitations, and sometimes shortness of breath. Plus extreme salt hunger, unstillable thirst and very bad orthostatic hypotension; when shortness of breath is present there are often little bleedings into the skin as well. If such episode coincides with lots of sweating or dehydration then I might end up in hospital with very bad shortness of breath (hence I step on the scale every morning now and don't work out when it happens).

I now know that magnesium, and partly calcium helps against the cramps, potassium against the heart problems and salt against the shortness of breath, at least until the next day. Also salt helps against the thirst.

Bloodtests are usually normal to normal low apart from low magnesium and albumin. But I wonder if the fluid loss is from blood serum and includes electrolytes then the concentration of electrolytes might stay kind of the same, while being too low for some functions. Does this make sense?

Any suggestions on this? Not managed to convince my GP yet to refer to endocrinology.

Now we have a baby (it’s a boy!) and she’s been having discussions with her endocrinologist when to go to radioiodine and how long it is possible to breastfeed before/after radioiodine therapy. What’s your opinion on this? 

1. How long you can wait with radioiodine therapy after surgery? (Her markers are OK)

2. Breastfeeding before/after radioiodine: yes, no, when, why...

243,Macroprolactin and Cabergoline - questions!,"For the last 6 years, I’ve known that I have elevated prolactin levels. Over the years, it’s consistently been measured between 300 and 450 mu/L (the unit used here in the UK - think this is somewhere around 15-22 in the US measurement). This is only slightly above the range, but I have had difficulties with my libido suspected to be the result of this mild elevation.

Last year, my endocrinologist discovered that 47% of this total prolactin was the result of Macroprolactin, which is supposedly not biologically active and therefore not a cause of my problem with libido. He did however start me on a low dose of Cabergoline (I have since tailored this dose down to the smallest possible quantity of the tablet possible - approximately 0.0625mcg; yes, a tiny fraction of the 0.5mcg tablet). This has effectively eradicated my problem with Libido - I now how quite a strong sex drive and relatively few issues. My sleep has also improved. My total prolactin level including any Macroprolactin has been tested at 178 mu/L since starting Cabergoline. This is well within the reference range of <300.

A few questions:

If Macroprolactin is not biologically active, why did I see an improvement in my libido with Cabergoline when my pre-Cabergoline adjusted level of biologically active prolactin was well within range?

What causes Macroprolactin? I can’t find any data on this on the web.


Is it wise to continue on this medication indefinitely? I am taking an incredibly low dose of 0.0625mcg every 3 days or so.

Oh, almost forgot: 27 year old Male.

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism on 12/11/18 and I am feeling super strange on the levothyroxine that an ENT prescribed.  What prompted blood work was feeling sick, swollen glands, muscle weakness.  I even went into early menopause in 2017.  I had a negative mono, so they drew other  labs as well as sent me for a thyroid ultrasound and then a FNA.

245,Nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan?,"Hello,

I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism around October 2018 and started on Methimazole.

Bloodwork the day I was diagnosed:

Triiodothyronine: 318 \[Normal Range: 58-159 ng/dL\]

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH): <0.02 \[Normal Range: 0.32-5.00 uIU/mL\]

Thyroxine: 19.77 \[Normal Range: 4.87-11.72 ug/dL\]

\---------------

I had a thyroid ultrasound around October 2018 - results were fine.

\---------------

My latest bloodwork (done around November 2018, after I had been on methimazole for about 7 weeks):

Free T4: 1.1 ng/dL \[Normal Range: 0.9-1.8\]

Free T3: 2.83 pg/ml \[Normal Range: 1.80-4.60\]

This bloodwork was done when I was on Methimazole 10 mg, twice a day.

\---------------

After the results of the latest bloodwork, my endocrinologist reduced my dosage of Methimazole to 10 mg, once a day.

I am currently on methimazole 10 mg, once a day.

\---------------

General Information:

I am a F in my 20's. I do not smoke. I do not drink. I am not pregnant, I have never been pregnant.

I did take AHCC from like Jan 2018 - Sept 2018, 3000 mg daily, for general immune support.

Symptoms I have had: Trouble breathing, fast heart rate, subtle difficulty with forming more complex sentences, diarrhea for a couple of days, hemorrhoids

\---------------

My endocrinologist would like me to get a nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan.

However, I am just a little anxious over that because I have had a rashlike rash on my right hand since I started methimazole. My hand gets dry and rashlike, on and off. My endo knows of this.

Another thing is I started salivating more than normal, this is on and off as well. I would have to keep swallowing, noticeably. There were a few occasions where I would just be in my bathroom, over my bathroom sink so I can spit out the excess saliva.

I don't know if the dry hands and semi excess saliva would mean I shouldn't get the nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan. The symptoms probably mean nothing, but I haven't gotten a clear answer from my endo yet.

What could be a possible cause behind the rashlike rash on my hand and semi excess salivating? The symptoms I have, the rashlike rash and semi excess salivating, can I still get the thyroid uptake scan with those symptoms?

Also, what would the uptake scan tell my endo that the ultrasound didn't?

Based on my history, how necessary is the nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan?

I’m here today with an issue that has caused me so much stress.  I’m a woman and I have dark hair growing all across  my chest, on my bellybutton, my feet, my thighs, my neck, my upper lip and my chin.  I’ve exhausted all of my options, including


* laser hair removal
* electrolysis
* birth control
* shaving (my whole body, every day)
* plucking
* bleaching
* waxing
* threading
* hair removal creams
* aldactone


and NOTHING has worked.  I’m especially upset about the laser hair removal because not only did it not deliver on a promise of removing my hair, but it made my skin a whole lot more damaged.


I’ve met with my physician, a dermatologist, an endocrinologist and my psychiatrist.  I’ve been tested for polycystic ovaries and high testosterone levels, but this and all the other blood tests came back normal.  I believe this issue is caused by starting antidepressants earlier in my adolescence, which caused a handful of other problems that is not the point of this post.  I’m not on antidepressants anymore but this and other issues have persisted.


I know it is pointless to reach out to the internet but I am desperate.  I know I probably sound annoying or entitled but I have cried so many ugly tears over my body and I will do whatever it takes to make it stop.  I feel broken.  Please, if there is something I haven’t thought about or looked into, let me know.  What else can I do?  Lots of love."

250,Question about hyperthyroid rebound mixed with smoking cessation,"Good afternoon,

I decided to start vaping in July of this year, instead of smoking.  This caused my thyroid to go from a TSH of 1.8 on 30 July to .451 on 06 Sep.  It got even lower, at .177 on the 29th of September.  On the 10th of September I was changed from 150mcg of Tirosint to 137mcg (I'm on it for Lithium).  It became more and more difficult to vape (I'm beginning to hate that word) to the point where I couldn't anymore.  I gave it up on the 10th of October.  I thought I needed to use a patch or something but nothing worked out, and I'm still wondering why, but nothing seemed to work.  Any nicotine related product eventually hurt, but my main questions are this:

On July 30th, I was 1.8 TSH

On Sep 06 I was .451

On Sep 29 I was .177

On the 10th of October I was a .274 (At some point out of curiosity I was using my own money to grab this along with FT4 and T3, but it's just an example, I could give more data points if necessary.  

I mixed and matched smoking cessation devices, including cigarettes.  I finally gave up cold turkey on November 17.

On the 21st of November I was a 2.24 from Labcorp and a 1.7 from the hospital I go to.  I will say these were different times of day and 3 or 4 days apart.  But this is what makes no sense to me:

From the 10th of October to the 21st of November I went up to either a 2.24 or 1.7,

and today it's  1.32.  

What affect would quitting smoking cold turkey have on this, and what affect would just having the hyperthyroid correct itself make the numbers jump so much?  Just a little worrisome to me as quitting smoking is unpleasant (hurts) as it is, I'd rather not shoot back into hyperthyroidism, although I think that's just a fear at the moment.  

I'm waiting to see a great endo, but by wait I mean February.  Sorry if this is all silly.  But as terrible as the process is / was, collecting the datapoints was at least interesting.  

Thank you  so much for your time! Let me know if it doesn't make sense.  Thanks!

251,What's the difference between the impact of glucagon and cortisol on the insulin levels?,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I recently read a book that left me in the open regarding this problem. It was constantly stated that cortisol should be avoided through stress-relieving practices because it eventually creates hyperglycemia and therefore elevates insulin levels, which in turn create fat. 

&#x200B;

There was, however, no mention of glucagon or epinephrine on the same matter. Although they share the same effects of producing hyperglycemia, why is cortisol much more capable of spiking insulin levels than glucagon and adrenaline?

&#x200B;

Does glucagon elevate the blood sugar levels in a constant, more balanced manner whereas cortisol spikes them and insulin has to quickly come into play? 

&#x200B;

Also, why is cortisol blamed to produce fat in the waist area if it has fat-burning effects and where does insulin come into play?

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**1) How is cortisol different from glucagon and adrenaline in regards to spiking insulin levels?**

**2) Does glucagon increase the glycemia at a slower rate, whereas cortisol spikes it and this is followed by an insulin surge?**

**3) Why doesn't adrenaline do the same thing as cortisol? They are both ""fight-or-flight hormones""** 

**4) How does cortisol produce fat in the waist area if it has fat-burning effects?**"

Classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia 17OHP.

0.5 mg Dexamethasone everyday.


I have been on-off Dexamethasone all my life. Without dexa I see my testosterone, blood pressure, ACTH shooting up drastically! 

My testosterone becomes normal with Dexamethasone ALWAYS. 

But my endocrinologist experimented with the dosage and had asked me to stop dexa for about a year, my testosterone, 17OHP and ACTH sky rocketed in values. Then I was put back on 0.5mg dose of dexamethasone, and this helps me keep all my hormones regulated(ACTH, 17 Ohp, testosterone).

I have been experiencing androgenic Apolecia (maybe because of excess of testosterone) since last 8 years and my hair has thinned by half. 

Everyday I live in fear that I might go bald. 


So if I keep take dexa regularly, will my hair fall be under control as dexa brings the testosterone down incredibly (and testosterone and DHT are responsible for hair loss) ?

256,Why don’t I need calcitonin?,"Another “just interested” question from me!

I had a total thyroidectomy for Graves’ disease last year, so I can’t make calcitonin now. Why doesn’t that matter? My calcium levels were perfect immediately post surgery and 6 months later, so I’m assuming it’s not relevant to that.

Does a lack of calcitonin influence bone density? Mine was on the low side when I had active Graves, I’m hoping it will have improved at my next dexa scan."
257,What disorder could I have??,"Hi! I’m here because i’m not quite sure what’s wrong with me. I’m currently seeing an endocrinologist, but I just had an appointment with her recently and we agreed on a course of action for now, so I don’t want to call and freak out and change that. But. I’ll go back to the beginning. 

I’m 18. I’ve been slightly overweight my entire life, never “skinny”, but it wasn’t excessive. I did gain a significant amount of weight randomly when I was maybe 10 or 11, but as I got older I “grew into it” and evened out. I got my period at a normal time (i’m sorry but I truly don’t remember when) but then when I was a sophomore in high school I stopped getting it for about 6 months. I was convinced I had PCOS based on internet searches and made an appointment with a gynecologist, who immediately confirmed that diagnosis based on my symptoms and blood work (no ultrasound). Again, sorry, but I don’t know what she tested that day. Pretty bad acne, mild hair growth on my chin and jawline, missed periods, slightly overweight. She prescribed birth control (microgestin 1/20 i believe) and metformin, which i never took consistently (i know this is bad). 

after 3 months, i was having pretty bad mood swings from the birth control, so my mom called the office and over the phone they switched me from microgestin to cryselle. I took cryselle for about 9 months, and during that time I just gained and gained and gained weight (about 50 pounds). there was no significant lifestyle change—i’ve never had a perfect diet, but i’ve always been aware of carb intake and i never ever drink sugary drinks. i’m not perfect, but i don’t sit around eating cheetos and drinking coke all day, i love vegetables and avoid bread, pasta, etc as much as possible. 

i’ll explain the weight gain through through my dances. at my junior prom, at age 17, in May 2017, i was what seemed to be a normal weight. i think i was maybe 165 pounds and 5’7, but i ran frequently and was seemingly healthy. at homecoming, at age 18, in october 2017, i had gained probably 20 pounds. at my senior prom, at age 18!in may 2018, i was the biggest i’ve ever been, about 211 pounds. i was absolutely disgusted with how i looked, but that’s beside the point. 

i’m now 18 and in college and I’m about 224 pounds. i hate admitting that but there it is. i went to a doctor this past summer and asked to have my thyroid checked. she did, and also checked my testosterone. the testosterone was at about 70 (double what it had been when i was diagnosed with pcos at 16) and my tsh was about 4.6. she didn’t test for antibodies like i asked or any of the other tests she promised she’d do. she said she thought maybe the testosterone (and subsequently, the tsh) was high because of the cryselle i’d been taking for 9 months (which is about when i started gaining weight) and she switched me to ortho tri cyclen, (my mom didn’t want me on yaz) saying we’d retest my levels in about a month. we did, and they weren’t lower, they were both a little higher (tsh and testosterone, and i have my t3 and t4 somewhere if that’s relevant but it’d take me a bit to find them). so, she said that since my tsh was higher, about 5.6, she would recommend thyroid hormone, and she wanted to put me on something for testosterone, but then called back and said nevermind, i’m not prescribing anything, see an endocrinologist (understandable, since she’s not comfortable with the complexities of this, but frustratingly handled).

it took forever to get into an endo and i have to drive 6 hours to see her, but she specializes in pcos and thyroid disorders. i met with her about 3 weeks ago and she said she’s not entirely convinced it’s the thyroid but we’d start me on 50mcg levothyroxine to see what happens since i thought it was my thyroid. 

i’ll mention some other symptoms: debilitating fatigue, lack of motivation, irritability, dry skin, lots of short little hairs at the back of my neck that might be from breakage and falling out?, joint pain (mostly my knees). i do NOT experience sensitivity to temperature or significant brain fog. 

i don’t even know why i typed all this out. i’m just endlessly frustrated. no one is convinced it’s my thyroid, and now i’m not sure it is either. why is my testosterone so high suddenly? should i be on medication for that? what caused the weight gain? it’s IMPOSSIBLE to lost weight (i mean 1200 calories of low carb low sugar, working out 5 days a week, still gaining weight). people seem to think that at worst it’s subclinical hypothyroidism, although i think the symptoms fit. it also runs in my family—idk if anyone had hashimoto’s, but many women on both my mom and dad’s side have been medicated for their thyroid or had it removed. i’ve been taking the levo for maybe 10 days, so I know it’s impossible to tell if it’s making a difference yet. im just scared that i’m not hypothyroid and it’s the wrong medication. plus, is it possible i don’t have pcos? the symptoms of the two overlap so how do i know for sure which is causing the problems? are there other things it could be? 

i’m just at my wits end with the weight gain. it’s so frustrating and i don’t know what to do. i’m so scared of gaining more, or getting diabetes or something else. i’m probably insulin resistant, right? should i be on metformin? is there anything i can do for that besides metformin, which is absolutely miserable for me to swallow? diet/lifestyle change doesn’t work. i’ve eliminated gluten and dairy before and it doesn’t seem to make a huge difference, but i still try not to go overboard with them.

currently, i’m attending a yoga class and trying to eat protein, fat, fiber & greens at every meal to stabilize my blood sugar (kelly leveque’s recommendation, and it seems to at least keep me full for longer) taking the ortho tri cyclen and the 50 mcg levothyroxine. i guess i just hope this works. i’m glad i caught it early i guess, but i don’t want to keep battling this the rest of my life. any advice is so so appreciated and i apologize for making this incredibly long and probably convoluted."

259,ELISA test (for a dummy) hormones in feces," 

Hi all!

I'm  currently in a masters program (not medical, though) and my thesis will require me to measure levels of testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, and  vasopressin in fecal samples (from gorillas).  The problem is that while  I know gorilla stuff, and basic hormonal stuff, I have no earthly idea how to test for this stuff.

I've been  advised that ELISA is the way to go, but none of my advisors have any  idea what that actually means.  I've got a tiny bit of knowledge, but it  seems like ELISA is just a name for a whole bunch of tests.

My questions are:

Can  anyone direct me to just a solid resource to learn about this stuff?   I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos and tried to wade through the  information I can find, but it's not really helping.

How much does ELISA cost (roughly)?

Does  anyone know if you even can use feces as a medium for ELISA?  All the  references I am finding to this are pathogen related.  (I do know how to  process the feces, but nothing after it's been chemically extracted.)

And  (I'm assuming this is possible, but just be sure) can you test for levels of testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, and vasopressin with ELISA?

I'm considering just buying a kit to try to figure stuff out that way, but asking around seems less expensive and slapdash.

ANY help/advice is very much appreciated.  :)

My question is, as common as it is to have benign thyroid nodules, is the hoarseness usually associated with malignant ones?

\- A requested MRI scan of the pituitary gland has been done and the report can be checked out at the following link :

Critical note : I've seen some pictures of hypogonadism symptoms and I think that I'm not being suffered from this disease. The thing which should be really considered is that I've had an addiction to masturbate since when I was 12 years old which still unfortunately is continuing as of now, for two or three times per day as an average.

I'm sure that my incomplete puberty is just due to constantly over-using the necessary hormone - i.e. Testosterone - indirectly during growing up years (puberty period) by over-masturbating.

Please help me out to diagnose the disease and possibly find its remedy.

268,What is the mechanism thru which thyroid hormones promote growth and development of tissues?,"I'm thinking it's one of 2 ways: 

1. Thyroid hormones bind to receptors in nucleus to trigger DNA transcription of enzymes that build tissues 
2. Thyroid hormones bind to receptors in nucleus to trigger DNA transcription of enzymes that breakdown glucose in cells so that the cell can use the resulting energy to secrete enzymes that build tissues. 

But I'm sure there are more detailed, accurate ways to explain how the process works?"
269,Why are my cortisol levels high?,"I had a blood test at my GP surgery and they tested my cortisol levels by accident, along with whatever else they were testing for. They called me in for a repeat blood test because they discovered that my cortisol levels were high. To get the most accurate reading I had the second lot of blood taken in an early morning appt. (8:30 am) as time of day can affect the result. This came back showing my cortisol levels were even higher! Now I’m having a third blood test and the Dr is going to send it to endocrinology to have a look at as she is a bit puzzled. 

Does anyone know why my cortisol levels might be so high? Googling symptoms is just scary. 
Thanks in advance. "
270,Excessive sweating with almost no exertion. Long term prednisone use. Endocrinologist hasn't been able to figure it out.,"Hi all,

Had a thought to come to reddit to maybe crowd source some help.  Will try to keep this from becoming a wall of text but if more information is needed, please let me know.

My current issue is that after a tiny amount of exertion, I get immediately fatigued and start sweating heavily.  The neck on my shirt gets completely soaked through in a matter of minutes.  We're talking standing around in an air conditioned house, folding laundry or walking around while on the phone.  I'm 40 years old and have never been a heavy sweater.  I also have lower body muscle weakness.  If i squat down, I  do not have the leg strength to stand back up on my own.  

I've been on steroids (prednisone, dexamethasone, kenalog) for crohn's and cluster headaches since March.  I tapered off the prednisone in early August and my last dexamethasone and kenalog injections were mid-September.

After visiting an endocrinologist and doing some blood work, we found that my cortisol levels  were almost non existent and I have been on hydrocortisone for the last couple of months.  we also found that my testosterone levels were low and i've been taking injections (completed 2 so far).

Has anyone experienced this kind of sweating and fatigue before after steroid use?  Any insights on a fix?  I don't think the hydrocortisone is doing the job and i'm really getting frustrated with the lack of progress from my doctor."
271,Topical Estrogen On Biological Male,"I am a 28 year old, and biologically male (though I'm fairly certain I'm a tetragametic chimera, can't be sure what gender the twin was at this time or how much of their cell line survives where), and I'm trying to grow breasts beacuse it feels right for me, it's something I need. I don't want to sacrifice reproductive capability, though, at least not at this point in my life (as I'd like to have kids with my wife, and yes she's OK with this and knows what I'm doing in case anyone wonders).

I've got what I'd identify as tanner stage 3 breast development, though I'm 6' and roughly 260lbs, so perhaps some of that is being exaggerated, though I'd suspect not since there's not an abundance of fat, it's mostly tissues by feel.

I've tried lots of nipple stimulation, pumping, using vacuum cups for breast and nipple and taking a supplement with fenugreek seed extract and a smaller amount of some phytoestrogenic plants ([https://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Select-Supplement-Marshmallow-Breastfeeding/dp/B00IOWCB7Q](https://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Select-Supplement-Marshmallow-Breastfeeding/dp/B00IOWCB7Q) \- 600mg per pill, I'm taking one per day). I would like to lactate at some point, but after strictly adhering to a pumping regimen for a month or so I decided that it would likely be easier if I try again after more breast development has occurred.

Anyway, as you may have noticed from my post title that's all background information. My real question is where I've got to bow out as an amateur endocrinologist and ask those with more knowledge. I figured a good way to get a boost of estrogen to my breast tissue would be to apply it topically, quite possibly one of the post-menopausal relief creams as those are an abundant non-prescription source. I realize, though, that some amount is liable to enter the bloodstream. I don't want to nuke my reproductive capability, so I'd like input as to whether this is likely to be a problematic amount of estrogen entering the bloodstream or if it should be minimal. If there is no way to know due to individual absorption/etc. then how fast \*could\* the onset of negative side effects for the male reproductive tract be? I can get estrogen level testing done at intervals after starting the cream if there's simply not enough data on this sort of situation, and lower the dose or discontinue if levels get too high. I wouldn't want to go experimenting like that without some outside opinions, though.

I realize I could talk to a professional about this in person, but as you may imagine this isn't the most comfortable sort of subject, sort of a ""partial transition"". As well, specialists in doing specific cocktails of hormones aren't the most common, and the area I'm in is unlikely to have that sort of professional available anywhere near me. I know this won't stop people from telling me to visit an endocrinologist, but I wanted to at least temper that with the understanding that I'm aware they exist.

Thank you for any help/input any of you may provide."

273,Why does hyperthyroidism cause arrhythmia that persists when euthyroid?,"Just interested really.

I was diagnosed with Graves’ disease last year. I went straight on carbimazole and propranolol but my TSH stubbornly sat at <0.005 despite the meds, after 6 months I pushed for a total thyroidectomy. Shortly before the surgery happened I started to go into SVT on the regular. After surgery I was overtly hypothyroid (I took lugol’s iodine and a mega dose of carbimazole in the run up to the op) but the SVT episodes continued very frequently in that time. I still get the odd one now despite taking diltiazem and having been subclinical hypothyroid for months now.

I suppose I’m asking what did Graves’ do that has left me with an arrhythmia I didn’t have pre-Graves? Could it be associated with the high blood pressure I had between diagnosis and thyroid removal? My BP was around 160/100 over those 6 months (it went up to 180/120 when I had flu)"

280,What is causing my high cortisol?,"Seriously, how common is pseudo Cushing’s? Cyclical? I keep getting up and down cortisol levels.

Does pseudo Cushing’s act like this? I thought pseudo from major depressive disorder would be more of a constant elevation. I’m going to be doing the DDAVP stim test soon, but if that is inconclusive and points to pseudo, I don’t know what to do anymore to fix this. I have glucose issues mimicking diabetes but only sometimes, hypertension, tachycardia, major hair loss (I’m literally balding in a male pattern yet have normal free and bioavailable testosterone and Dheas is always in range although goes up when my cortisol is high. There is also no family history of female hair loss and this started suddenly and is rapidly getting worse), also increased vellus hair all over my body which seems to be getting darker, skin is thinning badly as well. The skin thinning and hair loss are the only physical presentations that my endos take note of as being suspicious. 

What is causing this? Any opinions? Am I just left to fend for myself now if drs don’t think I have a tumor? Seems unfair, I have a hormone imbalance obviously but they just don’t know why. Why can’t they just give me korlym or Keto like they do for confirmed CS patients? I have confirmed high cortisol."
281,Help with thyroid testing/hormonal issues/adrenal issues (I'M A MESS!),"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I am going to a new endo soon and I want to get thyroid testing done (AGAIN). I've had my thyroid tested a few separate times in my life, always because I was dealing with symptoms that aligned with thyroid issues, and my Mom has hashimoto's.

&#x200B;

Two years ago now, I went to a naturopath and had my hormones and adrenals tested because I had lost my period for over 6 months (still don't have it back). I was told I had food sensitivities (I have digestive issues I'm still dealing with even with avoiding certain foods), told I had adrenal fatigue (my cortisol levels are chronically low), and that both my progesterone and estrogen were low, but my ratio was estrogen dominant.

&#x200B;

My naturopath recommended elimination diets, supplements, etc. My gyno recommended birth control (don't want to do this unless absolutely necessary). But I'm STILL dealing with these issues AND NOW my once THICK BEAUTIFUL hair is now so thin and whispy! I LEGIT HAVE BALD SPOTS AROUND MY TEMPLES. This has all happened within a matter of a month or so. I have also noticed my weight is unstable - I'll retain water for weeks and then suddenly drop it all. And just the past few days, I've noticed my heart palpitations are back.

&#x200B;

ANY advice is welcome. It all sounds like thyroid to me, but I guess could be related to adrenals? I'm just so lost on how to fix it. I want to STOP going to new doctors and having to get new blood work done, all to continually feel hopeless.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations on specific thyroid tests to ask for? I know sometimes you really have to advocate for yourself to get the right testing!

&#x200B;

Thanks if you read all this <3

Further, why aren't there more inject-able or transdermal options, given that pills supposedly increase DVT risk?","I am so skeeved out by current birth control options due to the synthetic hormones and the actual method resulting in supposed increased risks.

As the title says, why aren't there birth control options with bioidentical estrogen + bioidentical progesterone? I could only find options that have bio-E but never with bio-P to accompany.

Also, why aren't there more inject-able or transdermal options for birth control or even cis-female HRT in general, given that pills supposedly increase DVT and perhaps even breast cancer risk?"
283,Elevated DHEA-S: Anyone with info?,"This is my story:

I’m 25, female, 170 lbs, 5’5”. I’ve always had a more athletic or curvy build, but never masculine, even now. My entire life I’ve been healthy and active with no medical problems, always extremely fortunate. 

When I was about 23, I started developing severe anxiety and stress. It was like I was constantly waiting for something bad to happen. It felt like chronic worry. My “mood swings” came and went, but always became more extreme. I was so easily irritated, constantly pessimistic, even found myself being disciplined at my places of work for my inappropriate attitudes with customers. It was like I was angry or burnt out, mentally, all the damn time. I kind of adapted to that way of living for a year or so. Granted, it wasn’t 24/7. Like I said, it came and went. I was still a happy person, deep down. I just ended up losing a lot of kind people to the rage within me. It felt kind of hopeless.

Fast forward 5 months, and I noticed I started feeling happier. I was focusing more on positivity and working out 5 days a week + eating a little better. I was also in a new relationship. 

That’s when the weird symptoms became apparent. 

I had experienced severe pelvic pain with sex for probably 2 years now, but it became almost unbearable. I would go to have sex with my boyfriend, and I’d find myself wincing and flinching before the pain even came on, because I was so wary of it. Neither of us could enjoy ourselves, and I always felt guilty. I also felt increasingly stressed out all of the time. Like, I would be 2 mins late for work, and I would start sweating and feel as if I was having some kind of panic attack + adrenaline rush, when it was literally not a big deal. Mentally, I knew that, too. Physically, my body was freaking out. I mean, I constantly started feeling like a roller coaster of stressful up and downs. I was picking fights with everyone, because even the tiniest of things would trigger my anxiety to spike, and I hated the way I felt. Also, my acne became uncontrollable. I never have truly battled with acne in my life, aside from the occasional break out during my menstrual cycle, but this was all the time, and I couldn’t cure it. I realized I couldn’t leave the house without concealer in my purse, and I’d been doing that for 5 months without recognizing it as “wait, is this a symptom of a bigger problem?” 

Then, I ended up in a ball on my bed, with a heating pad wrapped around my abdomen, bawling hysterically for an entire weekend - And I wasn’t even on my period! That following Monday, my mom took me to the ER. They didn’t seem very concerned for me, but agreed to do a pelvic ultrasound. They discovered 1 small cyst on my left ovary, which I found so ironic, because the majority of my pain was on my right side. They sent me home with a Tylenol-3 scrip and told me to follow up with my OBGYN. 

I followed up with the OB. She insisted that my Paragard Copper IUD was the source of my pain, and she advised having it removed. I told her I would consider that, but the reason I chose that source of birth control is because it is nonhormonal. I had a gut feeling that something is/was wrong with me. I asked her to run a full blood panel on me. I wanted to know my hormone levels, my fertility, anything she could tell me. 

A few days later, I got my results back from the lab. My DHEA-S is 443, and my AMH is 1.9. They said I’d likely need to seek IVF and have my eggs frozen to ensure my chances of having children in the future... but, I don’t understand how my DHEA-S level is so damn high, while literally EVERY other thing was completely normal. My estrogen, testosterone, prolactin, etc. you name it! All normal. 

Everything I’ve read on the internet is telling me I have an adrenal tumor, and the symptoms kind of line up, but not totally. 

My first appointment with an endocrinologist isn’t for another 5 weeks, and I’ve already been waiting 1 month. I’m so stressed (lol) of what to expect / would be so appreciative of any conversation regarding this. I can’t seem to find anyone who’s gone through anything similar. "

287,Cushings and Adrenal Crisis,"Hello, 

I have some general questions, if you have Mild/Episodic Cushings Syndrome, can you go into adrenal crisis when your cortisol goes lower than usual? 
I ask because I am at a loss.. Because well, I look physically like I have cushings syndrome, but yet have the internal termoils and feelings of addisons disease... 

I have had Cushings symptoms all my life, until 20, when I began having wild stomach pains and vomiting and ER admissions with massive amounts of weight loss. Eventually I was diagnosed with 'IBS' - nothing treats it, and like I said, I ended up in the hospital quite frequently -eventually going from 350lbs to 180lbs durring my worst time(took about a year for that weight drop, I was 22) I have slowly got a bit better from staying away from stressors, using panic medications and anti-depressants, but its not really done anything but lessen the frequency of my hospital trips to every 2-3 months. I have wondered is it possible to have had cushings(weight gain, buffalo hump, and many more symptoms) until age 20, and than burn out my adrenal gland, putting me into a state of barely functioning/adrenal infufficency? 
My weight has slowly begun to increased since the age of about 23 again, and now I am about 234lbs. 


** I should also mention, I have an IUD(Mirena) it was inserted in 2009 for bad periods(was tested for endometriosis, cysts and pcos=negitive), and ran out in 2014(when my weight loss and symptoms went from bad to its worst), it was later replaced(2015) and my symptoms got mildly more controllable like before it ran out(I figure as my PMS was always bad, the added stress from pain, etc, made the addrenal insufficency worse??) 

Within the last month I was now diagnosed with PCOS, however, the treatements are the IUD, good eating, exercise, hormones etc. My IUD has never overly changed my symptoms, until my onset of symptoms from 'IBS' much after, eatting well still can send me to the ER(one day chicken can be fine;another day not), and no matter how much I work out, or exercise my body never seems to respond accordingly.. So I honestly wonder...

Could I have something else going on?? 

My dex test supressed my cortisol to 13nmol, but with mild/Ectopic Cushings and adrenal insuffocency this is normal. I am wondering however.. Its even possible in the first place to look like you have cushings.. And yet actually BE adrenally insuffocent? :/ 


Someone please help me. 
I feel like I am going in circles. 

Thank you in advance for reading, and any insight you offer!!

288,First Hormone Panel,"I (26F) just had my first hormone panel done. I suffer from bladder/urethra pain and vulvodynia (vaginal pain). My vulvar/vaginal skin is delicate and prone to tearing. This, plus the provoked pain makes sex impossible.

 At this point and for years now, I have had a low libido. I have previously been on birth control, but I am not currently on it and haven't been in years. The only supplements/vitamins I am taking at Vit B, Vit D and probiotics. I am slightly underweight, have an irregular cycle ranging from 28-40 days, have low blood pressure and do not have excessive hair or any of the other symptoms I have seen listed for PCOS. The panel was run in my luteal phase of my cycle.

These are my test results:

**Dhea Sulfate:** 317 µg/dL (age 18-30 59-432 µg/dL)

**Progesterone, Serum:** 9.84 ng/mL (Luteal Phase 1.83-23.90)

**Estradiol:** 118.9 pg/mL (FOLLICULAR PHASE 21.8 - 83.7 MIDCYCLE PEAK 197.6 - 693.1 LUTEAL PHASE 189.9 - 269.7 POSTMENOPAUSAL 32.1 - 73.1) **FITS IN NONE OF THE RANGES**

**Prolactin:** 52.4 ng/mL (2.1 - 47.6 ng/mL)  **HIGH**

**Total Testosterone:** 96.7 ng/dL (8.4 - 48.1 ng/dL) **HIGH**

**Free Testosterone:** 6.5 pg/mL (1.0 - 6.0 pg/mL) **HIGH**

**SHBG:** 128.8 nmol/L (18.5 - 153.2)

**FSH:** 3.5 mIU/mL (1.0 - 200.0)

**LH:** 7.4 mIU/mL (0.2 - 200.0 1)

My gynecologist is sending me to a endocrinologist, but they didn't have an available appointment for months. I am curious about the connections between the 4 measurements (Estradiol, Prolactin, Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone) that are outside their ranges. Also if I could still have PCOS without the ""regular"" symptoms? And anything else you notice!

292,"Hair loss due to Secondary PCOS, or caused by prolactinoma?","Hi guys, I'm posting my questions here because there aren't many endocrinologists available soon in my city, and my university doctors are against testing for something an endo didn't refer.

So I am a 23yr old female, had a history of PCOvaries when I was 17 which went away after taking the prescribed BC 6 years ago, I stopped BC after 6 mo when the cysts were gone and my insurance ran out. Fast forward to college life, and I have maintained the same weight, but gained a good amount of muscle. I am 165 lbs, 5'5"", so still overweight. I suspected I had PCOS due to irregular cycles in the past (which had been normalized for about a year) and inability to lose weight. Blood tests this march showed high DHEA-S (297) and slightly elevated prolactin. Normal testosterone (35ng/ml) . I noticed hair shedding 4 years ago but was told it was stress. It went away, but my hair has kept thinning in density since. 

This August it began to fall fall, not just shed. I  got blood tests done at a clinic, and was given Spironolactone for hair loss. I was told I didn't have PCOS-like symptoms when I brought it up. When school was back in session I went to my university Dr. and was told I still had high DHEA-S (230, dropped a little maybe due to spiro?), normal testosterone (23ng/ml dropped a little)  but prolactin had doubled. I was found to have a 5mm microadenoma and was given cabergoline .5mg/week by an endocrinologist's nurse. I have yet to meet the endocrinologist due to a lot of patients. 

&#x200B;

Since I suspected PCOS I asked for testing, which was confirmed by an ultrasound last week- with one ovary with over 12 follicles. They also think I have a septate uterus, heart shaped split by some sort of muscle. So, now I have 

1.normal testosterone

2.  high prolactin due to microadenoma or PCOS

3. high DHEA-S

4. Normal Progesterone (taken during who knows when in my cycle, so it may not be)

5. Normal TSH, TPO, T3, T4, Free T4

6. slightly raised cortisol 

7. slightly raised blood glucose (106), but normal A1C.

8. Normal Iron, low Iron % saturation (I have taken supplements for a year, my body has a hard time absorbing vit D and Fe) 

The last 3 measurements my GP told me were insignificant and that my endo will take care of my PCOS symptoms. To me, this looks like insulin resistance? I don't want to wait to see what I can do to help my body. 

It's been and 3 months since my hair is falling, I can see part of my scalp at the back now. Eyelashes and eyebrows were shedding too but have subsided a bit. I was having a lot of vaginal dryness, Bacterial Vaginosis, some hot flashes, also got Seborrheic dermatitis for the first time (confirmed by derm) and ongoing depression and anxiety chiefly to my hair situation. My guess was, maybe it's low estrogen due to high PRL? The clinic didn't mention it, but my estrogen level came to 27pg/ml, which is low. I got it tested last week and it's 79, which can be low depending on my cycle phase.

So my question is, what do you think the hair situation is due to? It's really alarming how much falls. before my ultrasound I was ok with trusting the process of the cabergoline and hope my levels would all even out. But now, Idk if its PCOS hair loss. My doc wont test for IR. So, I guess I'm confused!  I don't know where my DHEA-S are going, is they aren't converting to high T or high Estrogen, what could be going on?

293,"Salt craving, low blood pressure in the morning. Odd experiences with glucocorticoids and suspicion of a problem with the steroidogenesis pathway","This is going to be a bit of a rant, not everything has to do directly with endocrinology, but I've
included some related topice to give you a better picture where I come from. Please bear with me.

Let me start by sagin that I've been diagnosed with high functioning autism about 12y ago and that I
usually manage quite well. However I've been having some odd symptoms for years now, including salt
cravings, spells of extreme tiredness (which go away after eating salt and drinking water), and low
stress tolerance. I've taken to manually regulate my salt and water levels by suplementing NaCl, and
making sure I drink about 2l a day. This has not seemed odd for me, since I already need to do a lot
of things, which should be automatic for most people, manually, due to my autism.

I have a Masters Degree (Physical Chemistry) and also worked in Biochemistry for my PhD attemt.

I also have a slightly elevated blood pressure during the day, while in the mornings I have very
low blood pressure (if I get up right after waking up I risk fainting). It usually takes about
30 minutes for my blood pressure to rise in the morning.
I have a BMI of about 36.5 (I am working hard to reduce this).

When I was a child, due to asthma and allergies, made worse due to environmental factors, I've gotten
relatively high doses of corticosteroids (I don't know exactly how much and how often, since I know
this from my mother).

I have had some odd experiences with doctors (probably due to my autism), which is why I use doctors
in an odd fashion. I rarely go to a doctor without having a very good idea what the problem is, and
I like to soak in as much knowledge about those parts of medicine that are more relavant to me. I
probably know more about autism than anyone who isn't an expert in that special field.

About 15 years ago, I have investigated allergies since the 2nd generation antihistamines that where
recommended by my doctor, and which work well for my father, are as effective as taking tic-tacs to
treat allergies. After doing some research I came upon the 1st generation antihistamines which are
not normally used to treat allergies where I live, but are still readily available as over-the-counter
medicine.

After trying these after a quick check with my doctor, I had the luxury of being able to breathe throug
my nose the first time in over a decade. Since I have many food allergies, and only really have a window
in late sumemr / early autumn where there is not some kind of pollen flying around that I am allergic
to, I usually take them most of the year.

Unfortunately I will slowly build up a tolerance to the Clemastin I use, and while I've tried
using Diphenhydramine for a while (which has more side effects for me), this doesn't work very well.
I have used Prednisolone, dosed betweeen 10 and 20 mg per day, for usually one but upt to two weeks,
tapering off the dose afterwards (yes I'm a bit overcareful). My doctor knows about this, and while
he gave me the typical warnings about glucocorticoids, he agreed that using it for a short time, about
once a year holds little risk.

I already use Prednisolone as an emergency medication for some of my food allergies (some are extremely
strong, but I'm lucky my allergies usually have a slow onset).

One odd thing that I've noticed every year is that while the antihisamies also have the nice side
effect of clearing the otherwise ever-present mental fog (I don't know how else to describe this),
the Prednisolone does this a lot better.

I usually get a bad cougth when I get a cold, the cold is gone after 1-2 days, but the dry cougth
stays, if untreated for months. In the past I had tried treating it with antitussives, where only
codeine would even put a dent in the tissive irritation. After over a week I am often unable to sleep
without an antitussive, becausse when I lie down the cougth gets worse. I've been taking budesonide
spray during this time, with only mild improvement when increasing the dose as my doctor recommended.

When I did the antihistamine reset during this time one year, I found that prednisolone works a lot
better than anything else, and just increasing my dose to 40mg/day for a week, the cougth which
usually stayed for at least a few weeks, was gone after a bit over a week.

This year, I've been having some stress with projects at work, my cat is very sick, and I got the
cougth earlier than usual. As expected the Prednisolone not only helped with the cougth and let me
stop using the antihistamines to manage my allergies, it also helped a lot with the stress, especially
since I had a death in my family shortly after starting the treatment.

Four three days I switched to 4mg of dexametasone per day, with another 2mg on the fourth day, all
the while plotting the prednisolone equivalient dose. I was fascinated how well I could deal with a
stressful, quite emotional and new situation of the funeral, something that I'd usually have a lot
of trouble dealing with. After the funeral I decided to reduce the dose, and stopped taking anything
for three days after the 2mg dose.

I had written a software at this point which calculates the prednisolone equivalent dose in the body,
taking into account the relative strengths (and the error in that value) and the range of half times
I could find for both prednisolone and dexametasone, building a model of the current dose in my body,
and giving me a good idea of the error of that dose.

The peak expected value for the dose in my body (in mg Prednisolone equivalent) was ~100mg, which is
equivalent to taking 50mg/day. After stopping to take glucocorticoids 8 days in, I let the expected                                                          
value drop to 40mg, while ensuring the lower end of the value with error does not drop below 20mg,                                                           
before I started to use low dose Prednisolone to catch the dose.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                             
In this time of relatively high dose glucocorticoids I have noticed that not only am I capable of                                                            
dealing with social and emotional situations, which would usually have me struggle and resort to                                                             
mild self harm to be able to even remotely cope with the situation, but it also improved on a lot                                                            
of other problems I had. I could suddenly multi-task without difficulty, my auditory and visual                                                              
filters worked very well (so no sensory overload, which helped a lot to deal with things), and                                                               
while not completely gone, my hunger for salt was a fraction of what it usually is, and suddenly                                                             
I could get out of bed as soon as I woke up, no need even for coffee to bring me up to speed in the                                                          
morning.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                             
While the filtering and other mental effects went away as I dropped below 40mg Prednisolone equivalent                                                       
dose, the lack of salt hunger stayed with me, as did the ease of waking up. As an experiment I kpet the                                                      
equivalent dose between 20mg and 10mg by taking 10mg of Prednisolone daily for a few days, before                                                            
reducing the dose to 5mg daily for a full week.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                             
While the equivalent dose was not sinking below 10mg, I could still get up with ease and had very                                                            
little craving for salt, after reducing the dose, to 5mg a day, getting up in the morning got a bit                                                          
more difficult, but I still get up faster than usual.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
When reducing the dose to an alternating between 5mg and 2.5mg per day for 6 days, before I'm planning                                                       
to reduce it to 2.5mg/day, I noticed that I suddenly get very tired during the day, and need to watch                                                        
my salt and water intake again. Thay was yesterday, the first dose of 2.5mg. This morning getting up                                                         
was harder than the days before as well.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                             
I suspect there is something wrong with the steroidogenesis system. Some mutation in one of the                                                              
enzymes that causes reduced activity. I figure this explains both the salt craving, and what I                                                               
suspect it my bodies inability to provide enough glucocorticoid for stressful situations and when                                                            
sudden spikes are norman (in the morning). While at the same time still providing enough glucocorticoid                                                      
activity to prevent any severe insufficies.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                             
Yes I know, I should really get a bloodwork done with all the steroids in the steroidogenesis pathway                                                        
included to see if my suspicion is right. I don't mind being proven wrong, especially when it also provides
me with an alternative explanaition. It's just odd how profound the changes are when I'm taking prednisolone.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                             
My other suspicion is that somehow, maybe due to the large doses of glucocorticoids I got as a child,                                                        
my adrenal grands just can't cope with the peak output needed, while still being able to provide the                                                         
base amount of cortisol.

Please comment, and ask questions. My goal is to find out why I'm having this now quite obvious problem with
keeping salt in my body, and to resolve the cause of it, and my low blood-pressure problem in the morning.
I don't want a diagnosis, I know I'll have to see a doctor for that, but with my experience of how I'm often
misunderstood by doctors, I found the only way to deal with misunderstandings is to actually speak to them as
a very informed patient. I can communicate science with few misunderstandings, I can't orally communicate what I've
summarised here very well.

I plan on seeing a doctor once I've narrowed down the possible problems, but I admit that while I understand the
biochemistry very well, I have little knowledge about the subtleties of the endocrine system, and its biological effects
on the body. I'd also be curious if someone could explain any of my observations.

294,DHEA deficiency (blood diagnosis) - could this be the cause why i cant feel any emotion at all?,"Also got my DHEA through saliva tested (both deficient)

i suffer from chronic emotional nubmness probably developed through chronic stress.



my DHEA is defiecent for many years lets say if the minimum range in the blood test is 200. im at approx 100 for DHEA (im not sure what number exactly cuz i havent got my blood tests here).


years ago i could feel sadness but now i cant even feel that anymore.. im just extremely flat  maybe sometimes blunted but most flat in every emotion.. 

could DHEA fix this? i mean i read 2-3 studies that people could correc the flat affect by dhea but the studies are over 10 years old and i havent read anywhere else that DHEA helped someone for emotional numbness (maybe i did? . cant remember if)

would appreciate any answers. THX!"
295,Hormonal Imbalance on Yaz. Is this normal?,"First off, thank you for reading this case. I hope I can get some idea from this forum about what is going on with my health.

Some back story about me:
-I am a 23 year old female
-I eat healthy and exercise regularly
-I am only taking Yaz and have been taking it for approximately 2 years
-No other medications
-Possible celiacs disease, I am currently waiting for the biopsy results after having a positive blood test

I have been taking birth control since I was 16 years old due to having very heavy and painful cycles. I missed a lot of school due to the pain and I was bleeding a lot for a long time. My cycles were very unpredictable and did not regulate over the years. I first got my cycle when I was 12 years old and in the 4 years until I went on birth control, it did not regulate. It would happen every two weeks to four months, and last a really long time. I have been to a gynecologist and went for a laparoscopy to see if I had endometriosis, but it was negative. This procedure was conducted while on birth control.

I have been prescribed and have been taking the pill continuously and taking a break once a year as requested by my doctor. Even on the pill, my cycles are so unbearable so I skip them. But they are much better than my regular cycles.

However, about three years ago, I had a routine blood test done at my family doctor and he found my estrogen levels very low. He said they were at the level that menopausal women are at. Since then, I have changed my pill from Ortho-Cyclen to Yaz. I love Yaz and it has been great for me, until recently. I recently went back to my doctor because I was experiencing a flood of symptoms. My hair has been thinning drastically, my skin is very dry, I'm so incredibly exhausted that I feel like I cannot function, I'm unable to sleep, I feel very sad and depressed, low sex drive, depending on coffee to get me through the day, and I also monitor my blood glucose and blood pressure due to a family history of issues with diabetes and my levels would not spike or drop, no matter what I ate or when I tested my blood (e.g. I ate a piece of cake and tested 10 minutes after, which should be very high, but it was at 4.2). Also, my blood pressure keeps dropping very low (I have seen it get to 65/43). 

Due to having these symptoms, my doctor sent me for blood work and the following were reported:
-again, my estrogen was at menopausal levels... So very very low.
-high prolactin levels
-very high cortisol levels
-normal/low FSH
-thyroid antibodies present, but normal thyroid levels
-iron, vitamins, cbc, etc...everything else was normal

I do not have my result values as those are all computed and only my doctors have access to them.

I have been sent to an internalist, who referred me to an endocrinologist, but unfortunately I won't be able to meet with the endocrinologist for another 2 months... I was sent for an ultrasound on my thyroid which was normal and an MRI to check for pituitary tumors which came back normal also. My symptoms are really affecting my life!

I am hoping that someone can throw out some ideas of what they think it could be. I want to take some ideas with me when I go to the endocrinologist so I have some questions to ask. I have had doctors tell me I may have PCOS but I think my levels do not reflect PCOS (usually there is high estrogen, not low). 

Thank you so much for reading through all of this. I appreciate all of the advice and help that I can get! "

297,"(36 / M) feeling tired, weak, lightheaded and jaw clenching after eating","I've been having a lot of weird symptoms for about 2 years now and it's driving me insane. Not sure if tis is the right place but i'm getting desperate.

When i eat something i often (pretty much every day at least once) start to feel lightheaded and foggy, almost like being high or drunk. At the same time i get tired and feel weak, like all the energy drains from my body. Sometimes this fatigue is accompanied by a feeling of being very wired, like i just drank a pot of coffee. It's a bit hard to explain because it feels like i'm cycling trough different kinds of feeling tired. I've never fainted but did feel like i wasn't far off a few times.

My jaw muscles constantly feel tight like screws are being tightened on the sides of my head and make cracking/popping sounds, sometimes very loud. The tightness and cracking is always there but gets either worse or better not long after i eat. I'm not clenching my teeth together by the way.

I've been to my doctor multiple times about this but she can't seem to find anything. The only weird thing in my blood test one time was my blood sugar being low (3 mmol/L) and this was taken about 30 minutes after i had lunch and felt very tired and groggy/high. After this my doctor ordered another kind of test that checks blood sugar over the last few months (forgot the name) and that came back fine, twice.

I'm closer to being underweight than overweight (1:90m / 72kg), don't smoke, hardly ever drink, not on any medication, and eat pretty healthily. I feel like shit almost all the time and eating only makes it worse. I haven't noticed a big difference in what i eat but after lunch time is usually the worst. Sugar seems to be the most reliable in giving me that feeling of being high but now and then it also happens when i haven't eaten anything. After eating dinner i usually feel a bit better but only for about an hour or so. I don't exercise much because a few times i've been completely floored afterwards and hardly capable of moving for the rest of the day.

305,Low renin low aldosterone?,"33 M.

&#x200B;

I've been suffering from a number of hormonal issues (for a few years now) but one super prominent symptom is that I carry a lot of water retention and my body feels like the desert. Sometimes I can't even talk cause my mouth is so dry. And when I do talk, I get even drier, argh. My lips are constantly chapped and I find it hard to make facial expressions due to all the water retention in my face. 

&#x200B;

I find that drinking salt water helps me and sometimes I find that I can drink salty water non-stop. I often crave it and it doesn't feel normal. 

&#x200B;

I recently paid for my own blood test and the results were:

&#x200B;

Renin: 0.93 ng/mL/h (Range: 0.20 - 1.60 Supine, 0.70 - 3.30 Upright)

Aldosterone: 5.6 ng/dL

&#x200B;

Are these on the low side? Could they be partly responsible for the electrolyte symptoms I'm experiencing? What are some alternative therapies I could try? I'm currently looking for a new endocrinologist but in the meantime I'd love to know what sort of action I can take now.

307,Question about thyroid levels during levothyroxine dose change and values / also taking with breakfast,"Hi there,

I changed my diet to gluten free, soy free, dairy free, and... my TSH tanked.  It went from 1.8 to .4 in about 6 weeks.  I'm on Tirosint because of Lithium, and all of those values are normal.  I had a standing order so I had it drawn, and they found the .451.  So, they wanted to change my meds, which at first I was hesitant, I hadn't changed them in 5 years.  But I eventually went from 150mcg to 137mcg, and in the meantime I've been a mess.  I've been crying, anxious, etc, it hasn't been a fun time.  I had my numbers drawn (by myself by Labcorp just for kicks in the meantime) and it looks like not much has changed, although I didn't grab my free T4 again, which was originally 1.84.   

I'm not sure if my numbers will help...

TSH 0.177 Low uIU/mL 0.450 - 4.500 01

Thyroxine (T4) 10.0 ug/dL 4.5 - 12.0 01

T3 Uptake 27 % 24 - 39 01

Free Thyroxine Index 2.7 1.2 - 4.9

So I guess what I'm wondering is, over time, is there a curve or any data for showing what should happen in the next couple of weeks or during the course of a med change?  It only seems that I had issues when I made the change, but now I'm fearing the worst, that something might be wrong.  I'm really banking on it being diet, and the fact that I used to just take my Tirosint with breakfast, which I might go back to doing.  Also, if anyone has any insight into value changes with eating, I'd love to see that.

Everyone tells me I'm too young for prostate problems and too young for breast cancer.

I'm assuming it's not cancer of any kind, being that I've had these issues for years. The cancer would have spread and killed me a long time ago.

312,Should the normal range for TSH be lowered?,"Hi there clever people.

&#x200B;

So, I'm having a TSH that's a bit high, and I'm a bit worried about it as I have read that anything above 3 or even 2,5 is abnormal even though the normal ranges go up to 5.

&#x200B;

My TSH is 3,4 (0,3-4) at the moment. I have been tested a few times the last year and it always comes in between 2,5-5. My doc told me I'm negative for antibodies which I didn't understand the meaning of but I understood that it was a good thing. 

&#x200B;

I'm suffering from very dry skin on my face and my legs and I'm having difficulty sleeping/being calm. Also having trouble concentrating and I have lost quite a bit of hair. 

&#x200B;

At what point do you start patients on medication? I would rather not take anything. On the other hand I don't want to suffer the consequences of walking around with inadequate amounts of thyroid hormone. I'm afraid of harming my body and dying early, basically...

&#x200B;

So what's your view on the current normal ranges, and guidelines for treatment of hypothyroidism? Should the normal range be lowered? Is a TSH of 3-4 normal? Do you want until a certain TSH before starting treatment (my doc says >10)?

313,Whats your opinion on total T reference range?,"(for brevity, I'm going to focus on one diagnostic but realize that theres many other measurements to consider so its not that simple)

Whats your opinion on total T reference range? Does it factor quality of life into account?

In theory someone can be told their ""normal"" despite being at the bottom end of the range. For example, if the reference range is 250-900, telling a symptomatic patient that they are normal because they test at 283 wont be very reassuring.

Also, lets consider two hypothetical scenarios. Both patients are symptomatic.

Patient A tests at 75 and gets therapy, still has symptoms at 290, gets raised to 550 and symptoms are finally treated.

Patient B test at 290 and is brushed aside because he's ""normal"". Symptoms persist. Patient is told psychological issues are responsible for symptoms and that they should go see a therapist. Patient is already seeing a therapist of all the issues they discuss, the driving force behind all of them is the low T symptoms. Patient B is now in a chicken and egg scenario.

Why is this considered OK?

318,Elevated TSH and Thyroperoxidase AB; normal T4,"I have had elevated TSH for years, but T4 has always been centered in the ideal range. It has been my understanding that any replacement, such as levothyroxine, would be supplementing T4. 

I saw a new doctor today and they wish to start me on levothyroxine because of the results. TSH ~11, Thyroperoxidase ~150IU/mL (really high), and T4 1.3.

I’m concerned with this, as it A) feels like they see numbers obviously wrong and just want to medicate as the first response, and B) reading about too much of the hormone (T4/levothyroxine) has me feeling like it could have some bad consequences by medicating when not necessary.

My own research makes me feel like I should be watching the thyroid related numbers, but medicating is wrong at this point. Can someone set me straight and help me trust the medical professional’s recommendation to medicate, or affirm my fears and give me some ground to stand on if saying no to the medication is the right answer? I know I should trust the professionals, but this combined with some of the other things in today’s visit has me concerned enough that I don’t trust their recommendations outright.

319,"Normal Test, Low Free Test, Low Estradiol, Low Human Sex Hormone","Hello, first time posting here, I figured it may be worth a try to get some insight since I cannot find an Endo in my area that can help pinpoint what is going on when trying to assess my labs.

About me: 28 year old male, thyroid removed as a result of thyroid cancer, current thyroid related labs are the best they have ever been, all variables are within the reference range, endo says I could still be upping my dose of Naturethroid a bit more, but overall please to see where my labs are and to see my test levels climbing back up.

&#x200B;

Side note: Extremely active, weight train 4x a week, cardio 2x a week, well balanced diet, supplement with Vit D, Zinc/Copper, Fish Oil, B complex, and drink plenty of water.

&#x200B;

Over the last few years, I have tracked my blood work pretty well, and several items stand out when reviewing my labs, that being the following:

&#x200B;

Test levels sitting around 550 right now, doesn't seem too low, has gone up considerably

Free test- low, sitting at 9.51, has barely increase, while my test levels have increase a lot

Estradiol is out of reference range, too low, currently sitting around 29, which is a little higher than all my previous labs

Human sex hormone- also low, sitting around 37, hardly increased

DHEA remains low as well, 156, out of reference range.

&#x200B;

It took me a long time to dial in my thyroid and raise my test levels, and I overall feel MUCH better, but my low mood, anixety, insomnia, low sex drive, and brain fog still linger. I now have glimpses of days where I almost feel normal and I know I am on the right track to get my endo system back in align.

&#x200B;

The question remains, why is my T going up, but my Free-T remains low? Trouble converting? How can I better convert?

&#x200B;

Will continuing to elevate my thyroid meds doses, as suggested by my doctor, help some of my markers that are low? Or, should I be looking at other options/treatments?

&#x200B;

Any input is greatly appreciated! Forums like this have been very helpful in slowly getting back to where I was before I had my thyroid removed.

320,Question about the relationship between prolactin and testosterone.,"I'm having some hormonal issues and hope that someone can give me some insight. I'm a 32yo female, 5""7, 125, caucasian (US).

​

For the last couple of months I've had some atypical cystic acne beneath my jawline as well as thinning hair. Recently, my period was nearly a week late. As pregnancy is not a possibility, I set up an appointment with my women's health provider. I told her I was concerned about PCOS, as the unusually late period and atypical acne had me concerned. As I am not overweight, and do not have painful periods, the provider doubted PCOS. She ordered labs for estrogen and testosterone as a precaution, but told me it is unlikely that the labs will be abnormal.

​

The estrogen came back fine, but the testosterone was very high (she did not give me a figure). She asked if I had been using any testosterone, I told her no, and she ordered a more complete workup for PCOS. Next week I will go do those labs. She noted that she will not be seeing me, that a doctor will review the results with me. While she is a new grad/ CNM, I don't understand why another provider would review the results with me. This makes me nervous.

​

I do not have a history of any reproductive issues. I have had a very healthy pregnancy and delivery in the past. With that being said, I experienced dysphoric milk ejection reflex (DMER) for about two years when I breastfed my child. Further, sometimes I experience that same ""wave of doom"" feeling when my partner is touching my breasts in an intimate context. For these reasons I worry that I may have a high level of prolactin too.

​

For those of you that are familiar with the endocrine system, **could high testosterone be related to high prolactin**? As I work in research, I have reviewed some journal articles that denote a relationship. With that being said, there is a fair amount of field-specific language that I do not feel qualified to interpret accurately.

​

I do not smoke, use recreational drugs, or any medications. I drink about 2 drinks per week. The only current medical history I have is slightly low B12 and Vitamin D, for which I have been supplementing with sublingual B12 and a multivitamin for Vit D. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I want to be informed when I consult with the new provider. We're living in an age of WebMD and I find that it's challenging sometimes to get a new provider to take unusual concerns seriously because they're used to people jumping to conclusions.

321,Life is hell after one year of hydrocortisone. Advice needed,"Age 30

Male


Took hydrocortisone for one year because of a misdiagnose

Since then I've been unable to exercise or do anything that requires strength. Lifting boxes, cleaning my house, running, dancing. -> I feel weak and weird in my head after ten minutes. If I continue with my activities I will feel extremely bad, faint, weak two days after. There is always a normal day between the activity and the consequences. On the second day, I will walk like an 80 year old and hardly have energy/strength at all. The next day I'm normal again. I also startle very easy and get dizzy when I see blood or needles. Not normal for me. I never feel good anymore but it's 'okay' as long as I don't exercise or clean or something like that. Some kind of 'exercise intolerance'.


Did an ACTH stimulation test last year.

---------------------------------------
Cortisol

* 00:00 - 329 nmol/L
* 00:30 - 503 nmol/L
* 01:00 - 608 nmol/L

ACTH

* 00:00 - 49 pg/mL
* 00:30 - 35 pg/mL
* 1:00 - 16 pg/mL

A 100 % increase would be 658 nmol/L. My cortisol increased 85 %.

----------------------------------------

After the ACTH test, I felt normal that day. When I had to take cortisol for an allergic reaction once, I felt normal that day. Clearly, taking hydrocortisone for one year has messed with my hpa axis. Low ACTH? Yet my doctor looks at my cortisol values and is happy because they are within range... 
We did a blood test when I did nothing and one two days after I exercised.

----------------------------------------

* Morning: 303 nmol/L
* Morning after exercise, feeling like hell: 226 nmol/L
Doctor is happy because values are within range. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

----------------------------------------

Found another doctor, she suggested I try [Rehmannia Six](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rehmannia-glutinosa). First week I felt amazing, normal! Second week I got weak and nauseated. I stopped the Rehnammnia, I got scared of Addison. Since then my exercise intolerance is way worse. Second doctor is clueless. First doctor wants me to exercise more. o_O

My life is hell. I can't do anything of significance anymore, I feel trapped in my body. I can't walk long distances: No museum visits, no exploring a city, no going out with friends. I can't clean my house. I can't lift heavy boxes. I can't dance. Can't have sex. The list goes on and on. 
I can't do any of the things worth living for without paying a very heavy price, being really sick during and after. It's hell!

I take Eleuthero and licorice. It helps somewhat.
Taking hydrocortisone again is not an option.

Thanks :-) "
328,Doctor says my T3 and T4 don't matter?,"A few years ago I got sick and the doctor I saw at my campus health center decided to do a blood test. My results came back negative for what they were looking for, but she said my thyroid levels were off. So I went back every few months to get my blood tested and after two years I fell off the wagon and stopped going. I recently decided to look back into the whole thyroid thing. A few days ago I established myself at a new PCP (Mayo clinic family care, so the doctors are supposed to be good) and discussed my concerns with her. She told me that T3 and T4 are totally irrelevant and only my TSH levels matter. I wanted to see what others had to say on this? My thyroid is enlarged and she put an order in for an ultrasound which I am getting tomorrow. I'm putting a picture of some of my previous blood work results on here as well. 

Based on my online research this could be indicative of hypothyroidism, however my new PCP disagrees completely. Some symptoms I have that I have seen mentioned online are: fatigue (chronic), enlarged thyroid, lethargy, cold hands and feet, irritability, depression, sexual dysfunction, and irregular periods.

I'm just trying to figure out if I should try and see an endocrinologist or not. My PCP doesn't seem likely to give me a referral, so I want to be proactive about this if need be. If anyone can interpret these lab results for me and has any advice, I would really appreciate it.

The report said my androstenedione is abnormal as the normal range is up to 5.5, so it's slightly high. But it gives the reference range for free testosterone as up to 1.5 for females, so I guess I have normal free T. Has anyone here ever encountered a case of moderate/low T and high androstenedione, does it mean anything in particular? I've just been advised to have a test for thyroid and prolactin at some point.

24 Years old, 175 Lbs, 5' 9.5, Smoker (On and off for about 9 years but more so off recently but I picked it back up). VERY VERY VERY Stressed out ALWAYS.

I went to the doctor recently for the first time in very very long. I haven't actively gone to the doctors since I was in grade school before this aside from the few small interactions with doctors in the Army. I finally decided to go to the doctor because I was freaking tired of my ED, breast enlargement (Although it's difficult to see at first because they look like regular pecks but they are definitely way more fatty than before and sensitive), my random weight gain and my ZERO sexual interest and libido.

Four years ago after I had to decide to take my father off life support after he suffered severe cerebral hypoxia, that same night when I got home after he had passed, my nipples were in extreme pain. The cold hurt me to the point of almost crying. They also bled from the nipple as well but I never really thought much of it because it never happened again.

Stress is a constant in my life, I can not write out how shit my life always is. There is not a word for how unfortunate my life has been but I'm lucky enough to have extremely good compartmentalization skills and don't let it get to me too much but physically it definitely takes a toll. 

I have been experiencing erection issues since I was 15 and just can barely stay hard enough for penetration. I have lost about 1"" - 2"" erect now that I'm older. I have been in a relationship for 4 years and at first I was really into sex but now, kissing does nothing to me, I do not enjoy it anyways and sex is like a chore, not because I am not into it, I just physically feel nothing. I have insomnia, I have memory issues (Which I heard can be a result of these things but my memory has been bad ever since I was knocked out when I hit a deer on my motorcycle at high speeds, although I never had my brain checked). I have no energy, I have no motivation, although I do my best to push myself, and I gained 30 lbs since Feb 2017.

When my doctor sent me for a blood test, my levels came back as follows.

Total T : 143 ng/dL

Free T : 32ng/dL

I don't recall my thyroid levels but the doctor exaggerated that it was EXTREMELYYYY LOW. He ended up immediately consulting a Endo and they recommended some more tests.

I will try to keep this as neat as possible but here are the results I received.

I have a medical condition made worse by specific hormone levels (I always flare bad around the time my period should be). It goes into remission for years sometimes but just about every spring it flares up for one week at least.. and some years it lasts longer.. some years nothing happens and I'm a normal human being.

335,"Low T, diabetes and hypothyroidism. Should I be alarmed?","So I was diagnosed with diabetes (perhaps pre-diabetic - memory is hazy) in 2011. Immediately started metformin and was also eventually diagnosed with low Testosterone and hypothyroidism that same year. Treated those with Axiron and levothyroxine, respectively. All three conditions responded well to treatment. 

Then I lost my insurance when I switched jobs in 2014, and due to ignorance and laziness, all three conditions went untreated until January of this year. I’ve now been “re-diagnosed” with all three issues, again. T levels are just north of 200, A1C is just over 7.4 (I think) and my thyroid is doing fine with the medicine. 

My doctor has set up an appointment with an endocrinologist because “there’s just so much going on with my endocrine system,” and I need a specialist’s expertise. I have a vague understanding of how the three issues are related, but I’d like a better understanding if one or a few of you could offer some insight. 

Most importantly, should I be seriously concerned? Should I expect grave news when I see the specialist or will it just be more acute treatment of these conditions and how they’re related?

336,Hormone therapy,"I was recently told about a therapy where after looking at your hormone results from blood tests and a spit test, a learned person can draw some conclusions about where you are failing hormone wise. For example, all your blood work comes back in normal ranges but a hormone therapist(?- not necessarily a genetist) Can review the results and may be able to figure out a pattern as to why X is happening then recommend a plan to you and your GP. 

I'm skeptical about this but I don't have any evidence one way or the other. Please let me know your thoughts."

338,What Could Be Causing My Hypogonadism?,"Hi, everyone. I’m 40 years old. My testosterone has been no higher than 330 with normal prolactin, shbg, fsh for the last 5 years. My lh was slightly high a few times. When it was first diagnosed I was 35 and 5’ 9"" 220 lbs. I got as high as 230 lbs. before I got serious about trying to regain my health and testosterone levels. I started counting calories and lifting weights 1 year ago. Today I weigh 185 and have some improved muscle tone but still struggle with some belly fat. I started Clomid around a year ago as well. This got my testosterone to 500 or so. Estradiol stayed in the normal range.

I went off of it the last 3 months at my doctor’s suggestion to see if I could produce on my own. This morning I found out my level is 99. I assume I have primary hypogonadism. What I don’t understand is I don’t fit any of the criteria for the causes of primary hypo. Any ideas on what could be the cause? I’ve been tested for the usual things such as hemochromatosis, Never had any known infections such as mumps. No physical injury. Negative for HIV, etc. I did have an inguinal hernia repaired 3 years ago, however. I developed secondary sexually characteristics normally and my testosterone came back at 750 in my mid 20s. Is there such a thing as idiopathic primary hypo where ther is just no known reason? I will be going back to my urologist in 2 weeks to start test and possibly hcg to maintain fertility."

342,Question about Estrogen and Progesterone levels in a monthly cycle.,"Ok so this is a ELI5 Question and may sound stupid.
I've been wondering why PMS or PMDD is blamed on low progesterone levels? During a cycle when Estrogen starts to rise, I feel great. I've also read that Estrogen is related to serotonin. So it's happy days right up until progesterone comes to town. What happens at this point? Does Estrogen disappear completely? It certainly feels like it as at this stage libido goes down and depression hits and extreme anger can turn up for no good reason. I don't understand! Is it the lack of Estrogen at this stage or the presence of progesterone causing these symptoms? Normally PMS or PMDD are blamed on the lack of progesterone but why? What affect does progesterone or the lack of it have on serotonin and mood? Why isn't the lack of Estrogen at this point ever get mentioned? Why, at the beginning and middle of a cycle when progesterone is not present, do I feel fine? 
I am not looking for a diagnosis, I am just genuinely curios as to what effects Estrogen and progesterone have on serotonin. 
TL/DR 
If Estrogen is present most of the month without progesterone and producing pleasant symptoms, why is PMS/PMDD blamed on lack of progesterone rather than lack of Estrogen?

346,Here we go again.,"Ok, here we go again it seems. Been out walking 20km for two days in the heat, then going to concerts and partying. Things just started to get wrong: I feel my electrolytes are completely out of whack again. I can't stay off the toilet, my heartrate is fairly slow and I just felt terribly nauseous and had some abdominal pain until I ate some salt. Now I feel like I'm somewhat drunk (I never drink, btw).

Emergency services basically fobbed me off with that a consultant will call me at an uncertain time. 

edit: I did see a paramedic last night. He was most concerned my by low resting heartrate, which is still about 10bpm lower than normal (45-48) and a lower bloodpressure. Had the choice of going to hospital for observation (would not have seen a specialist or gotten extensive blood testing) or stay at home. Going would have been useless as I know from experience as it doesn't speed up finally being referred to a specialist. Again slightly nauseous, feet feel partially numb from small toe towards heel (that's magnesium), and I'm about 2kg lighter than I was last night. Went for a pee I don't know how often last night."

348,Electrolyte wasting.,"Dear all,

For the past 5 years I've been trying to find out what's wrong with me. Well, much longer than that really. I slowly have the feeling that all these problems somehow relate to losing electrolytes and heaps of fluid. Why? No idea. 

If I do sport I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with rather bad palpitations. If I continue working out I might wake up with a) shortness of breath that lasts several weeks but usually gets better after breakfast and b) peeing like crazy. After 5 years of trial and error I now found out that eating electrolytes after the workout, Mg, K and NaCl seems to prevent this. 

I have been thirsty for the past 5 years! Unstillable. Drinking 6 litres per day and still thirsty. This stopped since I upped my salt intake all of a sudden.

I also have problems for as long as I can think with what feels like extremely low blood sugar. I now know that not eating sugar makes me feel better, but eating salt. If I feel it coming I eat salt and am fine a while later again instead of feeling weak and confused for a few days.

Still, every now and then I seem to be losing a lot of waterweight all of a sudden and then I feel that my electrolytes are out of whack again, especially Mg and K. I have to pee every night anyway even if I don't drink anything for a few hours before going to bed. Just doing a bit of sport also leaves me symptomatic for at least low Mg and K. I'm careful with K, but with Mg I cannot get it up enough with supplements to not get symptomatic after just a short walk in the summer. 

No idea for how long this is ongoing. I've had periods of enormous salt cravings since earliest childhood, apparently periods of poor development, seizures, absentness, always poor at sport, muscle problems. Was born too late and fairly big. Apparently inhaled fluids during birth and nearly suffocated. Had muscle problems and seizures right after birth and spent the next two weeks in a neonatal unit after transport per helicopter. Also since earliest childhood had blood pooling in my legs when running, which results in light-headedness and shortness of breath. 

Blood tests: every electrolyte ever tested was low at some point apart from sodium, oddly. But I get symptomatic before I even get to the lower reference value. That is true for many blood tests. If my ferritin drops below 30 I start to feel weak and as if the air lacks oxygen, and iron binding capacity starts shooting up. Had one incident where IBC was twice the upper reference value at Ferritin of 22. Magnesium seems to be low normal to 0.63 (Once tried to get it lower, no success. at 0.63 I feel miserable; every movement a cramp, numb feet, muscles twitching constantly), Albumin always low. 

I kind of feel this might be a problem related to kidneys? Hormones? I don't know. It's so odd that I all of a sudden start to pee like crazy, and flush out a lot of electrolytes along the way and that I can't get them up enough to not be symptomatic when I just sweat a bit. Or that I all of a sudden need to eat salt, otherwise I feel miserable for several days. "

They told me my pituitary was good and not to worry about that. then to come back in 6 weeks. 

I got busy in that period with college and didnt really realize that the thyroid issues were a big deal and didn't make my appointment and ran out of levothyroxine. After a few Weeks without it they did another TSH test only.

Today I went back to see her, and she told me that I am not taking my medicine properly and that I must be skipping days then doubling up on other days. I have never done this, and have not missed a single day of taking my medicine. Don't really know what to do if my doctor doesn't believe me, and assumes that I am just lying to her.. She took more labs today that haven't come back yet, but i'm expecting them to be similar to the last 2 because I haven't changed anything. Shes Testing my testosterone again and said she's going to do a brain scan if it comes back low... She doesn't really explain what is going on, she speaks as little as possible. I see her for maybe 2 minutes every 6 weeks. Can anyone shed a professional opinion as to what is going on? Ive got some major anxiety over this. I'm only 22 years old,, and I feel like I must be dying... "
350,Help with blood test results (Cortisol),"Hey guys, I’ve had blood work done to try and get to the bottom of some health issues I’ve been having. Anyway, I’m still waiting for the dr to get back to me but my levels were 39.63 ug/dL. It seems out of the normal range but what does it mean? (Female, 26, 5’1”, 100lbs)"
351,Question about testosterone and skin reaction,"I'm a 35 year old male. I'm fully developed as an adult sexually, however I look incredibly young for my age. My younger brother for example is 4 years younger than me, however looks 5 years older. He can grow a full beard whereas I can only  grow a little bit of facial hair. He's balding and I have a full head of hair (thank god!). I've had oily skin and problems with pimples since I was 15 and I've developed Rosacea over the past 2 years, likely due to thin skin. My brother has none of these issues. I've had my testosterone levels checked and they come in the normal range, however they barely scrape by the bottom of the normal range. I have a couple questions, could I be going through some form of very delayed puberty? How is it possible that I have oily skin when my testosterone levels are on the very low end of normal? I've thought maybe i'm just very sensitive to androgens, but if that were the case, I assume I would be balding like my brother. I'm struggling to understand why my brother and I could be so different in our development paths given we have the same genetics ?"
352,Are there any options to even out my hormonal cycle?,"I have always been sensitive to hormones. I get bad PMS, and at various points during my cycle i experience fatigue, bloating etc.

I hadnt had a period in about 3 years, and now that I do again, I remember how awful it was. I am just tired so so often. I used to nap in the afternoon... Now I have a toddler and I can't do that. I have a few good days a month but otherwise there's always soemthing. A couple of days of bloating, a few days of cramps and bleeding, lots of tiredness, some emotional craziness, heavy legs for a couple of days.

As a teenager I didn't have periods due to amenorrhea athletica. After high school I gained some weight, got my period again, and started having other issues. A probable but not proven diagnosis of celiac has led to a gluten free diet, which has solved a lot of my health problems including most fatigue.

I get low blood sugar quickly. When I'm on the pill, I don't. 

I've tried various combined contraceptive pills. They have all been horrific. Weight gain despite a lower appetite, massive fatigue, lowered aerobic capacity and athletic performance, emotional instability, acne, hair growth, migraines that landed me in hospital.

I lost a lot of weight whilst traveling, and ended up not having my period for a long time. I felt so good. I was so consistent, my energy didn't vary from day to day, I didn't have mood swings, I didn't have headaches. Then i wanted to get pregnant and needed some assistance. Part of the treatment was taking progesterone suppositories at a low dose to induce a period so that I could start fsh. Even those few days of progesterone had a huge effect. At first they did make me feel chilled and calm, but after the first 2 days the fatigue, nausea and headaches started. I took half the dose for half the time and it still worked to induce a period.

Pregnancy was amazing. My mood was more stable than it's ever been, my skin was clear, everything was great. The first 3 months of exclusive breast feeding were wonderful. At 3 months old we had to supplement my daughter with formula, and over the course of the next year as she breast fed less (including due to starting solids), I started experiencing really bad post partum depression and anxiety symptoms. I weaned at 17 months and the vast majority of those symptoms went away. I was a good 3kg underweight whilst breast feeding, even at the end when she was just having one feed a day. and just didn't seem able to gain weight.

As soon as I weaned, I put on 3kg without trying and got my period. Now I'm back to a Rollercoaster each month, feeling tired on so many days of the month, having a few days of being out of action due to symptoms each month.

Whenever I've had my thyroid tested, it's been normal. This was however always during a time of no period, pregnancy or breastfeeding. I don't have a baseline for what my 'normal' is. 

I'm so sick of it. I just want soemthing to even my hormones out. Is there anything out there for me?
"
353,HELP!Cushing's or Is it Anorexia causing my issues?,"Hi all! I would like to have any insight on what might be going on with me as my doctors and endocrinologist are stumped at the moment about it.

For the past few months I had vague general symptoms like fatigue and unusual acne, cloudy brain, lower blood pressure, inability to calm down etc. Although at the time these symptoms weren't unbearable and didn't seem very concerning so I just left it and thought they'd resolve themselves. But I was wrong and things got increasingly rapidly worse with new symptoms and where it has interrupted my daily life. These symptoms include, even lower blood pressure, more acne, inability to sleep properly (it's like my body clock is back to front, I'm so exhausted in the mornings and tired but feeling wired at night), frequent heart palpitations, weak and aching muscles, bouts of on and off nausea, headaches, dehydration no matter how much water I drink, frequent urination, slow unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue (it's hard to do much of anything), low libido, depression, irritable, feeling on edge all of the time, bloating in the stomach constantly, recent increase in hunger, cloudy brain and inability to think properly, memory loss, reduced immune function.
Because of all this I decided to go to the doctor and he got a blood test done on my general chemistry, glucose, TSH level, insulin, FSH, LH, Prolactin, Oestradiol, ACTH, Iron, Urine test and cortisol. This blood test was all done fasted and in the morning (8.44AM)
The doctor told me everything was fine besides I have very high cortisol levels - 995nmol/L 
Because of the high cortisol levels he then got me to do a dexamethasone suppression test in which I took the tablet at 11.10pm and got my blood test done at 8.30AM the next morning. The results from the dexamethasone test came back extremely high also with 871nmol/L and my range SHOULD have been < 50nmol/L. 

This left my doctor to get me to see an endocrinologist enquiring if I had Cushing's syndrome or not. With the results my endocrinologist did not know what to make of them and requested to do more blood tests and a late night saliva cortisol test which I am waiting on the results for. 

I have a theory on what is going on with me but am not entirely sure if its a possibility. 
For some important background: 
Last year I got diagnosed with anorexia. The anorexia developed quite rapidly so I went from decreasing my calories and losing weight quite quickly. At my worst of the anorexia I would eat about 80 - 200 calories a day, exercise it off by brisk walking and would lose a kilogram a week by doing so. My body reacted as you would expect in an anorexic person, I was so cold all the time and my temperature had dropped, my physical hunger cues were gone but I was so preoccupied thinking about food, I was very weak and my muscles would ache, I couldn't sleep properly, my hair would fall out, loss of libido and lack of pubic hair growth, depressed and irritable, very low blood pressure and pulse, dizziness and feeling faint, extreme fatigue, dry skin and constipation. 
After months of suffering with the anorexia and getting to 40kg at 5""1 (about 4 1/2 - 5 kg underweight), I went into recovery. I did an outpatient recovery treatment in which my family took over my eating (I couldn't feed myself, choose my foods or know the nutrition information of what I was eating) and had to eat 5-6 meals a day, weighed every week (expected to gain a kilogram every week by my treatment team) and frequent doctor visits to see how my body was improving. In recovery my body seemed to bounce back quite quickly. My temperature stabilised within a week of referring and my blood pressure + pulse started raising and continued to get in a healthy range, my energy started coming back within a few days of refeeding, my libido started coming back within a week as well as my hunger cues, ability to sleep again and so on. 
My body seemed to physically recover greatly and improve. I was healthy again even before reaching the ""healthy weight range"" on the BMI chart. I was doing well for months (reached a healthy weight of 45-46kg) until I started struggling with my depression again, which made me start relapsing into anorexia again, I also started exercising and developed an exercise addiction. When relapsing, I didn't get to an as low point of eating 80 - 200 calories a day, I just began skipping more meals and exercising everything off. I would eat under 1000 calories one day and exercise, then if I ate more calories I would compensate by skipping more meals or exercising more. This resulted in me feeling very fatigued and depressed and losing the weight I had gained in recovery. 
I eventually got sick from low iron and couldn't have the energy to do anything anymore let along get enough oxygen, this resulted in me forced to stop exercising. The stopping of exercising made me freak out and restrict my intake more with bouts of binges from restricting my intake. I got to a new lower weight than ever before at 38.7kg. 
After I got my iron up, I started feeling better energy wise and felt capable of exercising again. I decided that as soon as I start exercising I should increase my calories again slowly and slowly gain back the weight that I had lost. I was doing this and managed to increase my calories by 500 - 600 more and gaining a kilogram in about a month and a half. Although despite this increase in calories and weight gain, I was still over exercising my body a ton and then became very ill from whatever is going on now. I haven't been able to exercise at all in the past month besides walking and have stuck to eating around 1550 calories a day. 

I am wondering if it is possible that the extremely high cortisol levels are a result of what I have put my body through? And if increasing calories and trying to gain weight will help lower the cortisol and get things back to normal? 
Even though my lab results have come back in normal ranges (besides the cortisol), I find it interesting that a lot of the results are the same or almost similar results as a blood test I had done when I was very sick from the anorexia (eating the 80 - 200 calories a day), whereas a blood test I had done when I was in recovery and felt healthy and was healthy were different, it is almost like my body thinks it's still in the same starvation state as it was last year even though I am feeding it a lot more now. 
I would love to hear anyone's thoughts on this matter, would be greatly appreciated if anyone has any ideas on what's going on. 
Thank you in advance for anyone who took the time out to read this.

Cardiovascular: started having symptoms of hypertension. Blurred vision, pounding headache, ect. Went to the doctor was diagnosed with  mild hypertension but the problem was mainly diastolic.  It was staying in the 90s, systolic 110-125. 
My resting pulse was stay 110-130. Doctor thought I was odd bc I have no familial history and never had issues with ether prior. In fact I was more prone to low bp.  So bloodwork was drawn (CBC, Metabolic Panel, Thyroid Panel, Hormone Panel)

Results all three times over a year period have came back everytime with everything within normal limits  except:
T3 uptake is always low: 18 with reference being 24-39. All other thyroid within normal range.  

Estradiol <5.0 which puts me in post menopausal range (I’ve abnormal periods, mother went thru menopause in late 50s)
FSH: 0.3
LH: 0.1.  Neither of these are even in the reference range of any reproductive phase. 
Testosterone within normal limits. 
I had a child 3 years ago and began experiencing menopausal type symptoms about 6 months after.      
I have an apt with an endocrinologist but they cannot see me for another 4 months. 

Recent head CT: unremarkable
Recent thyroid ultrasound: unremarkable

Any ideas???

355,Hormonal issues: blood tests. End of our rope.,"crossposted on /r/askdocs, didn't get any reply. 

Writing on behalf of my fiancée, with her permission.

* Age: 22 yo
* Sex: F
* Height: 163cm
* Weight: 60kg
* Race: Caucasian
* Duration of complaint: since first period (13 yo)
* Location: South Europe.
* Any existing relevant medical issues: cyclothymia (just diagnosed), tilted uterus, allergies
* Current medications: pregabalin, escitalopram - started about six months ago


She's always had **irregular, extremely painful periods**:

* sometimes they skip months (there's no pattern),
* usually are late by one/two weeks,
* 1 out of 2, maybe more, cause her debilitating pain for the first two days, for which she takes either ketoprofen or arcoxia,
* they last for about a week


I've witnessed them, and saw how painful they are. She's the toughest person I know, and sometimes they make her *cry*.

She recently underwent a vaginal ultrasonography, which didn't reveal anything abnormal, but confirmed the tilted uterus - same as her mom.

The gynecologist prescribed her folic acid for three months, to take every other day, which worked to regularize her periods for as long as she took it, but didn't have any lasting effect after she stopped. Her folate levels were normal.

Currently, her period has skipped this month.

Clearly, she can't go on like this any longer, but she doesn't have the means for a specialist visit right now, and her GP is kind of useless. Our question is: what blood work would you recommend? What hormones levels should she check?

I know these kind of questions are hard to answer and your first impulse would be to recommend her to see a doctor, but those available for free didn't have any answers for her, besides the one with folic acid, and if we had any other way, we wouldn't be asking on Reddit. You guys are our last resort.

So, what kind of blood test (usually the cheapest option out there) would be useful to start understanding the situation?

Thank you!

358,Can the effects of precocious puberty continue affecting you while older?,"When I was young, I had precocious puberty, and I took a monthly injection to slow down my hormonal growth until I could catch up. I started puberty somewhere between 7 and 9 years earlier than expected, but once I was done with the injections, my family and doctors had assumed the problem was fixed. 

I'm an adult now, just into my 30s, and finally at the age where I'd expect the thyroid issues that run in both sides of my family to begin. However, mine started 7 or 8 years ago and have since been dealt with. This matching timeline makes me wonder if there still might be an issue with my endocrine system being this many years ahead of where it should be and what consequences that could have as I age. I've asked a couple of endocrinologists towards the start of my thyroid problems if the early onset could be caused by my childhood problems as well, and I've gotten answers ranging from ""absolutely not"" to ""hm, I suppose that's possible.""

I plan on letting my current doctor know during my next appointment and blood draws in a couple of months, but I'm hoping for some more information so I can address it in a knowledgeable manner and ask meaningful questions. If it is a possibility, what age- and hormone-related problems might I run into earlier than expected (beyond menopause and typical women's reproductive issues)? Is there anything I should keep an eye out for that a doctor might not be checking?"

My endo is on leave or I'd directly ask her this question:  

During my last appointment, where my A1C results were revealed, she asked ""any finger numbness?"" and I didn't think anything about it.  I said ""no"" ... and I should have said ""why?""

A few weeks later I realized that I have slightly noticeable numbness on my left hand in the middle three fingers.  It has persisted for 2-3 weeks now.  Right hand is fine, toes are fine.

360,familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (supposedly benign),"Ive been diagnosed with this rare condition (loss of function of the calcium sensing receptors) which causes my ionized calcium levels to be consistently elevated... on fasting the levels range from 1.34 to 1.39 mmol. PTH levels are normal and urine calcium is very low while creatinine levels are high (urine).

Anyway my question; why is that hypercalcemia in ANY other circumstance is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular health (think arterial calcification) but every where I've read on this condition (and even been told by my endocrinologist) says that FHH doesn't cause problems or complications...well it does supposedly but that is said to be ""rare"". Why is this genetic form of hypercalcemia considered harmless while other forms are dangerous to overall health? 

I spoke a little about this with my cardiologist (whos very impressive in his knowledge) and he said its generally not a problem if you dont have other risk factors such as diabetes, high alcohol consumption, low fitness/inactivity levels, high blood pressure etc. Based on what I've read, in primary hyperparathyroidism and kidney disease at least, the hypercalcemia causes problems mainly because the excess PTH causes dysfunction on the vascular walls. But I've also read that calcium supplementation can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

All answers are appreciated. "

362,IF the cause of Hashimoto's is E. gallinarum...,"This recent paper out of Yale (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1156.full) suggests that autoimmune diseases can be caused by a gut bacteria – specifically E. gallinarum – escaping the gut and hiding out in organs where it shouldn't be. 

Now, obviously autoimmune diseases have strong heredity, but the heredity could be that some people are genetically predisposed to having the E. gallinarum escape, couldn't it?

So here is my question: **IF** Hashimoto's is caused by E. gallinarum hiding out in the thyroid, would changing the gut flora of a person with Hashimoto's make any difference? Or is it already too late? i.e. the bacteria has already escaped and nestled in the thyroid?

In the study I've linked above, the researchers treated the mice with vancomycin or an E. gallinarum vaccine. 

Getting a doctor to prescribe vancomycin on the off chance it helps a patient with Hashimoto's before clinical trials have been conducted will be nigh on impossible. And I don't think an E. gallinarum vaccine for humans even exists. 

So is there any possibility – **IF** Hashimoto's is caused by E. gallinarum hiding out in the thyroid – that a probiotic (or even a faecal transfer?) could help to lessen symptoms? "

364,Low Testosterone a Sign of Hypothyroidism?,"I don't have a diagnosis of Hypothyroidism, my TSH has always been around 1, but I've had all the symptoms for years. As an experiment I ordered natural dessicated thyroid off the internet. I noticed an improvement in my symptoms pretty quickly. About 8 months later I went in for my yearly physical and my TSH was .01, My GP kinda freaked out a bit and insisted I stop taking the thyroid pills, so I did and all my symptoms returned. 

6 months later I still felt lousy so the GP tested more hormones. LH & FSH normal, Serum Testosterone was below normal at 190, TSH was 2.9 and Free T4 was at the bottom of the range. I made an  appointment with an Endo but the soonest was 3 months. Wanting to feel better I started taking half my previous dose of NDT again. 

3 months later when I saw the Endo my TSH was just above 1, my serum testosterone was almost 600 and my Free T4 was still close to the bottom of the range. Since everything was normal he couldn't do anything. The whole appointment was about five minutes long.

I've had high gluclose hovering below and above the pre-diabetes range for 10 years, despite eating healthy and exercising daily.  My doctor says he thinks it's probably related to the autoimmune component.  I am severely fatigued all the time despite taking levo and my TSH numbers being fine.  Is it possible the fatigue is related to the autoimmune element, which as mentioned isn't being treated?

Is there anywhere I can monitor developments and research on the autoimmune component of hypothyroidism?"

373,Elevated growth hormone,"I’m a 28 year old female that has been treated off and on for the last 6 years for subclinical hypothyroidism. Early in my diagnosis I had an MRI done which found a 3mm microadenoma on my pituitary gland, my blood work confirmed it was inactive. I’m hoping to get pregnant with my third child soon (have had no fertility issues), and my doctors want to redo the MRI to see if anything has changed. 

In the blood work leading up to the MRI it was indicated that my growth hormone is elevated. This has my endocrinologist all in a tizzy and throwing around words like acromegaly. I have no physical symptoms of that, but am growing increasingly distressed by the possibility.  I spoke to my doctor yesterday morning and went in to have a glucose test in the afternoon to recheck the growth hormone levels. I am also doing a 24 urine collection to check cortisol levels.

Are there any other reasons for my growth hormone to be elevated (negative pregnancy test)? Has anyone else been through this? "
374,Two big problems; none the wiser,"I have two big problems for many years now.

1) out of nowhere I suddenly get weak, confused, brains absent, tunnel vision, just stare into nothingness, paleness, low blood pressure, and I get the munchies. I eat everything within reach (bread, fruit, veggies, candy, yogurt) but only feel better at dinner. Problem comes back next mornings. I know by now that the munchies are related to salt craving: if I eat salt I nearly immediately feel better and problem doesn't come back.

GP finally look some action and tested morning cortisol, which was apparently normal (still need to discuss) while I was right on the onset of another such flareup. Sometimes I can trigger a flareup by being very active the day before (scrambling up steep hill in morning with low blood pressure and strength training in evening), but usually there's no trigger.

b) suddenly I pee out a lot of fluid. Normally my (water) weight goes up from Tuesday to Saturday morning by 400-600gr due to having an of office job. Last week my morning weight went down by 100gr per day over 4 days. Result (as ever): very bad orthostatic hypotension, very lightheaded when walking up stairs or mild inclines, quickly winded, sometimes abdominal pain but probably due to being winded so easily, working out feels like my airways have been treated with sandpaper and I cough constantly for hours afterwards, constipated because my feces are so dry and hard, extreme thirst, tiredness, low electrolyte symptoms. Sometimes I wake up with shortness of breath and my bladder fills up rapidly a few times the same night. Mild flareups last about 1-2 weeks, more severe ones about 6 weeks. Salt doesn't prevent this but temporarily help against thirst, constipation and dry lungs. If shortness of breath is present then worst at night. No actual trigger known, but taking a single diamox ones caused the same. 

Both a) and b) never occur together. a) has been present for at least 25 years (I'm 44) and I wonder if not much longer. I've been having periodic salt cravings since earliest childhood and my parents took me to a neurologist at 10 due to 'absences'. Might just have been day dreaming though. b) has been present for many years, though the acute manifestation only for four years. 

Morning cortisol apparently normal. Potassium tends to be low, Albumin usually 29-34 (37-x), sodium always middle of range, all other electrolytes normal low to below lower reference range. Liver and kidney values normal. Hashimotos (on levothyroxine) but fairly unstable, B12 deficiency self-treated with shots every 3 weeks with ok from GP as she can only give a shot every 2-3 months.

If none of those problems are present I feel completely normal apart from lowish orthostatic bloodpressure.

Any suggestions? I cannot simply go to an endo due to living in the UK. "
375,How quickly will using testosterone cream show up on labwork?,"My endo are trying to tweak my crazy hormones. I started on Testosterone cream today and I'm wondering what the ideal amount of time is for me to get my labwork done to see if this is the right dose of T cream or if we need to adjust it. 

My endo says she thinks 6 to 8 weeks but she's a little unfamiliar with using Testosterone cream (I primarily see her for my type 1 diabetes and Addison's disease)  so I figured I would ask here as well!"
376,Can anyone tell me anything about the side effects or interactions of antipsychotics and thyroid meds? I think something has gone wrong....,
377,Is it worth getting another blood test based on my previous blood results?,"I'm having some pretty annoying symptoms that seem consistent with hypothyroid. My doc says my thyroid levels are fine and healthy. It has been over the range a couple of times but it was only by a marginal amount. I do feel really off, but at this point I don't want a return trip to the doctor if it is going to be a waste of time and hypothyroid symptoms are so vague it's difficult to tell if I'm just being oversensitive. 

A bit of background: I have Celiac disease diagnosed with a blood test and biopsy (subtotal villous atrophy). I have been diagnosed for about five years now and am on a strict diet so I'm pretty confident the symptoms aren't a result of Celiac.

I have had three thyroid blood tests done from 2012-2016 but the doctors didn't seem too concerned with my results and other blood results showed nothing remarkable.

I know Celiac can increase the likelihood of other Autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's, but unfortunately, I can't just get the thyroid antibodies test done to rule it out as my doc says there is no way it will be ordered unless my TSH levels go well out of the range. 

I thought I would post and see if it's recommended/worth getting my TSH/Free T4 checked again based on my previous results? 

**Here are my lab results:** 

**2012:**

TSH: 3.6 (High), Units:MIu/L RANGE: 0.40-3.50

(Doc notes: Marginally high, recommending re-testing in 6-12 months)

Free T4: 15.2, UNITS:pmol/L, RANGE: 10.0-24.0

378,How likely is it that I perhaps have Hypothyroidism?,"Since early high school, I've felt nothing but constant fatigue and lethargy. I can sleep for 10 hours and still feel tired and like sleeping again after two hours of being awake. I have little physical energy to do very basic things, and I feel like often times my hands are shaking slightly without me even realizing it. 

I also have a lot of constipation, however ever since I've been drinking coffee for the last few years, it seems to have worked similar to a laxative. 

Coincidentally, and in addition to all of this, I recently have been noticing slight thinning around the left temple region of my hair. A few years ago, I began noticing that my hair had become ""finer"" and thinner, which might be another clue. I should note though, that while my two temples are both objectively receded and while my hairline isn't the greatest, I'm not sure if it would be enough to render my issue as a symptom to Male Pattern Baldness, simply because there are no people on either side of my family who are bald (in particular, my father or maternal grandfather; both retained their hair). 

Prior to even discovering what Hypothyroidism even was, I initially thought that I perhaps was suffering from MPB (but again, it is genetic), and after discovering what Hypothyroidism is, I feel like this potentially could be the cause of many of my issues. 

Please note, that many years ago a teacher had also noticed that I was constantly ""sluggish"" and abnormally tired, and suggested that I get my blood done because her relative was Anemic and had very similar symptoms and issues to me. I got my blood done for this, and I was not Anemic. I have never gotten my thyroids checked though.

I should also add that for the last two years, I have been sweating very severely even when it isn't particularly hot; whether it's on my back or legs. I soak my entire pants and shirts, even when it isn't remotely hot! My hands always manage to get severely sweaty too. I have also experienced slightly unusual weight loss (I know this because I have had to change the size of my pants three times to smaller waist sizes) within the last 2-3.5 years, despite nothing in my diet changing.

I'm told that my lab results are normal within the ranges, yet I am symptomatic on so many levels and struggling with day-to-day. I'm also trying to conceive and working with a reproductive specialist who also seems to think the thyroid isn't an issue or contributing to reproductive problems. Could I get some opinions on these lab results and how to present my case to the doctors? I sincerely feel that I need to be on a thyroid medication at the least.

387,Adrenalectomy,"Hi all,

Through the various urine tests, countless blood tests, two dexamethasone tests and finally a CT Scan we discovered a tumour on my left adrenal gland and I was diagnosed with Cushings! 

I wanted to know if anyone has any experience of an adrenalectomy and what I've to expect. I'm not so worried about the surgery because it's laparoscopic and the healing time isn't long, but I'm more concerned as my other adrenal is ""asleep"" and I'll now have no cortisol whatsoever and I'll have to take supplements until the other gland ""wakes up"". How should I expect to feel during this come down? From going from way too much cortisol to having none and mimicking it. Any help is appreciated!"
388,doctor prescribed me with trt. have doubts,hello so for soooo damn long time ive been feeling with low t symptoms and finally after several doctors i got injections. im 26 right now. the doctor who is finally willing to treat me said he doesnt believe in clomid much and the best way is injections. but heres the tricky part. he said once every 2 weeks and check up for next appointment is in 4 months. idk if this is wayyy to long for a next check up? i ask for once a week injection but he said no because t will overproduce and be a bad outcome. is once every 2 week enough? https://imgur.com/a/NMPuv heres what he prescribed me with. lastly he said if i dont use it for too long (before one year) or just stop it i can go back to natural production. should i keep seeking for help (dont know where else lol) https://imgur.com/a/v6O4L labs https://imgur.com/a/j5A7c

390,Question about thyroid levels results.,"Hi all!  I'm 28, female, about 20 lbs overweight.  Brief overview of the last year - intermittent fevers (low grade) with no identifiable cause, FATIGUE, joint pain, difficulty sleeping, weight gain despite consuming less than 1500 calories most days and light exercise a couple times a week.  Gastrointestinal troubles (gas, constipation, diarrhea).

I had some tests run by nurse practitioner and am awaiting referral appointments.  Got back these results for thyroid:

T4 free - measured @ 1.24 ng/dL, normal range given 0.89-1.76 ng/DL

TSH, HIGH-SENSITIVITY (TSH w/FT4 reflex) measured @ 0.279 uIU/mL, normal range given 0.550 - 4.780 uIU/mL  

T3 wasn't measured this time around, but was measured this last summer when I was having all the same symptoms, came back within the normal range.  Don't have that result available.

The nurse practitioner is suggesting medication to raise the TSH.  But from what I've read this is my pituitary gland function, and if your T3 and T4 levels are normal, your thyroid is okay.  What do you all think of this?  I'm not a medical professional, but she's also not an endocrinologist.  "
391,does all microadenoma needs surgery?,"hello guys. im having issues finding out why i have low testosterone.https://imgur.com/QHozVvs  https://fantasia777.imgur.com/all/  heres the thing, my tumor is not releasing prolactin https://fantasia777.imgur.com/all/, but my acth is a tiny high, but cortisol is normal https://fantasia777.imgur.com/all/. (someone told me here acth increased by panicking in the lab when injecting) so maybe my adenoma is not working? on the other hand, my lh is low, my tsh 3 is a the bottom end and my testosterone have been lowish for years now. maybe my tumor is damaging signals to send for testosterone? does that need surgery even the smallest? latest lab test https://imgur.com/a/uoOH2"

393,Anyone know much about Hashimoto's hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalitis?,"My daughter is hospitalized with psychotic symptoms (see below for specifics). Neuro doesn't want to get endocrinology involved even though she's diagnosed with Hashimoto's. Recent testing indicated very high antibodies (in the hundreds), low TSH and typical T4. I've read that high antibodies can be a concern for Hashimoto's encephalitis even when T4 and TSH are normal and asked that her antibodies be tested, but the neurologist isn't interested in testing her thyroid because her previous tests show:

December levels:

TSH - .02

T4 - 1.74

Tg antibodies - 153

Tpo antibodies - 348

After those results came in, doctor decreased her levothyroxine by 10 mcg and retested in January:

TSH - .22

T4 - 1.26

Antibodies were not retested.

SYMPTOMS:
* Urinary incontinence (2 weeks; home and school)
* obvious hallucinations accompanied by significant distress (two incidents on Friday at school and at least one at home earlier in the week that may have been a hallucination)
* trouble regulating her moods and her sleep (about 1 month; home and school)
* increasingly confused and disoriented (two weeks; home and school)
* regressing fine motor, gross motor, and speech (2-3 weeks; speech at home; motor skills and speech at school)
* vivid, horrifying dreams (about 1 month; home and school)
* increased aggression and defiance (mostly at school; 2 weeks)
huge breakout of acne on face and back (2 weeks)
* strong oral and body odor
* decreased daily living skills
* trouble swallowing
* generalized discomfort 
* headaches and neck pain

Could this be Hashimoto's encephalopathy or something else related to the thyroid? How insistent do I need to be that they retest ALL thyroid levels? Do I demand it be done today (neuro doesn't want to call him in on his day off)? Do I ask for a thyroid ultrasound? Should I insist endocrinology be contacted today, or is tomorrow okay? For now, I've told them I'm not leaving until this testing is done, but I want to make sure I'm not overreacting before I dig in my heals.

They've recommended antipsychotic meds for these symptoms, but since she's had only a handful of incidents... I really hesitate to put her on those heavy meds for something that just presented as a problem, especially if there could be physical reason behind it. "

395,High Anti-thyroglobulin...,"So a fertility clinic ran some tests for my wife a couple of years ago, and her anti-thyroglobulin came back at 357 IU/ml (range: 0-115).  
The fertility clinic didnt really say much about it. She was getting Prednisone during the IVF cycle and as far as they were concerned, that was it.  Anti-TPO was in range at <5IU/ml (range: 0-34)
No other thyroid tests were done at the time, her TSH was tested about a year later and it was in range at 1.35mIU/l (range: 0.55-4.78)  
  
She doesnt seem to have symptoms of Hashimoto’s or Grave’s, or any other thyroid problem, but we had a few failed IVFs, so this is something we want to investigate.

397,Pituitary microadenoma - what will this mean for me and my symptoms?,"*note: I am due to see my endocrinologist in 2 weeks to discuss this, but have a few questions I wanted to post here for the time being*.

I posted a while back about having excess hair growth. I am a female and in the past approx. 2 years I have been growing dark, black hairs in places like my neck and chest. My chest was most worrying; about 2 years ago there was maybe 2 or 3, I could pluck them out without problem. But now there are so many, and are beginning to cover more of my chest and breasts (and neck).

I've had many tests done. Several blood tests showed high cortisol 778, 799 nmol / L) but the 24hr urine test for cortisol was ""normal"" (that's all the info I got from my endocrinologist).

I had slightly high DHEA (11 umol / L).

Most importantly, I had high prolactin (1330 mIU/L, compared to last year which was only 338).

I had an MRI recently for my pituitary and the results showed ""pituitary microadenoma"", 6.9mm in size.

So I have some questions. Firstly, do you think this could likely be the cause of my hair growth? I am doubtful because it seems I am not experiencing any other symptoms usually associated with these tumours. 

What is likely the next step my endocrinologist will take? Will the tumour be removed?

Other information:

- I'm 21 years old female
- not taking any meds
- I do experience anxiety and depression, but not sure if this is related. Also, I do wear glasses (only for driving and seeing the board at uni), and have heard vision problems can result from such tumours. Is it possible that it's related? But I started wearing glasses a long time ago, when I was 14. Could it go that far back?"

399,"Advice needed- natural menstrual cycle too frequent, seeing an endocrinologist soon","Since I got my first period at age 12, my natural menstrual cycle has been every other week. Periods usually last 6-9 days. Light-average flow. I get a lot of symptoms before and during my period:

- acne
- severe mood swings: depression, anger, irritability, suicidality
- weight gain / bloating
- often debilitating nausea and general feeling of unease
- light cramps once in a while
- lower back pain
- headaches which last all day
- food cravings (especially sugar) and a hard time feeling full
- tender boobs (not very often)
- fatigue
- anemia while I was briefly vegetarian

I have tried out a series of BC pills over the course of several years (I'm currently in my late 20's), all of which either didn't regulate my period, made some symptoms worse, or only addressed some of the symptoms.

I have had an IUD for about 3 years. It was magical the first 2 and a half years. No periods, no side effects, no period related symptoms. Then after having surgery, taking Oxycodone for recovery, and getting off that drug, my period immediately started to come back. Over a few months, it stabilized back into the every-other-week rhythm, with all of the side effects (esp the mental health issues) back in full force. It's extremely disruptive to my life.

Ob/Gyn prescribed Camila which has reduced some of the side effects, but has not stemmed the flow or completely helped out with the mental health issues.

Primary care physician decided to send me to an endocrinologist, but my appt is still a few weeks away. PC said my low blood sugar might also be related to the hormonal issues.

Blood tests, PAP smears, and ultrasounds have always been normal. I am otherwise fairly healthy- good sleep, good food, exercise 4-6 times/week. Never been pregnant.  I can post my most recent blood work if that would be helpful, but my PCP said it was all normal.

So:

1.  What the fuck? Does anyone else have a natural cycle of every other week? Everything on the internet for too frequent periods doesn't seem to fit my situation because I have never had normal periods, I am not pre-menipausal, my flow is light, I don't have any STD's (last checked a few weeks ago), and I have not recently taken the Plan B pill. Am I the only one with this issue?!

2.  What are some things I should research before my appt with the endocrinologist? What should I ask her?

3.  Should I try to get in with any other doctor types? Any other resources I should be aware of?

Endometriosis and PCOS don't really seem to fit my symptoms.

I don't know what to do, and I am afraid that I will just be passed around from doctor to doctor for years before I figure out what's going on.

400,Hashimotos,"Just recently saw my endocrinologist for the first time and got diagnosed with hashimotos. Have to go for thyroid ultrasound in a couple weeks because my thyroid was enlarged. The GP that referred me increased my levothyroxine dose from 25 to 50 prior to my endocrinologist appointment and she decided to leave it alone and do blood work in a month. Since I've been on the higher dose I've been getting mild headache that last a really long time. Yesterday I had a severe migraine, but today I had the mild headache again. My apetite has been a little hit or miss as well. Had some occasional nausea and I tend to get pretty tired toward the end of the day. Is all this due to a side effect of the levothyroxine?"

 I am wondering if this is something I should consult my GP about.

On another note, my testosterone and free testosterone were normal but low (14.5 nmol/L, 310 pmol/L) - I am wondering if I can use this single sample to extrapolate what/where my testosterone levels are likely to be during the day and throughout my life. I am also wondering what the distribution is among the general population.

402,Cushing's Disease Help?!,
403,Parathyroid Hormone Elevated. Advice?,"Hello!

My doctor noticed that I had high calcium levels a few years back with no follow-up, he suspected issue with my parathyroid.

So he recently checked my PTH levels and they were elevated. He also checked my calcium and now it was normal. So he suspected that my vitamin D levels were low. The thing is that low D-vit, as far as I know, doesn't cause high calcium, or does it? I mean, isn't the whole reason for the parathyroid is to release calcium from the bone to balance the blood calcium levels? If the calcium is high would that not mean that calcium is getting stolen from my bones while I also get enough dietary calcium? Anyway, the thing is that I already take 55mcg/2000IU vitamin d3 during winter and 25mcg during summer since I'm not getting much dietary d-vit from my diet.

So he said that my vitamin D3 was fine but my D2 was low. And I don't understand how this is relevant? He advises me to get vitamin d2 supplement but doesn't this act just as d3 in the body just a less effective version of vitamin D for absorption? I never heard that D2 is essential if you get enough D3? Since both forms of vitamin D get converted into calcitriol I don't see how d2 would help?
Could it be that my body is having trouble absorbing the d3 I eat?

I told him this and he just said he doesn't know, that low d2 is common in vegetarians and that they won't do shit right now. 

Is it possible to display normal calcium levels even if you have primary hyperparathyroidism? I did read that the body may stop the absorption of vitamin D to reduce the dietary absorption of calcium and balance the levels of calcium in the blood. 
Maybe I'm not getting enough dietary calcium right now? But I don't want to take a calcium supplement if my body keeps taking calcium from the bones. That would mean a lot of calcium in the blood right?

What can I do now? Should I try to go with the d2 supplement?
Could my body have trouble absorbing dietary vitamin D?"

405,"Endo/kidney connection? (fluid loss, salt...)","Hello guys, wall of text ahead. Sorry.

I've been trying to figure out for ages what is going wrong with me. I can't say that my gp is a big help there, but the whole problem is far too complex to fully comprehend I guess.

It basically boils down to getting flare-ups of shortness of breath, mainly at night that last for about 3-5 weeks. It usually vanishes again during the day, either after breakfast or sometime later to come back the following night. A new flareup always corresponds to a massive urine excretion, which has an odd smell, kind of musty. And everything I drink seems to literally end up in the bladder immediately.

Now I have another problem of many years that also is time related: sometime in the morning I get dizzy, confused, spaced out, waxy complexion, weak, and I eat everything within reach. Thing is: this problem, which feels like very low blood sugar (but it isn't) vanishes only at dinner time in the evening, but comes back the next morning. By now I found out that it's not sugar I'm craving but salt. Eating a small spoon of salt makes this problem go away. Connection with dinner: Because in the healthy offices I've work there's no food with much salt: fruits, veggies, bread, milk, yoghurt, cereals.

I also found that salt seems to help against the shortness of breath above. Guess what though: serum sodium has always been normal to low normal. I also found that increasing my salt intake does a lot of other things: I'm not constipated when I eat more salt (no more dried out turds), I'm not thirsty anymore while I've been superthirsty since this shortness of breath first appeared nearly 4 years ago, and on and off before. I literally drank more than 5l a day. My eye lids were kind of sunken in for the same amount of time and look normal again now. When I work out I'm not coughing anymore as if my lungs are completely dried out. My orthostatic hypotension is much better now, And I don't feel constantly low on electrolytes anymore (cramps, pins and needles, twitching muscles, limbs falling asleep) which I've literally been since this whole mess started nearly 4 years ago.

Well.. kind of. Every few weeks I still lose some fluid over the kidneys. When this happens I constantly run to the toilet despite not drinking more, I get the low electrolyte symptoms again, are faster out of breath, can't poop, my eye lids look sunken in again and my lungs feel very dry and I cough frequently.

I also realize that I've been craving salty snacks pretty much all my life, on an off like the thirst. As a pre-school child I would wait for my parents to go to bed and then nick a handfull of pretzels, only to chew the salt grains off. Don't ask what I do after a workout or swimming in an ocean. And the amounts of crisps I ate is legend. Another life-long craving is licorice. It's equally intensive and never occurs together with the salt craving. I notice immediately if I eat real licorice or candy flavoured with anisseedoil (nearly anything here is this type. It drives me crazy). Both licorice and salt have an influence on kidney hormones, something with renin and aldosteron, which I can't say I fully understand.

So I really wonder what's going on, and how I can convince my gp to finally refer me to a specialist. And to what kind of specialist: endo? kidney? Btw, I'm in the UK

edit to add: and now I apparently have a pancreatitis according to my GP. Not sure if it's related. Pain started with the last loss of fluids. Not the first time I have this pain. Female, normal weight despite all the crisps, well developed muscles but low strength, no alcohol. Bloods: normal apart from lowish albumin, and always low to lowish Mg, Ca if not corrected for albumin, potassium. Frequent protein in urin"

407,Mildly high AM cortisol and unsuppressed dexamethasone suppression test,"I'm a 22/f 

They were testing me for Addison's disease, as I have more symptoms that signal to that (including unexplained weight *loss*).

My doctor ran a cortrosyn test and my baseline cortisol was higher than we expected:

* 8AM: 26.9 [H]
* 30 Minutes: 36.6
* 60 Minutes: 41.2

So I obviously passed. Because of the high 8 AM cortisol, the endocrinologist thought it would be worth doing the dexamethasone suppression test. I took the medication at 11PM and had labs drawn *exactly* at 8AM. 

* Cortisol: 2.1 [H] 

Are these clinically significant? What else could cause labs like this aside from Cushing's, as I don't have those symptoms?

Let me know if you have other questions or want other labs. 

Thank! 

Edit: I also had an elevated DHEA-S as well, so could this be something with my adrenal glands?"
408,Need help understanding thyroid results... Stressed out over it..,"Okay... Went to my GP because of being unable to lose weight. He tested me for thyroid problems.. My initial test showed TSH was 13.2uIU/mL my T3 was 26% and my T4 was 187nmol/l

Also got results for Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab >600

and Thyroglobulin Antibody was 9.3  IU/mL

They wouldn't expain it to me. I got referred to a endo but that is in a few weeks. They also upped my dose of levo to 50mcg. I'm concerned that my t4 is getting higher, and my levo dose is going up... Just don't have a good understanding of this... can someone help? I'm really stressed out over it. "
409,Aldosterone: Second Opinion,"I was feeling unwell for a while, heart racing, dizzy, went to the ER and after a while, all my vitals came back to normal. The only thing they found was a potassium level of 3. They gave me supplements, and when my levels were up the next day after a full cardiac workup that came back clean (potassium 4.1 before discharge) I went back home. 

A week later I felt the same way, HR 123, BP 180/110... But after sitting in the ER, they both returned to normal without intervention. Potassiumally 4.2, sodium 139, so it wasn't that.

 Went to my GP a week later, got bloodwork, potassium still normal (4.2), everything else in range too, not even high or low, smack in the middle. Thyroid hormones normal, female hormones normal. BP was a little high at first (140/90), but came down after they took it again (124/82) (I usually get white coat syndrome, I have bad health anxiety). I took it at my parents house with their cuff when I was relaxed, 114/77. The gp, cardiologist, and ER docs wrote it off as panic attacks and exhaustion (I've had bad insomnia for a few months). 

Back in June before all this, I had a regular physical, and my potassium was normal (4.2). The year before it was 3.7. I've never had it as low as 3.

Not satisfied, I went to an endocrinologist. Because of the hypokalemia, he did a renin/aldosterone test and repeated the metabolic panel. My potassium was a little lower (3.9), but he said that it's normal, sodium was a little higher (141), but still normal. Renin was 2.05, normal, but Aldosterone was 33. High. The ratio was 16, so he wasn't worried, but wants to repeat the test for my peace of mind. I'm waiting a few weeks to see how some better sleep, less stress, and stage of my cycle will affect it.

He seems to not be worried, but I'm terrified, as I've read about some of the scary things Aldosterone can do. 

The day of the test I woke up at 7, went to the lab, waited in the cold for 10 minutes and realized it was closed. Literally ran to the lab across the street, they had a two hour wait. Ran back, drove to another lab, the lady got me in at 8:20, but didn't give me time to sit like the other lab asked (they said to get there early to sit 5-10 minutes). I asked her if I could, she said she was in a rush and just took the blood. Could that affect things?

A bit about me: I eat pretty clean, so not a lot of salt. I'm 33f, work out pretty consistently. History of anxiety, that's it. BP spikes when anxious, but always comes back down to normal.

410,Needing an endocrinologist,"Hey I'm a 22 M having some issues and differing GP opinions. In may I went to my GP and mentioned that I haven't been able to lose weight, and feel tired. He ordered thyroid and testosterone tests. For that test, my TSH was 13.2uIU/mL my T3 was 26% and my T4 was 187nmol/l total testosterone was 170.3 ng/dl and free testosterone was 9.2 pg/ml

They then ordered other hormone tests: prostate specific ag serum 0.4ng/mL, prolactin 11.8 ng/mL, LH 4.4 mIU/mL FSH 2.5mIU/mL 

I got prescribed 25 mcg levothyroxine and was told to come back in a couple months for a retest to check dosage levels.... Due to school I was delayed in coming back and ran out of the medicine for a few weeks. 

Went back and they did a tsh only test and it was at 18.760uIU/mL 

They had me repeat the process and stick to the medicine. After about 6 weeks on 25mcg levothyroxinethe TSH level was 9.6

The issue is, during that time, I visited another doctor for acid reflux because my normal one was too busy to see me in time.. He asked if he could see my tests from the other clinic and I said sure and signed the papers. Based on that first test done at the other clinic, he believes I have a TSH secreting pituitary tumor and hyperthyroidism. He called me back in to tell me he wanted me to have an MRI done and to stop taking the levothyroxine.

 I went off of it for a week and began to feel lethargic and have a tightness in my neck. So I started taking it again and problems went away.

I had them give me a referral to an endocrinologist, which I'm still waiting on.... I just want an opinion on the situation. Thanks.."

414,What can be the cause of high cortisol and high DHEA?,"I am due to see an endocrinologist in 2 weeks from now. My doctor also suggested to get an ultrasound to look at my adrenal glands.

The reason I went to the doctor initially was due to excessive/abnormal hair growth. I'm a female and have in the past year or two been growing thick, black hairs in places like my neck and especially my chest. It has been getting worse recently.

I had a blood test which showed somewhat high cortisol and DHEA. Hence I was referred to an endocrinologist.

I've also had issues with stress/anxiety so I am thinking that might be linked to high cortisol?

Anyway I guess I am here for more information while I wait for my appt. Anyone know what are common causes for what I'm experiencing and how it might be treated? Or have any other relevant info?

Thanks"

#**Conditions I Have:**

**-Hyperhidrosis**
&nbsp;

**-Social Anxiety stemmed from Hyperhidrosis**
&nbsp;

**- CONSTANTLY FEEL OVERHEATED**
&nbsp;

-  Take a long walk after lunch, come back to cubical and body feels like its radiating all that built up heat
&nbsp;
			
-  When I get anxious, the body radiates soo much heat, I can feel it by putting my hands a couple inches away from my chest
&nbsp;
		
**-CONSTANTLY FEEL LIKE IM IN FIGHT OR FLIGHT (Resting heart rate is HIGH 80s range)**
&nbsp;
			
- Examples:
				
-  Sitting in an airplane, and I'm drenched in sweat and heart races
				
-  Cut someone off on the highway, heart races
				
-  Sports tryouts, always sucked during them because of heart racing/anxiety
					
-   Was genuinely good at them outside of the pressure situation
				
-  I'm trying to pick situations where there should be some nervousness but not this abnormal amount
	

**-High Prolactin**

- How I found out? Puffy nipples led to google searches, which led to a prolactin blood test

- Treated with Cabergoline, within three months, levels went to 0...need to follow up to figure out why

- First Endo I went to, tested for macroprolactin and told me that this non-bioactive form was the reason why my prolactin was coming out high

- First Brain MRI with contrast came out negative...was told that maybe the tumor might just be too small to see

**-Vitamin D Deficient**

- Have been taking pills but they break me out in crazy cystic acne

**-Acne/Oily Skin**

**-Low Libido**

**-Hard to gain weight/muscle**

**-Have always been easily tired since I was a child**

- Grew up playing sports and being outdoors, yet I could not run a mile without stopping for air...to this day I can't

- If I do happen to run a mile, I'll come back feeling so sick, with a fever

**-Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth**

- Caused by Clindamycin taking for acne

- Has changed what I can eat and what I cant eat

416,Low DHT?,"Hello, I was wondering about a few symptoms i have and did not know if it was worth seeing an endocrinologist about it...

I'm 28 y/o male with very limited facial hair, but everyone in my family/culture grows it pretty easily (cousins growing full beards at like 15-16..).  It's fairly even along sideburns, mustache, and chin but doesn't grow in to connect all of them and will be long enough to appear but kinda just wispy (3-4mm) after 3 days. Won't really grow much even with more time.

Additionally i have acne which is mild but something i've been dealing with for several years, and has failed abx, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, topical retinoids.  I am about to start accutane for this but given my weird facial hair situation i am wondering if the cause is something underlying like a DHT deficiency.


I don't really have other symptoms like low libido, general weakness, etc.  I have worked out for many years and have decent muscle mass (6'4"" 190 lb), though I do feel like I have plateaued in weights.


Just wondering if i'm overthinking this or if its worth getting seen and tested, especially since i would rather avoid accutane if there's an underlying cause I'm missing.

417,High TSH,"Hi All!

I'm reaching out to see if anyone could possibly explain what I've been experiencing. 

I am in my mid 20's & had a full thyroidectemy + radiation treatment 10 years ago for thyroid cancer. I am on levothyroxine & armour thyroid daily. I have continually struggled with hypothyroidism, despite attempts to regulate my medication. 

I have been experiencing an extreme fatigue, depletion of mental capability, hair loss, weight loss & weight gain, fractures  (from low to no impact), among a number of other concerning issues. On another note, I do not have Graves. Despite taking my medication daily, my recent labs show my TSH at 31.57 uIU/mL. With retesting, I get the same results.

No other signs of metabolic syndrome, no other health problems, no smoking, no alcohol. Oestroprogestatives taken before and a little while after menopause, but she stopped them since almost a year.


It's true she doesn't have a perfect diet but she doesn't exaggerate with food and doesn't eat a lot of fats. She has a normal BMI, doesn't do a particular sport activity, but walks a lot to work, at work and for various house chores. My father has the same lifestyle and his lipid panel is normal.

432,Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency,"I was diagnosed with GH deficiency as a child and underwent replacement therapy for 4 years. I was never retested after linear growth finished and have not seen an endocrinologist since. I am now 29 and have suffered from atypical depression for several years. After no response to traditional SSRIs, SNRIs, etc, I've gathered that altering my brain chemistry having not tested the baseline parameters has done more harm than good. Beyond depression, further symptoms are hallmark. I have done extensive research on adult GHD, specifically for patients with pediatric onset and treatment, but have found very little information regarding later adulthood follow-up. This leads me to believe that there may be a lacking of evidence or study pools in this field of research that could potentially benefit by using myself in clinical studies. I currently work as a paramedic and cannot afford the shoddy health insurance provided by my employer. So finding a specialist that may be interested for pure research is my best alternative. If someone knows of such a specialist or group that may be interested, or can provide some useful information, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks and Happy New Year's.

435,"Mystery Illness - Cortisol, DHEAS, 5a/5b Steroids","* Age: 30
* Height: 5ft 10""
* Weight: 125lbs
* Duration of illness: Almost 10 years (probably longer)
* Location: UK
* Current medication: None


I've been ill for almost 10 years now with a very severe, debilitating and strange mystery illness. It began when I was 20 and at the time seemed to come on completely out of the blue, although looking back I'm now certain I'd been ill for most of my life. Doctors have so far been unable to help and my quality of life is very poor. A lot of the symptoms are very weird so I was hoping someone might have some ideas or thoughts on what it might be/where to look.

The illness started one day at midday. I began to feel very weak and generally ill, which quickly increased to feeling nauseous, my heart had begun to pound very forcefully and I was shaking. Apparently I looked extremely pale too - my lips and face were very white. This continued throughout the afternoon until between 5-6pm when I started to feel better. I went to bed assuming I was over whatever it had been. However the next day at the same time (12pm) the exact same thing happened - began to feel awful which lasted all afternoon until between 5-6pm and then much improved again. This happened for a few days in a row before I realised something was seriously wrong and went to the doctors. Since then the same thing has happened every day for 10 years following the same pattern - always between the hours of 12pm to 5-6pm. Like clockwork. The only difference is that over time the period before and after the ""slump"" has become much worse to the point that I'm now housebound and can do very little.

From the first few weeks of being ill I have had many blood tests raised over the 10 years - neutrophils, ESR, CRP, platelets, ALT etc. However these would only be raised in the winter months. Over the last 10 years I've had something wrong in my blood tests every single year but only between the months of October through to April. In the summer months my blood tests are perfect. But in October something will begin to rise, e.g. the neutrophils, and increase until Jan/Feb when it gets to its highest before starting to fall in March. By May they're basically back to normal and in August they're perfect. This also follows how I feel in that I always see an improvement in the summer. In fact I tracked the temperatures over a year and found I feel better the warmer it is. Whatever the cold weather is doing to my body is making the whole illness worse, and that shows up in my blood tests.

The other symptoms that developed over time are:

* Hair loss - from scalp, underarm, pubic and legs
* Low temperature - 35.7 C to 36.5 C
* Low blood pressure - averages around 105/65
* Heart - beats too strongly 24/7
* Awful digestion - bloating, gas, wind, lack of appetite 
* Weakness - really extreme (can only stand for a few minutes)
* Constant earworms - the first thing I'm aware of when I wake up is s song and it's the last thing when I go to sleep
* Seborrheic Dermatitis - on face and in scalp 
* Restlessness - even though I feel so ill and weak I can't sit still. I'm constantly fidgeting.
* Libido - bizarrely, is raised.

Most recently I also had my blood DHEAS and urine 5a/5b steroids raised. Alongside those I have high cortisol every time it's tested and a high ACTH in the blood, and this seems like it points to there being some endocrine, specifically the adrenal glands, involvement. But those raised levels and tests indicate something more like Cushings Syndrome/Disease or a tumour, whereas my symptoms are far more like I'm lacking hormones (quite a few doctors I've seen have assumed it was adrenal insufficiency/Addisons but my synacthen test was apparently fine)

Lab results: (I've used the highest one's over the entirety of being ill) 

* Cortisol - lowest: 650 nmol/, highest: 975 nmol/l
* ACTH - 102 ng/l
* DHEAS - 18.8 mm/l
* ESR - 60 mm/h
* CRP - 77 mg/l
* Neutrophils - 13
* ALT - 330 iu/l


I just hoped that someone might have some thoughts based on the above description, symptoms and test results as to what it might be, or its basis? Does it sound like it's an endocrine problem? What is the relevance of the 5a/5b steroids being raised, and what are they? Are there any hormones that change specifically at 12pm or 5/6pm. Or does it sound like something else entirely? Any help/ideas/suggestions etc would be hugely appreciated! Just an idea of where to focus my efforts or a direction to head in would be something. Sorry for how long this is!

Thanks!"

437,Low progesterone and estradiol questions,"Hello! I'm a 23-year-old female. I have had low progesterone consistently for maybe ~8 years and recently learned I have low estradiol. My GYN is concerned about the effects of the latter on my bones and may put me on birth control. I'm a little hesitant about that because I've heard of people ending up in a worse state than they started in after stopping BC. I have a few questions:

1. What's the difference between taking birth control as opposed to just taking estrogen and progesterone? Differences in outcome, side effects, cost, mechanism, anything really. Which is preferable? 

2. Is it better to have a GYN or an endocrinologist managing this sort of thing?

3. Are there any methods of fixing this that don't involve taking hormones? Like, maybe lifestyle changes or something that tend to work for some patients? I know this isn't that likely, but I'm not in a hurry to go on BC and would be willing to try something.

4. This might be silly, but would taking estrogen (BC or otherwise) be likely to cause breast growth? And is there any way that could be avoided. I'm already considering a reduction as it is. Not sure I could handle more. "
438,Questions about RAAS in high renin hypertension,"
I feel like I have a decent grasp of how and where each hormone is made but I’m having trouble putting some things together.

 


Angiotensinogen is made and release by the liver and floats around until it meets up with renin, which is made and released by the juxtoglomerular cells in the kidney after a sense of decreased renal perfusion pressure. Renin cuts a 10 amino acid chain from the angiotensinogen, creating angiotensin 1. Angiotensin 1 floats through blood vessels and then is cut down to an 8 amino acid chain by ACE in the endothelial cells in certain blood vessels, creating angiotensin 2.

 


Angiotensin 2 then raises blood pressure primarily though vasoconstriction, but also by telling the pituitary gland to release ADH and the adrenals to release aldosterone.
ADH is a 9 chain amino acid protein made and released by the Supra optic nucleus in the pituitary gland. It’s release is stimulated primarily by high blood concentration, but also by low blood volume, low blood pressure, and angiotensin 2. It raises blood pressure by creating channels to allow water permeability into blood vessels, increasing blood volume.

 


Aldosterone is made and excreted by the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. It’s release is typically triggered by low blood pressure. It raises blood pressure by pulling sodium and water into the blood vessels and increasing blood volume. It is K sparing and therefore raises osmolarity.

 


Does that sound right?

 


So for someone with both elevated renin and aldosterone, but with a normal ratio, would you assume the most likely possible cause as idiopathic hypovolemia? Could the decreased blood volume trigger the release of both renin and aldosterone and therefore cause high arterial blood pressure?

 

 
And despite that high blood pressure, because of the continued low blood volume, the kidneys continue to release renin? If someone does have low blood volume and high blood pressure, would you extpect a low renal perfusion pressure? Would you expect this to lead to chronic kidney disease over time?

 


What does this mean for angiotensin? I assume someone with elevated renin would also have elevated angiotensin 1, leading to elevated angiotensin 2. Which is why high renin hypertension responds well to the antihypertensive medications ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Does the liver produce a set amount of angiotensinogen that is unused and excreted without renin or does it release more in times of low pressure?

 

 
Would salt loading and increased fluid intake in a person with both elevated renin and aldosterone increase blood volume and therefore decrease aldosterone and ADH production, leading to a decrease in blood pressure despite the pressure increase because of the higher blood volume?

 


Do we know the possible underlying causes that could contribute to this sort of dysfunction in the RAAS?"

I've been prescribed Ativan, all it does is make me sleepy. A recent blood test showed my cortisol levels were high-normal, thyroid hormones mid-range normal, but epinephrine/norepinephrine levels were very high. my doc asked me if i was squeamish around needles because that might explain the high levels, but i told her that i wasn't nervous or anxious for the blood test at all. I mentioned that I was always like that, my pulse is always high (100-110bpm resting), my legs always wobble and my hands are always shaky. she asked if i had anxiety and i said ""occasionally. i could be fully calm and content and still get these same results. but the physical symptoms do get worse when i feel any kind of stress, good or bad"". if I thought something was really funny or if i found out really good news, i had the same physical reaction as if it were bad stress.

She set up an ultrasound appointment to see if anything was wrong with my adrenal glands. I did some research on my own about adrenal gland disorders and no described disorder was similar to my symptoms. i know none of you can diagnose me and i can't diagnose myself with this type of thing, all i'm looking for is a possible explanation because I hate feeling like i'm the only person in the world like this.

443,Low Testosterone but no severe symptoms,"Few months ago I had some ED issues and got really scared. So I did  some labwork and it turned out that I've low testosterone. My doctor did the labwork three times and in all three times it came out low. Everything else was normal. Just testosterone was low (200 range) and prolactin was above normal range (30). I'm 28 y male. 

I don't have any severe low T symptoms. My libido is not that bad. I often get random boner (even sometimes when talking with my gf over phone!). Masterbation is also fine. Can have fun without porn. Morning erection is also not bad. There are some times when I am stressed out, I noticed that my erection quality degrades (soft erection, not hard enough to penetrate) but otherwise I get good hard erection every morning. 

I am not sure what other symptoms to look at. I don't think I'm depressed. I am doing quite well in my job and studies. I get tired easily but don't have extreme fatigue. My hair is also good. Didn't notice any hair loss. However I always had very less facial hair (can't grow beard). 

Is this normal? My doctor is suggesting that I take clomiphene as I'm too young for TRT. At this point I'm mostly worried about my ED issues and fertility. I plan to have kids soon ( < 1.5 year). ED wise, in bed I usually get good erection but sometimes I lose it quickly. "

446,"Endo perplexed, subclinical hypo, hashimotos, adrenal hyperplasia??","Hi all, this is my first time posting here so I am not sure how much background you need. I am 31 (32 in a few weeks) and was pregnant last year. I have always had my TSH a little high (between 2.8-4) and when I was TTC (trying to conceive) I went to an RE (reproductive endocrinologist) who said I had subclinical hypothyroidism. She said not to treat it since I had 0 symptoms and I am already pretty skinny (not bragging, I've always been thin) so we didn't treat it. 

After my son was born October 2016, I breastfed for 4 months. After I stopped, I expected a period. Nothing. I had my full thyroid panel tested and everything was normal. Here are the results:

Thyroid Panel With TSH
TSH 2.790 uIU/mL
Thyroxine (T4) 5.4 ug/dL
T3 Uptake 27 % 
Free Thyroxine Index 1.5 
Thyroglobulin Antibody <1.0 IU/mL 
Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab 15 IU/mL 

With no period and my hormone levels (prolactin, etc) normal, she referred me to an endocrinologist who specializes is thyroid issues. They did the ACTH challenge at 9:20am in office (3 hours after i woke up) and my results are as follows:

Cortisol #1 (Base) 2.9 ug/dL

Cortisol #2 4.8 ug/dL 

Cortisol #3 5.2

To clarify, I had very similar test results for the ACTH challenge in 2010 and 2012. I have been on and off steroids for my asthma my whole life so i don't know how this affects things. I am still waiting for my DHEA test results and some others but I am at a loss. Do I have subclinical hypothyroidism, Non-classic adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal insufficiency or none/all? If you have had adrenal insufficiency/fatigue, were you asymptomatic like me?

447,AGHD Assessment in Clinical Trials,"Quick question for endocrinologists with clinical-trial expertise,

A biotech company called AEterna Zentaris is seeking approval for the first-ever indicator (Macrilen) to detect the presence of growth hormone deficiency in adult patients. While the Phase 3 clinical trial of Macrilen had showed some impressive results:

sensitivity (87%) and specificity (96%) of the Macrilen™ test were satisfactory and reproducible, and the co-primary endpoint “negative agreement” with the compared Insulin Tolerance Test was met

the trial failed to meet the ""positive agreement"" endpoint, the importance of which is understandably being understated by the company. They're pushing forward with an NDA for Macrilen, and I was just hoping to hear some experienced perspectives on how big of a risk the failed ""positive agreement"" component represents, and how sorely needed such an AGHD assessment is needed?

He did some blood work and referred me to a urologist. Urologist again did several blood works. I don't have all the results with me right now. So I am summarising the results-

- T and free T- always came out in lower range. T was 215-345 range. 
- FS and LSH - normal. 
- Prolactin - high (15, 19 and then 29 in three tests)
- Ultrasound testicles- no issues. According to doctor it's in ""remarkable good"" condition lol!

My urologist didn't want me to prescribe any T therapy as I'm still young and have plans to have kids in near future. He is not sure what's going on though. So he referred me to an andrologist. After doing some online research I am now considering following-

- Can it be a pituitary gland tumor? My primary care doc mentioned the possibility of this but he didn't do any MRI. I read that the symptoms like low libido, headache, low T, less facial hair, high prolactin can be related to tumor in pituitary gland. I should mention that I don't have much facial hair (can't grow beard) and have history of headache since my teenage.

- Should I see an endocrinologist instead of andrologist? It's been more than a year and still I don't know whats going on. One doctor is referring to another and it's going on and on :(

- Is it possible to stimulate T production without taking T supplement? Like increase FH production which will stimulate T production... ?

I badly want to get to the bottom of this and I'm really frustrated.

453,"Question about hematocrit, RBC, and hemoglobin","After my recent labs, I have levels of 50.5 hematocrit,  18.0 hemoglobin, and 5.89 rbc. Hemoglobin and RBC are a little above normal and the hematocrit is above normal. The doctor dropped my injections to every 2 weeks instead of every 10 days as well. If it is the testosterone therapy that is causing it, how long does it take for levels to go up? What are considered dangerous levels? At what levels does blood start to clot?"
454,TSH,Is a TSH 0.68 mcIU/mL (0.30 - 5.00 mcIU/mL) very low even though it falls in the normal range according to physician's. I'm wondering if i may benefit from armour thyroid?

I been experiencing symptoms of what I thought could be related to low testosterone but for years thought it was something different. To cut it short I remember I had blood tests taken because of my symptoms in 2014 and 2015
In 2014 at 28 years of age my TT was at 484ng/dl 13 months later in 2015 it was at 242ng/dl Both of those were oddly at the same time of day (12pm)
Now in 2017 I had more blood work done that showed a level of 213ng/dl taken at 10am in the morning. My doctor said to ""monitor this"" (new doctor, he does not yet know about the 2 other tests because I did some digging at my old doctors office to find them to confirm I had a 50% decrease in testosterone between 2014-2015). Should I meet the criteria for a diagnosis of hypogonadism based on these results or at least steer me in the right direction?
Background info on me: Not and never was obese No diabetes I live an active lifestyle that involves lifting weights Don't smoke and do not drink alcohol I take no medications that can explain this drop in T level
TL;DR: I had a total testosterone level of 484ng/dl in 2014, 242ng/dl in 2015, and now 213ng/dl in 2017. Is this alarming for someone who is only 31 years old at the moment? "
457,Endocrinal?,"Hi guys,

been having episodes of shortness of breath for a few years now and doctors are none the wiser. They tell me that heart and lungs are fine and that I'm hyperventilating. True, but if I don't while being out of breath I feel much worse. Thus the hyperventilation makes me feel better.

Thinking about how this comes about i wonder if it might be something endocrine. A new episode is triggered by running and flying and pops up at night. It's always accompanied by massive peeing, several times that night without me drinking more than normal. Things get better in the course of the day and then it pops up again the coming night. How the triggers come into play is something I don't know.

Thinking about it, I feel these episodes might be related to fluid control somehow, which in return is controlled by hormones I think. In times where I have to pee every night my running performance is worse than when I'm not as I feel more winded at a lower pace. In periods where I don't have to go to the toilet at night I'm generally heavier by a bit and my running performance is so much better. I'm just able to go on and on. Both states seem to happen in intervals, and if I sleep through my nights for a few weeks it's likely I get another period where I have to pee once every night. After a few weeks of great running and sleeping through my nights is also when all those episodes appeared. 

Taking calcium seems to soften the nightly shortness of breath, through front end loading doesn't work. I was very out of breath recently after experimenting with a water pill (something against high altitude sickness), and this made me pee so badly for days. When eating a bag of crisps though the shortness of breath vanished very quickly. I have an interesting relationship with salt anyway. 

So I guess the shortness of breath might be secondary to the peeing and loss of electrolytes. But why? Does this make sense at all?"

461,When is total thyroidectomy necessary?,"So my mother was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer and her doctor suggested to have the whole thyroid removed. 

We are going to get a second opinion but we also wanna hear what you guys think. 

Here is our email exchange:

""The surgery is to remove the entire gland. Her type of cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, tends to be mutifocal (meaning it can happen at different parts of the gland). Her current tumor is in the middle part, between the two lobes. That is why we need to take it all because it can happen in the future in a different area of the gland. The incision is across the neck, usually about 6-8 cm wide or as long as we need to get the whole gland out safely.""

I asked if it's really necessary, his response: 

""Yes, because the tumor is in the middle of the two sides of the gland, she needs the entire gland removed. If it was on one side, sometimes we can preserve the other side. However, like I said before, there is a high chance of getting a new cancer on the other side if we leave it behind."""

469,Please help me figure out what is off and how to fix it.,"Hey guys. I am kind of at a loss. I know something is off, but I am unsure what exactly is off. Your help would be greatly appreciated. I am female, 29yrs old, 5'2"", 167lbs. I do not have insurance and need to figure out how to treat this as naturally as possible. 

My symptoms:

Weight gain and inability to lose weight. I have ALWAYS struggled with my weight. I understand that people have different metabolic speeds, but my partner and I eat the exact same thing every day (plant based diet). We spend a lot of time together and have similar activity levels. We are both girls. She weighs 117lbs and I weigh 167lbs. Every time we start making an effort to eat really well and exercise, she starts losing weight and I stay the same, or even gain. 

I struggle with depression and anxiety. It comes and goes. I take herbal supplements, but after being put on a huge string of mess on high school, I don't take prescriptions. They have only ever made it worse. I have mood springs sometimes. It gotten better. The ashwaganda I take has really helped, but it is still there. Some days worse than others. I feel so apathetic when it's bad. I don't want to do anything. 

I have very very low energy. It's ruinin me. I used to love hiking, going out, and making art. But now I don't really want to do anything. Even when I want to, I feel tired. 

Mental fog is becoming an increasing issue. 

I bloat and struggle to digest food well.  

I am pretty sure I have endometriosis. I have most of the symptoms, to include having had an ectopic pregnancy. 

The weight and mood are messing with me the very most. Any suggestions or ideas you have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I transitioned very early, before puberty, and received high doses of oral estrodial..I've done some research, and have come to find that oral estrodial inhibits the liver from releasing IGF. My leg to body ratio is also what one might call neotenous... I'm essentially shaped and look like an aged 9-12 year- my face, voice, and body. I desperately want help. My confidence is pretty much non-existent. I'm tired of people being totally shocked by my age and making a big deal of it.. I'd like to see an endocrinologist to see if perhaps they could help me, but I have no idea where to start. I realize this is a complicated case, but I'm willing to go to great lengths to get treatment or to find a solution for this issue. I realize that the estrodial likely fused growth plates in my long bones, but hopefully my face and voice can still be salvaged. Again, I realize this is a complicated case, but please, if you have annnny idea of where I might start looking for a solution, I'd so appreciate a reply."

Also get periods of headaches, and a strange metallic taste in my mouth. However, latter symptoms have reduced (not cleared) with wearing glasses while working at computer, so possibly unrelated.

Been going to doctor for 3 years about this. Was referred to urologist who told me my balls were fine, it's psychological, and I should take viagra. Both failed/refused to check estrogen/shbg, had to get tested privately to get results which show that they're high.

475,"Possible Adrenal Insufficiency & mTBI, also possible hx of adrenal crisis missed due to mTBI sx","Longtime Reddit lurker, first post. Almost 8 mo ago I got a concussion and am still having issues especially no appetite, weight loss, nausea, HA, on & off depression, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, no/low libido, fatigue, significantly increased cold intolerance, period all over the place, and low HR still despite the fact the I haven't been able to consistently work out in almost a year (had hip surgery a few months before my concussion). GP ordered a abdomen/pelvic CT to r/o cancer (was totally normal, other than a random kidney cyst that's been there for a while and 2 ureters on one side), bunch of blood work including CBC, metabolic panel, electrolytes, thyroid levels, celiac (all neg) and cortisol. The only thing that was worth looking further into was AM cortisol at 8.9, she is referring me to an Endo and I'm trying to get the blood work started before I go see the Endo since that appt is 3 weeks away. I have some questions based on the research I've done and was hoping someone who has seen this stuff way more than me can tell me if my logic is going in the right direction/if there's anything I'm missing that I should be researching. 

I've been doing a ton of research about AI & AI in relation to mTBI. I was pretty surprised about how much I found about a mTBI being a cause of AI, I studied sports med in undergrad and had never been taught about there being any relation between the two and I did a ton of research on concussion. One journal article in particular in the Journal of Family Practice created suggestions as to when to look into [Neuroendocrine dysfunction in mTBI](http://www.mdedge.com/jfponline/article/79596/pain/neuroendocrine-dysfunction-following-mild-tbi-when-screen-it) pts. They recommend screening pts for NED when their TBI sx have lasted more than 3 months. My question with that is how well known is that recommendation in the endo world? I haven't been keeping up with the sports med side of concussion since I'm no longer in the field, but my concussion dr hasn't mentioned anything about this being a possibility and she is pretty well versed on the current recommendations for concussion.

Next question is what is the possibility that something I experienced about a month and a half post concussion was the beginning of adrenal crisis that got missed because it was similar to my concussion sx/concussion could have made me feel worse than I would have otherwise? Got a GI bug that caused major nausea and diarrhea (never vomited but that's probably because I was taking zofran like it was candy at that point in my concussion), fever, really uncomfortable leg pain, abdominal cramping, tachycardia, and confusion. I honestly felt like I was going to die, I've never felt that way before and I have a pretty extensive medical hx (spontaneous pneumothorax, noro virus that got me admitted for 3 days, 6 major surgeries including brain surgery for a benign cerebellar brain tumor, long ass list of food allergies that have resulted in a ton of ER visits for anaphylaxis before we finally figured out everything I was allergic to). Essentially what I'm trying to convey is I'm no stranger to scary medical shit happening to me and this was by far the worst I ever felt other than maybe one HA I got post craniotomy. In the ER they thought I had the flu, flu test was neg. They gave me a bag of saline and initially a dose of IV zofran 4mg. The zofran worked for all of 45 mins maybe so they gave me another 4mg dose of zofran. Nausea broke through that in 20 mins or so. Then they gave me 10 mg IV Reglan, that finally got the nausea under control so I didn't feel as horrible. I've never had nausea that hard to control even when I was in the ICU post craniotomy. Final ER dx: viral syndrome. Still felt like garbage for a few days, saw my concussion dr a few days later and still looked pretty pale/sick and had abdominal pn with palpation.

I know I need to probably wait to get the blood results back about if I have AI, but let's assume I have some sort of AI. To me it seems likely that I had an adrenal crisis that luckily had a good outcome. That is just based on my research and what I remember about how I felt and the ER dr's report. Not a Dr yet, but working towards it (doing post-bac pre-MD/PhD classes) so looking at this as a learning experience too for complicated diagnoses."
476,Here's a list of problems that make me think I have hormonal issues.,"Female, Age 26
(*TL;TR available)

    (I turned to you guys because I don't have health insurance anymore and I'm jobless at the time, so doctors appointments are really expensive for me right now 😔 Also excuse me in advance for any English mistakes, it's not my native language.)
    First of all I've been examined for my thyroid  bland several months ago. Even though the doctor said I'm gonna have problems in the future due to ""thyroiditis"", she also said I don't need medication right now. But I think I have some symptoms of hypothyroidism.
    Also after some (google) digging I think high prolactin has much in common with hypothyroidism in terms of symptoms. So I'm really confused and I would really love to hear some opinions about all this.
   
-BODY WEIGHT: In the past 2 to 3 years I've gain almost 15-20kg. Especially this last year is really hard to lose even 1kg. And though I tried eating right for the past 18 months, lately I think I might be putting on more weight.
-PERIOD: My period has got all weird lately. Even though I've had unstable cycle since my very 1st period, and even though I have polycystic ovaries, I'm seeing changes. My cycle has gone from 40+ to 50+ (I've hit a ""record"" with 70 days recently), and I feel like a balloon for 10-20 days until my period comes (plus my breasts become almost double and really painful).
-PSYCHOLOGY: In the past I had gone through depression but not for long and also it wasn't super serious. But this past winter it hit me really hard, I've almost hit rock bottom   and even though I tried and keep on trying to get better, I don't think it's over.
-""ENERGY"": I don't know what energy is anymore. Sometimes I wake up fine and I'm a little tired through the day, and others I just wanna lay in bed all day. 
-""BRAIN"": I used to have a really great memory but in the past 2-3 years my brain keeps on failing me. Sometimes I can't remember things that happened literally moments ago. 


*TL;TR :  
My metabolism, 
My period,
My psychology,
My energy,
And my brain suck even more the past year(s). What hormonal imbalances can take the blame for all that? 
Is there a connection between hypothyroidism and high prolactin?"
477,Let's Talk Bone Age X-Ray,"My son presents with short stature. He is turning 3 in almost 2 months and he is 31 inches tall and wears 15 month clothing. 18 month and 2t clothing fall right off him.

No one in my family is abnormally short. Men average 6 ft in height, females are mostly of 5'6"" and 5'7"" with maybe one or two female relatives measuring 5'4"" or so. My son was born at 39.5 weeks and at 19 inches tall. Endo did basic blood tests and growth hormones are ok. Celiac was borderline and his calcium was high so those two tests have to be repeated.

When I took him to his inital appointment, I asked if a bone x-ray would be done so we can see if his growth is delayed physically but his endo says that it's pointless to do until around the age of 6 because you can't predict what his height will be until around then. My question is, would it be worth it to have it done anyway just to see how his growth compares to other kids of his age? I don't mind that he's small but he's the only one in the family that wasn't born premature that's abnormally small and if he's small due to a medical condition, I want to know because different conditions cause different issues.

However my T is consistently low (in every lab work) and I'm having ED issues affecting my relationship. I talked with an Endocronologist and she suggested me to take T therapy. However I would like to know the reason behind my low T. 

My LHS and FSH is in normal range. I attached a copy of my recent labwork here: http://imgur.com/a/GyeoD

It's obvious that my pituitary isn't sending signal to testies to produce more T. Any recommendation? I was hoping that this pituitary abnormality can be treated to help my low T situation. I would appreciate any guidance or direction on this matter."
480,[X/Post from /r/Testosterone] Help with bloodwork please!?,"Can someone please look at my 2 sets of results and help decipher some of this for me? I know that there are some results missing but there should be enough there to get a general idea of what or what isn't going on.
[June Results](http://imgur.com/a/hlcba)
[March Results](http://imgur.com/a/ZreKo)

Suffering from typical Low T symptoms; Low Libido, fatigue, muscle loss/weakness, no morning wood, weight gain around the waist, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, brain fog, dead inside, no desire or passion for anything including once loved hobbies, mood swings, sleeping issues etc.
5""1 @ 67KG so yeah I could lose some weight, eating fairly healthy, get a few kms of high speed walking in per day but that's about the max exercise I can get in at the moment with current life and family commitments, wanting to get back into weights training.

Meds: Serepax/Oxazepam 15mg one tablet daily for the anxiety.
Former meds: Cymbalta for depression, Slow release Tramadol for back pain (short stint); have not taken for over 12 months possibly longer so I don't think these are anything to be concerned with 

Used to do weights training a few years ago but plateaued and was also having libido issues so went and saw an Endo with T results ranging from 4.4nmol/L to 6.6nmol/L but was told I had no issues because I had a beard, broad shoulders and a kid - since then been suffering in silence for about 2 years now because everything went back to what I perceived as ""normal"" which I have since realised it is not normal and that I have been suffering for a long time after about 6-8 months ago my levels crashed like shit and here I am today suffering worse than ever.

I personally think I’ve had some kind of an issue my entire life, I’ve never felt motivated or had any drive, never been able to focus or wanted to learn any more than what was required, never really been horny (maybe as a teenager when you first discover the glory that is the coveted jerk) and generally only able to go once and no longer interested after that point, and always felt like I was never 100%, worth mentioning that I’ve pretty much have had love handles my entire life and always carried weight around my waistline which I’ve read is related to T issues(?). I've felt held back my entire life, I’ve always felt that I was meant to do something with my life, anything really, but just could never be fucked getting up and doing it for unknown reasons which I stupidly accepted as the norm.

I'm hoping someone would be able to make a little more sense of some of these results and I totally understand if you can't with some things missing. I have some other results that I’m happy to post if required but they are even older so might not be so relevant. It's been a long road for me and I’ve had enough, if I don't get some kind of help soon I feel like this might be the end for me as I’m ready to give up (already gave it a half-arse crack just to feel something but couldn't commit)!

I have a follow up appointment with the Endo on 21/07 but now I’m worried with these results that they are going to steer me towards Hyperthyroidism but even though that's the first time the results have been blown out like that and I don't feel like I have the Hyper sides, if anything I have sides relating more to Hypo. I'm also concerned that these higher T levels compared to other results will mean that even if I get put on TRT (which I should be at those levels IMO) I’m not even sure if will be covered by Medicare - do any Aussies have experience with this? What levels are covered by Medicare and if they aren't what is the rough out of pocket cost?

If I think of anything else I will edit it in after and apologies for the long post, I’m just lost and need help + a mini vent.

Thanks in advance guys! I know there are a lot of smart and helpful people on here and I’m hoping that I can tap into that resource with the intent to return the favour one day once I’m in the TRT club and feel like a normal human being again!!

Anyone have any other ideas? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Also just some other things I've noticed;


* Symptoms seem to change every few days/weeks


* Teeth have been taken a beating and keep just degrading and chipping away


* Wake up several times a night


* Not sure if related but there was a random case of Gout and also at a separate time there was time where there was constant rectal bleeding but the colonoscopy found nothing


* Been getting an ache behind the testes but more concentrated on the right one - should i be concerned or just write it off as pressure from my hemorrhoid?



Thanks again!

481,I'm convinced I have some sort of endocrine disorder - what do you think of these symptoms?,"• Fatigue 
• Heat Intolerance
• Excessive Sweating
• Waking up at night/Insomnia
• Anxiety
• Depression
• Hand tremors 

I've had TSH/FT3/FT4 all checked and they're 'normal' apparently; the doctor turned round and told me that there is no medical cause for this which made me so angry and frustrated I nearly started crying in the office. Can anybody give me some advice? 

I also take 30mg Mirtazapine and follow a low-carb, dairy free diet to avoid acne if that's any help."
482,Low LH but normal FSH,"My testosterone levels have been tested a few times always to be low in the 200's (usually around 250-290).
My LH level is also low but FSH level is normal. My doctor's are surprised by this. Does anyone know what could be causing this?
They seem to think it could be something involving the Hypothalamus region of the brain.

Also, for what it's worth, my erythrocytes are low, hematocrit is low as well as hemoglobin, and my MCV and platelet count came back low. My thyroid is also borderline low."
483,[25M] Low Testosterone and Nobody Will Take Me Seriously,"I am a 25 year-old male who suffers from symptoms of low testosterone. Normal levels are between 241-827. Five years ago (aged 20) I first brought symptoms to the attention of my doctor. Results were on the lower end of normal at 381. Being in normal range the doctor didn't do anything about it. Didn't look further into my symptoms, nothing. 

Five months ago I took another test ordered by a new doctor. At that time my level was 249. Bear in mind that the absolute low for the ""normal"" threshold is 241. At twenty-five years old I was a mere eight points above ""normal"" out of a 586 point range. Bear in mind also that testosterone levels are at peak levels early in the morning. Both tests were at 9am. Typically (from what I recall) mens' testosterone levels fall as much as **30%** throughout the course of the day. That being the case, by the end of the day my levels could be as low as 174. 

Guys. I'm twenty-five years old. Not forty-five. Not sixty. I am twenty-five years old. I should be in my prime and yet I don't feel like a man at all. Which leads to my symptoms...

I am exhausted all of the time.

I have trouble losing weight and putting on muscle.

I gain weight very easily.

I have nearly zero libido.

I have a hard time getting erect.

I have a hard time staying erect.

My erections are never ""rock-hard."" I haven't felt completely hard since I was sixteen. Anymore I can barely tell whether i'm hard or not without looking at it. I don't feel swollen. I don't feel it at all. 

I have nearly zero libido. My fiancee is drop-dead gorgeous and great in bed. She's an easy 9/10 in my eyes. Even so most of the time I have zero interest in sex. This really puts a strain on our relationship. 

I don't know what else to say. I met with an endocrinologist (upon my insistence for a referral) and all she did was look at my level, say i'm ""within normal range"" and sent me on my way. 

I am goddamn tired of not feeling like a goddamn man. I want to at least try supplements. I am miserable.

What can I do?"

Can some experts look at these and give me their opinion? I was told I have a prolactinoma on my pituitary from an MRI result but doctors did not put me on any of the drugs bro/caber to shrink it?

I struggle to lose weight even on a low calorie diet and great exercise regimen and I am convinced there may be something else going on here. Thoughts? 

Thank you!






"
486,Bio vs synthetic/ Male everywhere but in my hormones. Scared.,"Ok.  So, I'm a scientist but this is FAR from my field.  I've been sick all my life but it has got worse in the last five years.  Not here to cry about that, don't worry!  Well unless talking about which hormones are considered crying about it, then run away lol

I just had a head to toe check up in one of the rare clinics that offer this.  I'm far from rich since I haven't worked in the last five years.  I'm in a socialist country.  So please don't think that there are many doctors here who can answer my questions for free.  I had to travel five hours and rent a room for 5 days ...  

I got some new diagnosis and some were repeats.  I expected some of the repeats, some of the new ones I knew that I would get and one really shocked me (the hormonal one that we will get to in a second).

So the old diagnosis: Fibromyalgia (aka unexplained pain that needs to be named anyways lol), chronic pain syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, gastroparesis (idiopathic/no diabetes but I have gained weight so it could be coming).

New diagnosis: Extremely lactose intolerant, borderline glucose intolerant (I failed 1 out of 4 tests) and got the results via VoiceMail once I got home so I do not know if I'm considered having Celiacs or not.  I will watch gluten for 30 days according to what the doc said anyway and see if it makes a difference.  Migraines (they didn't go much further and gave me a Rx for them).  For my sleep, I was prescribed Flexeril.  I know, it's a muscle relaxer and I started saying that when the doc cut me off to say that it's been shown to help people have a better sleep in recent studies which hopefully will help me need less sleep to function.  I have gallbladder stones but they aren't hurting so they won't be removed.  I have a ''fatty liver'' and I need to lose weight.  I have gained 70 lbs since becoming sick.  I was vegan and ran every day before.  I didn't smoke or drink or do any drugs.  I had never felt better in my entire life, to be honest!  That was for a decade I'd say.

I saw 2-3 specialists every day and had a schedule to follow for that.  They would order tests.  I would go do them and would meet with a doc who would interpret them all at the end but specialist's in between gave me any new test results and would tell me that they couldn't help since it wasn't their department.  I didn't much care.  It was nice to know before my time there was up and it was my last day.

I saw the gastroenterologist and what I didn't know is that he also is an expert in hormones.  He has multiple degrees I guess and a clinic for hormones at another location.  We started talking about my gastroparesis and my symptoms.  He suddenly says ''WHAT THE FUCK'' while looking at the computer.  I think we had bonded enough for him to say that at that point haha.  He put his hand over his mouth.  He rubbed his eyes, read the results again and looked at me and said it like it was: ''You have the hormones of a female.  You're hormonally female''.  Now, I know that this would shock anyone but I almost had a moment of happiness.  Then I had a moment of panic.  He asked me if I was intersexed to which I replied no and I told him that some of the tests that I had already passed at the clinic (there) would have shown if I were.  I am physically male on the outside and on the inside.  I currently identify as a gay male but my body has always been ''weird'' so to say.  Nothing major or I think that the doctors who have seen me over the years would have noticed something.  It was enough for me to know that I didn't grow like the other boys did.  I have small feminine hands and feet.  A soft female-like face.  I do grow body hair.  I've never really known what my gender is.  With all my issues at the moment,  I had resigned myself to live as a male.  It's what I am or look like anyways.  Why spend energy on this if I never leave my house anyways due to being sick.  I'm just a being here, alone in my apartment.  My cats don't care and I don't care.

Now, I was given reasons to care.  Taking testosterone could make me feel better and take away a lot of pain.  I know that a lot of you may think: ''then just do it already and stop suffering!'' and I wish it were that simple.  

I have 3 choices at the moment: take T, stay as I am or take whatever female hormones they would give me (estrogen I guess?  Maybe progesterone?).  We didn't discuss further than that.  Our time was up and he gave me his card.  I didn't look at it until I got home.  I felt like her really cared.  Turns out he has a few clinics that are dedicated to hormones and more specifically, Bio.  Now, I think I see why he was so nice to me.  I'm worth about 900$ on his website.  Well to be ''treated'' that is.  Especially if he knows that in my case, he can get the government to pay (more than likely I think-I need to look further into that).

So I have cried for 5 years that I want my old life back.  That I'm tired of always feeling tired and in pain.  I've cried over my old life a thousand of times.  Taking T is something that could very possibly make a lot of the negative symptoms go away.  However, I looked at my face in the mirror yesterday and I've done so much work to learn to love myself.  I don't think that I want my body to change and to become more male/distorted by the T.  Plus, it comes with side effects.  They likely aren't worse than how I feel at the moment.  Staying as I am let's me stay in a comfort zone but it resolves nothing. Becoming a woman will require a lot of work and I'm still not sure about my gender.  I don't want to make a mistake.  I had all of these years to think about it but I never did because I didn't think it would ever happen with my health so why bother?

I will have to make a choice either way!  I just don't know if taking women hormones would make the pain go away as well?

I don't know what you guys think of bio vs synthetic.  Bio doesn't have all that many studies but it does have proponents who swear by it and doctors who say that it's killing a patient early by giving them synthetically.  This is where I really need help.  If I go the way of T or the other route, would Bio give me the same effects?  I've accepted that I was going to die early due to my health a LONG time ago.  If I can live a few years happy, science will have given me everything that I ever wanted.  Science is my religion.  I did not pray all this time.  I became an atheist a long time ago.  My gods are all of you men and women and in-betweeners who make dreams come true with all of the sciences out there.  I did not think that I would have a chance in my lifetime and I wasn't mad at science.  It helps a lot of other people.  I just wasn't on the list of those who could be helped yet.  That was fine.  I didn't love it but I wasn't mad.  Now, I have a solution (maybe) and I'm left so confused.  I've been back since Friday and I've read about 100 articles on Bioidenticals and synthetics.  This is my life and I realize that I need to take charge.  Had I not taken charge and gone to this clinic last week, I would still be where I was.

Any help is so appreciated.  And yes, this is a throwaway. One of my friends has my ''real account'' and I'm not ready for everyone to know this.  I don't even have answers for myself so I'm not ready to answer other peoples questions!

490,If my Human Growth Hormone AND IGF-1 are low then why do I have to take a stimulation test?,"I guess I don't get it. I'm 20 years old and recently found out that I had a severe HGH deficiency. This was confirmed both by low IGF-1 and HGH levels. Now, instead of going on growth hormone, my endocrinologist is dead-set on getting *another* test called ""arginine stimulation"". Nobody in my area does it. I've, personally, been calling around trying to find a hospital that actually carries this test out and get rejected every time. Is this normal - like if I switched to another endo would they still make me do this? I feel and look absolutely awful and I just want to go on the medication."
491,Help with possible hormone imbalance?,"I am a 20 year old female and I started taking birth control pills my sophomore year in high school to help improve my acne. I was great at taking it every night around the same time, and taking 2 pills if I missed a night (even though it made me feel nauseous). Towards the end of my senior year in high school, I complained to one of my friends that I was going to have my period during prom, and my friend told me that I can skip the sugar pills for a month and go straight to the next pack, and ultimately this would just skip the period. 

This was the start of my inconsistency with the birth control pills. Since I wasn't on the pill to prevent myself from getting pregnant (aka, I was not sexually active), I started to really deviate from the prescribed method of taking the pills. I would sometimes prolong my period, or sometimes accidentally forget to take the pills, so my period would be two weeks apart. I would skip days without taking 2 pills the next day, because it made my stomach hurt. There was a period of time where I had 3 periods in 1.5 months. This irregularity continued for my whole freshman year of college; but I never thought of it as a problem because I wasn't in threat of becoming pregnant. 

During that first year of college, I gained about 27 pounds. I started at 135 in June of 2015 (end of senior year), and by February 2016 I was at 162. I attributed this to quitting dance (which had been my only exercise my whole life) and the inevitable slowing down of my metabolism. I started to exercise everyday and eat as clean as I could on a college campus (probably calorie restricted too much), but the weight was just taking so long to come off. I did manage to lose weight, about 7 pounds, but I was eating 2 meals a day and exercising excessively. 

When I was packing up my dorm room, my mom saw all my half empty birth control pill packets. She put two and two together and realized that my hormones were out of wack, and that’s why I’d been gaining all the weight. I researched hormone imbalances and everything started to make sense. I had extremely tender breasts that hurt every time I ran (even high support sports bras wouldn’t help), and I was gaining all this weight even when I was eating healthy and exercising enough. I finished the current month of birth control that I was on and decided to stop taking it completely. I figured that my hormones would go back to normal after 3-6 months of not being on the pill. I continued to eat clean and exercise regularly that summer and lost another 7 pounds. 

My dieting/exercise routine was not sustainable, so I ended up gaining back the 7 pounds that I let over the summer. Another thing is, my period was not going back to it’s normal cycle pre-birth control. There were months that it would be 15 days late, 35 days late, some months it was a normal range of 30ish days. In November of 2016, I decided to see a gynecologist. I told her my story, my symptoms, and mentioned that I think I could possibly have a hormone imbalance. She took a blood test. Here were the results:

Test taken on November 22nd
Last cycle start date at the time: September 15th

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) -  1.93 mcIU/mL
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) -  5.7 mIU/mL
Luteinizing Hormone -  11.7 mIU/mL
Estradiol - 37 pg/mL

My doctor said all of these test came back normal and she prescribed me with Provara to help kick start my period since it was so late. It worked, but did nothing regarding regulating my period. 

Side Note: When I say I have been eating healthy, I am referring to a diet consisting of mostly plant based foods, with very little meat (if anything, chicken), minimal grains, and no processed food. A typical day of eating for me would be a breakfast of sautéed zucchini, asparagus, sweet potato, spinach, little bit of quinoa and a poached egg. Lunch usually is some berries, an apple, broccoli/hummus. And dinner is a big salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. 

Since then, I have continued eating healthy - I did the Whole30 in January, yet didn’t lose any weight which was extremely surprising and disheartening. I trained for a half marathon, and still didn’t lose any weight (I am aware that it is common for marathon runners to gain weight while training, but I made sure my diet did not change as I was training). My weight has been crawling back up to it’s highest point. Last I checked, I was at 159. 

I truly believe that I am eating healthy and exercising enough that I should be losing weight - or at least maintaining my weight! My last period cycle started April 2nd and still has yet to start, so I am still battling with irregular menstrual cycles. I also have moderate acne, but I have been struggling with that since I became a teenager. 

Please let me know what step I should take next or if you had any similar experiences. "
492,"I'd like to talk to a professional well versed in sex hormone disorders about a crime. To be more specific, about the East Area Rapist","I can explain more but I really want to talk to some professionals before I make a tip to the cold case units investigating.  Long story short the EAR shows some aspects of someone with a thyroid condition.  Unusually small penis, slouch, strange walk, speech impediment.  I first thought about this when I learned this guy (very successful still-on-the-loose serial killer) had a small penis and never let his chest touch the victims.  I just had this instant where I thought ""Wonder if the guy had Klinefelters"", because the first reason I could think of for not letting victims see or touch your chest was gynecomastia.  Then I just kept hearing more and more that made sense within the context of a disorder involving sex hormones (after hearing he wasn't that tall I wondered if it was something other than Klinfelter's.  Even so, it could be that they caught it early in him and that he was undergoing treatment).  The guy knew that some drugs were kept in the fridge (and what meds were kept in the fridge in the 70s? Hormone therapies).  Dogs alerted to his smell at the crime scene by slobbering and shuddering, indicating that the offender had a serious disease or a drug addiction.  He was an ABO non secretor (not sure about Klinefelter's in particular but I know nonsecretor status is crosslinked with other illnesses/conditions.  He had a wonky metabolism and often had to stop in the middle of attacks to eat.  I'm guessing the slouch & lumbering walk was either a result of gynecomastia (trying to cover it up) or the result of musculoskeletal pain or both.  He definitely showed signs of alcoholism (there were always beer cans at the scene that he brought with him and emptied during attacks).  A lot of his acions indicate that he had OCD.  He's been described as having pronounced body odor, though in the very first attacks victims said that it wasn't exactly the same as the normal B.O. smell.  They said he had a unique though not necessarily ""bad"" smell about him.  But here's what puzzles me: He had thick hair on his legs and in the pubic region.  And the height thing- he was described as being somewhere between 5'8""-6'1"".  He was described as lean by people who saw him running through the night and victims said he was very agile.  Due to the dogs' reactions I am convinced he had some sort of condition, I just can't puzzle it out.  Could hormone replacement therapy explain away the average height and hair growth? Even if I'm way off base with this, what could the non-secretor status lead to? Any new types of info? I can't figure out which disorder's it's crosslinked to specifically.

editL there is so much out there on this guy yet he's never been caught.  If we could narrow the field down we could still catch him.  He's probably around 60ish now.  Evil guy.  I suggest you listen to the Casefile: Trie Crime episodes about him   **[Wiki page for the Original Night Stalker/EAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Night_Stalker)**

**[Voice recordings of the serial killer, left for his victims before and after](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/help-us-catch-the-east-area-rapistz)** along with witness testimony and evidence.  But as I said, I think the Casefiles podcast is doing a wonderful and thorough job.  I highly recommend it for true crime lovers and this case especially,"

494,Your Health and an Underactive Thyroid,"Hypothyroidism is a common medical disorder that affects millions of people. An underactive thyroid does not produce enough of the thyroid hormone. Your thyroid controls how your body uses energy. If you have an underactive thyroid, you might feel sluggish. The condition can also affect your heartbeat and body temperature. For most people, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is the cause of an underactive thyroid. It is an autoimmune disorder that attacks your thyroid. It causes your body to produce antibodies, and the antibodies can destroy your thyroid gland. Thyroiditis can cause inflammation and a viral infection. 

Causes of Hypothyroidism
Radiation therapy can also cause hypothyroidism. When radiation damages the cells, the thyroid gland has to work harder. Radioactive iodine treatment can destroy the thyroid gland. Surgery and medications can also cause an underactive thyroid. The human body does not produce iodine, and an iodine deficiency can cause hypothyroidism.

Side Effects of Hypothyroidism 
Hypothyroidism can cause cardiovascular problems, infertility and obesity. If a pregnant woman has an underactive thyroid, the disorder can affect the fetus. During the first trimester, the mother supplies the thyroid hormone. If the mother has an underactive thyroid, the disorder can affect the baby's mental development. If a person has an extremely underactive thyroid, the disorder can cause myxedema. Myxedema can cause a person to lose consciousness. 

Common Risk Factors 
Older women are more likely to be diagnosed with an underactive thyroid. The most common symptoms of an underactive thyroid are constipation, depression, fatigue and carpal tunnel syndrome. If you have any of these symptoms, you should make an appointment with a Tampa endocrinologist.

A synthetic thyroid hormone can treat hypothyroidism. Certain medications can interfere with the synthetic hormone, so you should speak with your endocrinologist about any medications you are currently taking.

495,Resource Request,"Hi Endo,

At some point in the past, I remember coming across a post from someone in this community who created a google document with a graph that showed typical biological levels throughout the day for just about any hormone or lab result imaginable.  For whatever reason, I failed to save it somewhere memorable and am most interested in adding it to my list of resources.  If you have the link to this resource (or a similar one), would you mind pointing me in the right direction, please?

Thank you in advance!   "

499,Out of my area of expertise in my nursing dissertation,"Hi all,

I don't usually frequent this sub and would say I have a more basic understanding of endocrinal anatomy and physiology than others here. Despite this, by writing my undergraduate dissertation on Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (AKA Borderline Personality Disorder) and its links to childhood trauma, I have been pushed to read and write on the topic much more than I ever intended to. The literature has directed my line of inquiry towards endocrinology and it now features prominently in my dissertation. I have learned a lot in the process!

However, whilst I'm getting praise from my acdemic supervisors for how the work relates to psychiatric nursing, I am not confident that the endo side is as solid. 

Is this a community in which I could put out my work for review? If that is frowned upon, then no probs. Just let me know. I'm really just looking for someone who knows their shit to tell me if I've made any glaring errors.

If people are open to this, I will be able to post work from tomorrow (I'm away from where the work is saved until then).

Thanks for your consideration!

500,Wondering what my next course of action should be.,"I could really use some advice.  I consider myself a reasonably well-informed patient but things are going badly and I'd like to know if my understanding of what's going on is accurate, and how I might proceed.  Everything below is true to the best of my understanding of what is going on.

At the start of last October, I read an article that led me to suspect that I've had low testosterone my entire life.  On top of symptoms, I have a varicocele, which can (but apparently does not always) cause bad T levels.  My doctor agreed to run some blood tests and found that I had a total T level of about 256 nG/dL.  After performing a few other tests for risk factors (all clear), we started treatment.

She put me on testosterone cypionate, 50 mg every other week.  I experienced some improvements but shortly slipped back into lethargy.  At my two month assessment my T levels were basically unchanged, so it was bumped up to 100 mg every other week.  Two months after that, the lab result came back at 450 nG/dL and I was told that it was good; they'd check back in a year.

Unfortunately, the next month was a descent into a vile malaise.  I requested another assessment and noted that both previous tests were taken six days after a dose - with injections every other Tuesday, the previous blood draws were the Monday after a dose rather than the day before; if anything, they were measuring me at closer to peak rather than at my lowest.

They tested me again this Monday, with a result back today of 112.5 nG/dL.  It feels like a little bit of vindication; I'd been afraid that something else was wrong, or perhaps it was all in my head.  

But my doctor is refusing to increase my prescription, saying that she can't (with no explanation).  Instead she wants me to start using transdermal patches - which my insurance will **not** cover and I can't afford.  So far as I can ascertain, 100 mg per two weeks is actually a very small dose.  [Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-lookup/doi/10.1210/jc.2009-2354) indicate to me that 75 mg *per* *week* is the lowest recommended treatment; I'm at 2/3 of that.  

I think it's possible she's mixed up the maximum dosage, and thinks that it's an upper limit of 200 mg per month, not 200 mg biweekly.  Should I write her to explain and request my dosage be increased, or just look for another doctor?  Or am I the one being unreasonable here?  My judgement might be compromised because I've spent most of the last three months feeling like utter crap."
501,Intracellular Receptor Confusion,"I'm currently TAing for an Endocrinology class. Our professor has always taught this section through Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Receptor categories. This is a bit confusing for me, as well as for the students. To the best of my knowledge, nuclear receptors include cytoplasmic receptors. In other words, Type I nuclear receptors reside in the cytoplasm, and Type II nuclear receptors reside in the nucleus. Moreover, the professor includes both thyroid hormones and estrogen in the nuclear (Type II) receptors. However, I believe estrogen receptors belong in the Type I nuclear receptors that reside in the cytoplasm (translocating into the nucleus in the presence of ligand tamoxifen). And only thyroid hormoes belong in the Type II nuclear receptors that reside in the nucleus. Could someone shed some light on the differentiation among intracellular hormone receptors? Thanks!"
502,HRT for Agender Person,"Hi, I'm 20 years old, identify as agender, and was assigned female at birth. I recently had my hormone levels measured for non-trans-related reasons. My estradiol is 337 pg/mL (the results say the standard range for my demographic is 13-498), testosterone is 44 (standard range 4-55), progesterone 1.4 (standard range 0.2-27), lutenizing hormone is 16.7 (standard range is 1.0-95.6), and follicle-stimulating hormone is 7.5 (standard range 1.7-21.5). Besides my chest, I'm pretty content with my body's primary and secondary sex characteristics, but I've been exploring the option of HRT to alleviate psychological dysphoria. I think my brain is wired rather masculinely, and I feel like it doesn't want as much female hormones as it's getting. I know that drastically low levels of both testosterone and estrogen cause osteoporosis and fatigue, but I wonder if I could take just a low dose of some kind of estrogen-blocker (like a SERM, an aromatase inhibitor, or a GnEH analogue) so that my estradiol level could be in the low range for females (male range is 8-43 pg/mL). My testosterone is on the higher side already for females (males my age have 240-950), so maybe it would balance out. I don't want my body masculinized; I just want the mental/emotional effects I've read about from FtMs on T. Is this possible? Thanks so much"
503,Understanding Thyroid Disorders,"The thyroid gland is small compared to many other organs, but it has a big role when it comes to keeping you active and healthy. A member of the endocrine system, the thyroid produces hormones that regulate the functioning of the body, and a malfunctioning of the organ can cause a number of ailments. An endocrinologist in Tampa is an expert at recognizing and treating thyroid disorders.

Understanding the Thyroid Gland
Shaped like a butterfly, the thyroid is located in your neck below the voice box. The gland produces hormones that, among other things, control breathing and heart rates, regulate cholesterol levels and exert control over weight and muscle development. The thyroid is itself activated by hormones produced elsewhere in your body, allowing it to produce its own hormones. 

Thyroid Gland Disorders
Nearly 30 million Americans are believed to experience thyroid disorders every year, although only about half of those affected are properly diagnosed. Hypothyroidism involves insufficient hormone production, which can lead to such health problems as excessive fatigue, depression and obesity. Excessive hormone production, known as hyperthyroidism, can result in such conditions as anxiety, mood disorders and even hair loss. A goiter is an enlargement of the gland itself, which can hamper breathing and swallowing. The thyroid can also be affected by nodules, which are often benign but can occasionally be cancerous.

Diagnosing and Treating Thyroid Disorders
A variety of methods are available in detecting thyroid abnormalities, but it will usually take a combination of two different tests to make an accurate diagnosis. Such diagnoses may involve laboratory tests, biopsies or the use of ultrasound equipment. Thyroid disorders are often treated with hormones, although diet and lifestyle changes may in some cases be sufficient. 

Seeking Help from a Tampa Endocrinologist
Using the latest technology, Tampa endocrinologists have the ability to diagnose thyroid conditions and recommend the best course of action for each case. The doctors will accomplish this while providing their patients with care that is both professional and personalized.

T4 11.8 (range 12-22),
TSH 1.78 (range 0.6-3.6),
Prolactin 1437 (range 50-400)

Always have been depressed (since childhood), but in the last year I no longer have ups and downs... just a lot of downs. At first, I really believed that I was just going into a state of panic over an incident with my skin (I have quite severe body dysmorphia and social anxiety which a whole other ordeal), and I NEVER came out of that panic. It has been a solid year, and all of the symptoms of a panic attack have amplified and followed me throughout each and every day.

Seemingly without trigger, I'll just snap and bitch at my fiance about stupid shit and hate myself and want to die, then slowly the fog will lift and I'm sitting there wondering what happened to my head.

It's gotten worse the last few months and I'm soon to make a gyno appt. to seek any advice they could possibly give. PMDD, maybe ovary cysts - I don't know what the cause is but I want to figure it out NOW. It could just be regular old PMS but it doesn't seem to make sense that it keeps getting worse.

Forgive me if this seems overly holistic, but does anyone have any experience with ashwagandha, holy basil or adaptogens in general?

I'm assuming it's a hormone imbalance because it has a monthly consistency to it, and want to find the most natural way to chill it out. If I had to guess; it might be an over sensitivity to progesterone, based on the Luteal phase timing, and the fact that for a couple years while I had a Mirena IUD I experienced (although waaay horrifyingly waaay more intense) similar mood swings. But this is just my own armchair endocrinology.

tl;dr My hormones are imbalanced af! Are you a woman with progesterone sensitivity or similar problems and has had experience with adaptogens? Do they work/what do you use?

Thanks in advance!

514,All About Endocrinology,"The glands in the human body are not very large, but they have a significant impact on your health. From the thyroid gland to the pancreas to the sex organs, proper glandular function is very important in keeping all of the body systems working correctly. With that in mind, here's some information about how an endocrinologist can help keep you healthy or treat problems like thyroid disease from Bay Area Endocrinology Associates in Tampa, Florida.

About the Endocrine System
The endocrine system includes all the glands of the body – the thyroid, parathyroid, pineal, hypothalamus, pancreas, ovaries, testes, adrenal and pituitary glands. Each of these has a specific function or group of functions and secretes one or more hormones directly into the bloodstream to regulate those functions. For example, the pancreas secretes insulin, which regulates the blood sugar. The thyroid secretes thyroid hormone, which regulates metabolism.

What's an Endocrinologist?
An endocrinologist is a physician who is trained initially in internal medicine. After completing medical school and residency, the next step is two to three years in an endocrinology fellowship. Endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism is a recognized sub-specialty of the American Board of Medical Specialties and most endocrinologists become board-certified after they complete fellowship training.

What Does an Endocrinologist Do?
Endocrinologists treat patients who have endocrine gland disorders such as too little hormone (like diabetes) or too much hormone (like hyperthyroidism). Other hormone-related conditions include menopause, osteoporosis, metabolic disorders, growth deficiency and cancers of the endocrine glands. Endocrinologists may also treat patients who have conditions related to endocrine function; people who have low thyroid, for example, are more likely to be overweight.

At Bay Area Endocrinology Associates, we specialize in disorders of the thyroid, related problems like obesity and other endocrine disorders. If you have such a problem, please contact us for an appointment. For more information make sure to check out our website at http://www.thyroiddoctortampa.com"
515,extremely low TSH and pregnancy,"We are trying to expand our family. We have a meeting scheduled with our endocrinologist in ~6 weeks, and would appreciate advice from this community so that we can ask the right questions.

Roughly a year after having our first child, my wife was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer (which spread to her lymph nodes). Thyroidectomy, radiation, now on Synthroid. It's been about a year, and she is doing very well now.

Based on how the thyroid cancer spread to my wife's lymph  nodes, the endocrinologist is working to keep my wife's TSH levels as close to 0 as possible. He said we should aim for keeping TSH levels extremely low for 5-to-10 years, in order to minimize the possibility of recurrence. We were given that timeframe roughly a year ago.

Our understanding is that pregnancy gets even more complicated when TSH levels are extremely low, and that the hormone fluctuations associated with pregnancy (primarily estrogen fluctuations) would be a significant challenge. That said, we would like to understand if there are ways we can try to pursue pregnancy in the near term... rather than waiting 4-to-9 years before trying.

Are there any specific questions we should ask our endocrinology (besides ""please help us find a way"")? Are there any techniques, procedures, or approaches that might help us find a way to protect my wife from recurrence, while also trying to carry another child?

Thank you for your help. We are not looking for a medical diagnosis over the internet; rather, we would sincerely appreciate any direction that you can point us in so that we're able to work this with our endocrinologist (and the reproductive endocrinologist in the same office, who will surely be brought into the conversation)."

519,Total test levels dropped 50% in one year despite eating healthier and drinking way less- any thoughts on my labs?,"Last year my total test levels were 459 and somehow the lab for free test wasn't ordered, this year the total test was 297 and the % free test index was 13.90%. This is very disappointing because I've been eating healthier, I went from drinking 5-7 drinks a night 2 days a week (10-14 drinks a weeks) to only drinking socially about one day every other week (around 1-2 drinks a week), I've had two girlfriends in the span of this year so I've had sex almost every day for months leading up to the test, so I thought my test levels would have gone up but they went down by over 50%. The tests were done around the same time, around 11-12 am, and the only bad thing which I did for test levels at all is I stopped lifting weights around two months ago because of a dental appliance which I'm wearing to expand my palate.    

My primary care dr said I could try hCG monotherapy if I wanted but she doesn't have any patients on it, she just read that it was good for some situations. I read about it and it sounds very promising, my fsh and lh levels were on the lower end of the limit and my estradiol was below the lower limit- 9 out of an 11-44 reference range.    

I want to see an endocrinologist and I probably will but it may be awhile so I was wondering if anyone here had any thoughts on my labs or my situation. Thanks"
520,Menstrual cycle triggered by intimacy?!,"Hi there! 
I have a concern about my menstrual cycle. I've been experiencing amenorrhea since 18 and had very irregular cycles before then. Menarche was at 16 and I would go months without bleeding but when I did bleed, it was heavy and lasted over a week, sometimes up to 2 weeks. 
Anyway, I haven't had a period in years as I'm 20 now. I never found the reason why I had such irregular cycles or why my menstrual cycle just seemed to freeze in time. What's interesting however, is that a few days ago, I spent the night with a male friend. I've never been intimate with men before and this was my first time. We didn't have intercourse or anything even close to that-- we only lay beside together and kissed. Would you believe that I found light blood spotting today? After 3 YEARS, could being with a guy cause my body to think ""goodness, she's ready to populate!""? 
I'm not so much confused as I'm FASCINATED by the human body. Would any of you in endocrinology/pheromonology like to provide some insight?

521,Could I have Conn's Syndrome?,"I have posted this on r/AskDocs as well, but I thought I might ask in a more specific subreddit as well. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

It started about six months ago when I noticed that my heart was feeling strange and I was having bouts of flushed skin and headaches. I decided to have this checked out, so I went to a clinic and had my pulse/ BP tested and I got back a reading of 155/70 at 55 beats per minute. I had it tested a few subsequent times to confirm with similarly high readings.


I went to see a nurse practitioner who ran an EKG, some blood tests, and gave me a holter monitor to further examine my heart for arrythmias, but they revealed nothing out of the ordinary besides a couple brief arrhythmias and my HR briefly dropped to 37bpm while I was sleeping. I was prescribed 10mg of Lisinopril which initially seemed to lower my BP, with the average still around 137/65, but still with occasional readings of up to 149/70.
I scheduled a followup visit with a cardiologist a couple weeks ago because the medication wasn't controlling my BP to my liking and he scratched his head a bit saying ""If you were fat or smoked I'd tell you to quit/ eat better, but you're neither so I guess we'll just double your dose of Lisinopril and see how that does"".


I've been taking the 20mg of Lisinopril now for two weeks with no change whatsoever, I still regularly get readings of 150/65 and have bouts of lightheadedness and slight nausea. I will also have perfectly normal readings at times, too. Alongside these symptoms, I've been having strange pulsing/twitching sensations in my lower left leg that seem to be assuaged by rubbing it. At this point I know I haven't run the gamut of available BP medications, but I decided do some research on medication resistant high blood pressure and ran across an article describing a renal disease called Primary Hyperaldosteronism or Conn's Syndrome that seems to match my symptoms fairly closely (especially the muted response to medication).


My question is: Could they miss Hyperaldosteronism on a cursory blood panel? Do my symptoms seem congruous with Conn's Disease?

I would like to ask a question about my diet. I'm 17 years old type 1 diabetic (My weight is 168lbs and height is 6.1 feet). I plan to start to workout and build some muscle. I've searched for information on the internet, what should I eat and i made myself a meal plan. But now I doubt that this meal plan is good for me.  
Eating by this meal plan my macronutrients would be like this: 3035 Calories | 83g Fat | 400g Carbohydrates | 172.5g Protein.

Anyway, I still couldn't find the right answer to this question. Also I'm planning do reduce my carbohydrate intake (and also calorie intake a bit). So what I want to ask you is how much protein can I consume, how many grams would be too many for me? Is there a difference in consuming protein when you have diabetes?

529,Can someone help me with my hormone test results? [Pics included],"Hi,

Recently I ordered a private test company to measure my hormone results. I've noticed that, despite my low bmi, I have moderate gynecomastia. I also lack many secondary sexual characteristics (low voice, facial hair, ability to gain muscle) and still have fat deposits around my hips. I thought maybe this had something to do with low testosterone but my results seem to indicate very *high* testosterone and moderately high estrogen levels (high aromatose?) ... Would I look foolish taking these results to a doctor? Below I'll post pics of the test itself.

531,I can't have this many things wrong with me.,"*Sorry in advance for the ramble.  I don't know where else to go and would love either some perspective, handpats, or miracle diagnosis.*  




I just got back from my endo and am feeling overwhelmed.  I'm only 32 and I have just added two more diagnoses to my never-ending list:

* Anxiety
* Depression
* PCOS
* Hypo-thyroid
* Possible pituitary tumor (results came back ""suspicious"" today)

I am on so many medications.  I am on:
Zoloft (100mg)
Wellbutrin (300 mg)
Lamictal (300 mg)
Synthroid (75 mcg )
Metformin (2000 mg)

Day to day, I am fine.  The addition of Synthroid has helped tremendously: I am no longer gaining weight, I don't sleep 12 hours a day anymore, I feel like a person.  But I haven't had a period in about a year and a half, I'm still overweight, and my anxiety and depression (without medication) is intense.  I've had no cysts, the PCOS diagnosis is based on insulin resistance (not an official diagnosis, but my numbers are high) and my lack of period.

Is there any possibility that some of these things might be related?  Like, maybe everything is symptoms that fall under one big umbrella?  God, if I could just get diagnosed with ONE thing that addressed all of these it would be amazing.  

EDIT:  Synthroid 75 mcg , not 40mg."
532,"Cold extremities, fatigue, thinning hair, dry/flaky forehead skin, depression, brain fog, no libido, arms getting thin, normal TSH and T4 levels. What else can I test? Should I see an endocrinologist?","I am 21 years old. I have been struggling with horrible fatigue for many years now. I feel tired every day no matter how many hours I sleep. I have terrible brain fog and can't concentrate. I'm very sensitive to sunlight as it makes me feel very tired, to the point that I absolutely cannot function without shutting the blinds. I feel constant apathy and no libido. Ever since I was put on an SSRI my hair has thinned and my emotions have flatlined and this hasn't changed after a year of discontinuing treatment. Things are getting worse. I've even had tests done because of some serious heart palpitations that worried me but I'm told it's nothing to worry about.  I've had an MRI and many blood tests done but my doctors tell me my levels are normal and won't help me further. 

Here are my levels:

S-TSH 0.67 uIU/ml 0.27 - 4.20

S-FT4 19.6 pmol/L 10.16 - 22.0

I read [here](http://hypothyroidmom.com/top-5-reasons-doctors-fail-to-diagnose-hypothyroidism/) however that just testing TSH and T4 isn't enough because it assumes that proper conversion is taking place. Is this true? Should free and reverse T3 be tested as well? 

I've also had a full blood count and cholesterol test done, all normal. What else can I do? I can't stand living like this, I need help.

Edit: I don't smoke and I've tested all my vitamin B levels and they're normal.

535,31F with a microadenoma on the pituitary.. experiencing hives multiple times daily and other symptoms,"I have had multiple MRIs that show a adenoma on the left floor of my pituitary gland between 3 & 4 mm in size.  For the last five months I have been experiencing hives multiple times a day on a daily basis with the worst of them always being around 10pm.  I use all hypoallergenic cleaning supplies and personal items.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/GfGhI) are some of the images I have taken of my hives over the last month.  Please note that the cuts on my arm are from my lovely cat.  The ones on my upper thigh are from self harm from ages and ages back (like 15 years ago or more.  Please do not be alarmed I am no longer cutting.)

I also have issues with low blood pressure, maintaining a regular sleep cycle, extreme intolerance to heat and intense anxiety issues.  After an anxiety attack I get terrible headaches that die off after having a smoothie... which make me wonder about my blood sugar.

I requested that my primary care physician refer me to an endocrinologists so that I can get an am pm cortisol check.  I am worried that I may have Addison's/Psuedo Addison's.  My doctor denied my request.  

Do you think that it is likely that my pituitary adenoma is related to these hives?  Is it possible I have Addison's?  I would like to get to the bottom of this mess and figure out what is causing all of this but my General Practitioner does not have the ability to run these tests.  What's more is that I have been taking benadryl to control my hives on a daily basis (up to four a day) but they are no longer working.  It would be nice to get a prescription of a stronger antihistamine so that I can either prevent or medicate my hives.

539,Need to make a decision about toxic nodular goiter treatment,"Background: 
- December 2015 Dx as borderline hyperthyroid (TSH: <0.1, T3: 187ng/dL, T4 and FT4 in the normal range)
- January 2016, TSI index normal ruling out Graves'
- May 2016 ultrasound identified a 2.5cm nodule with an incidental finding of complete left lobe agenesis.  These findings were confirmed by an I123 scan.  FNA revealed normal thyroid tissue.

Outside of a slightly elevated pulse (~75-80 resting versus lower 60s) I have no other symptoms.

Endo is giving me the choice between medication, RAI or thyroidectomy.  He sees medication as a temporary solution, with ablation or surgery an eventuality.  I'd rather get it over with, and am considering the latter two options.  I'm 40, in excellent health, work full time, enjoy a regular exercise routine, and have two small children.  I've done due diligence on the surgeon I'd have, should I choose that option, and she is both seasoned and highly recommended.  As my endocrinologist explains it, I'm young and healthy enough to tolerate either option, though isolation from my children may be a challenge.  And, as I understand it, either way I am looking at levothyroxine treatment.  I've read that levothyroxine dosing can sometimes be easier in individuals with no functioning thyroid rather than those with some functioning thyroid remaining, is this true?  My gut reaction is to go with surgery though I'd like a sanity check to ensure I'm making a data-driven decision rather than an emotional one.  I'm a cancer researcher and am constantly thinking about the dangers of dividing cells, or picking up that second or third mutation that can cause a malignancy -- I think that we as a group tend to be of the ""if it's growing and it shouldn't be, cut it out"" mentality without appreciating all of the other clinical positives and negatives that go along with such decisions. It's also not clear to me whether a complete ablation is recommended or simply trying to eradicate some of the tissue (is there any truth to it being easier to manage synthetic hormone levels in the absence of any working thyroid tissue?).  I also read that RAI carries a minuscule risk of a secondary cancer developing much later down the line.  It means something to my psychologically to not have that lurking even in my deepest subconscious.  Practically, I don't really care about a scar, and actually a week alone in a cabin in the woods sounds rather nice.

Any endocrinologists with thoughts on one choice or another?  Mine didn't blink when I said ""surgery"" (he would have supported any decision), but now I'm wondering if I should be more thoughtful about my decision.

540,Need Advice - Testosterone and Clomiphene,"I originally went to the urologist for sexual difficulties, but he found that I have very low (163 ng/dL), so I've been taking 25 mg of Clomid for about 3 months as prescribed by the urologist.

The only downsides are I have developed more acne and hair.

541,"Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Armour/NDT, and pregnancy questions","Hi all. I have some questions about my wife's condition.

She was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis at 23 (I think) and has been on levothyroxine (Synthroid I believe) ever since. Her condition was discovered when she got checked up back then for rapid weight gain and general lethargy. She's 32 now and has always struggled with the extra weight since back then, but this isn't really about that.

We've been trying to get pregnant for about two years now and have had no luck. We've basically tried everything except IVF at this point, and before we spend a lot of time and money on that (or adoption, which can end up being just as expensive), we wanted to look into getting her body straightened out and hopefully being able to get pregnant naturally.

So her cycle's been messed up ever since she was diagnosed. It's just now approaching some semblance of regularity, but even still it fluctuates quite a bit from month to month. She has never done too much research into her thyroid condition on her own and has just trusted her doctors about it.

She's asked a couple doctors about switching to NDT/Armour/pig thyroid stuff over the years because she has a couple friends who made the switch to it from levo and showed improvements all around (weight, general well-being, menstrual issues, etc.). Every doctor she's asked about switching has strongly discouraged it, and she didn't pursue it beyond that.

So with our pregnancy problems, I've been helping her do more research. Her thyroid levels seem to fluctuate a lot, and the weight loss (she's been working hard to lose weight this year and has lost 20 pounds already) seems to be affecting her levels as well, so she's been going in to her endocrinologist a bit more frequently.

On her last visit, she mentioned switching to Armour to the nurse practitioner (she very rarely sees the actual doctor), and apparently this woman looked her straight in the eye and told her that ""it's impossible for the placenta to absorb the pig hormone"" and that switching off of levo while we're trying to get pregnant would be a bad idea.

We did some research that night, though, and were unable to find a single source to back up the NP's claim. Not only that, we found several instances--posts on message boards dedicated to thyroid stuff, personal accounts--of women who were only able to conceive after switching to NDT/Armour and were totally fine throughout the pregnancy (with regular checkups to measure their thyroid levels of course).

So I guess I have two questions:

1) Is there any grain of truth at all to the NP's claim that the placenta would be unable to absorb NDT? I'm hesitant to call this woman a liar, but I could not find anything to back her claim up online and in fact found evidence of the opposite (anectodal evidence, but still).

2) What can my wife do to get her doctor to switch her to NDT/Armour? Her current doctor is one of the ones who has talked her out of it in the past. We're looking for a new endocrinologist in Austin because she doesn't really like her current one (and this thing with the NP has certainly not helped), but it seems like she's had a lot of pushback from several doctors about getting off levothyroxine, and all with very general ""not as accurate, etc"" reasoning. Her cycle has been wildly irregular from the beginning on levothyroxine, her body temperature is always weirdly low (like 95-96 degrees), and the whole weight and fertility thing...she really just wants to finally try something different to see if it helps, but she hasn't had a single doctor yet who allowed her to switch.

547,Hypothyroidism and TSH levels? (short),"Hello endocrinology people!

Short story

I have been on thyroid replacement therapy, i think it's called, 1.6 ug/kg approx, for over 10 yrs, after initial diagnosis of hypothyroidism.  My new primary care doctor had a TSH test done, saw it was low (0.2 is definitely low) and decided I should reduce my dosage.  Does that seem right to you?  I'm not sure if it seems right to me.  Are TSH levels supposed to be normal when I'm taking a full replacement dosage?

Based on my layman's understanding, it seems like it should be a test of T4 and maybe T3 levels.

More parts of story that may be relevant:

My body mass is about 175lb and when I calculate at 1.6 ug/kg it should be right about at 125 ug (micrograms). I have been taking 150 ug for years.  I don't usually take it quite right (too soon before breakfast).

Have never been to an endocrinologist for it (insurance is not very good now).

I tried to read this paper, https://www.aace.com/files/final-file-hypo-guidelines.pdf  but I have not gotten all the way through it.  There seem to be two diagnoses:
""subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to 
establish a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, whether primary, 
in which serum TSH is elevated, or central, in which serum 
TSH is normal or low (46,47).""  So maybe it depends which of these I am having.

Anyway probably the right answer would be to get my medical records from the physician I had before to figure out what is going on a little better, to avoid confusing the new physician.

Also, I have been having a sore on the side of my neck, which I thought was a tumor, but I guess it's not (blood tests look normal).  I does sort of feel better today (more energetic) after I skipped my thyroid pill yesterday per instructions. (Also flonase, i'm allergic, it seems to help my throat feel better).

It's all very fascinating!

Thank you for any info, insights, corrections, spiritual guidance etc :)

549,"Need labs interpreted, ongoing hypoglycemia without diabetes/insulin","this is a crosspost from /r/askdocs

I'm a dietitian at a hospital. I need some help! I have a patient who just had a PEG tube placed and is on tube feedings but keeps having hypoglycemia. She is also refeeding, and her phos was <1 today. She is on D5 for the hypoglycemia, but I am somewhat concerned that might be making the problem worse as there is no etiology for the hypoglycemia. The D5 is definitely not helping her electrolytes at this point. I looked back through past admissions and this is an ongoing issue, continuously low blood sugar of no noted etiology. I want to get to the root of this problem, but obviously I'm not a doctor. Here's some info that might help:


73 year old female, BMI 17.5


Labs: 2/13/16 insulin level 1.6, c-peptide 1.7

12/24/15 free T4 0.9, TSH 10.72

9/14/14 cortisol 17.1

her blood sugar has gone as low as 34 during this admission. It has been 69-131 the past 2 days, on tube feeding and D5. The tube feeding is running continuously.


Past medical history: HTN, arthritis, GERD, hypothyroidism, nonstemi, cardiomyopathy with EF 35-40% s/p stenting, esophageal stricture s/p dilations, iron deficiency anemia, odynophagia, dysphagia

I also noted from past admissions over the last year or two that she has ongoing hyponatremia, usually mild, but her sodium has gone as low as 115. hypoalbuminemia ongoing as well, her albumin was 1.6 on admission. her labs have gotten better with lasix. BNP and troponins are also elevated sometimes, from prior admissions.


Thanks, let me know if you need anything else! We don't have an endocrinologist at this hospital on an inpatient basis so I don't really have anyone to go to about this specifically, but if I have a better idea what's going on I can go to her hospitalist about it."

551,The Human Endocrine Pancreas: New Insights on Replacement and Regeneration,
552,Sexual Dysfunction. Endocrinology related? [Lab Profile],"Hi, without going into too much harrowing detail, I have dealt with crippling sexual side effects after taking two OTC lifting supplements: USP Labs Anabolic Pump, USP Labs Prime, and following that taking a hair loss product (Propecia). Both lifting supplements are advertised as nonhormonal and can be bought at GNC. I was wondering if anyone could look at some of my lab results and see if anything is off to you. I'm going off the logic of take drug -> side effects -> try to figure out what happened. I would greatly appreciate if someone could look at my results along with my symptoms and make any correlations if they see any.

Side effects: Low libido (I can watch porn with entire indifference), ED (didn't get morning wood for years, back somewhat now), shrinkage, premature ejaculation, can only maintain erection with manual stimulation, cold feeling penis, penis tilts to the right (I know this may seem trivial, but my flaccid penis was usually in the middle or however it was in my underwear. Now, ALWAYS tilted right), lower pelvic pain, frequent urination, severe depression/anxiety (following sexual side effects), brain fog (could be from depression). All began at age 19.

These are the labs I had done at age 23.

AM Cortisol: 17 mcg/dL Range: 7-25

Androstenedione, S: 106ng/dL Range: 40-150

DHT (S): 381 pg/mL Range: 112-955

Estradiol,S: 25 pg/mL Range: 10-40

FSH(S): 2.3 IU/L Range: 1.0-18.0

IgA(S): 125 mg/dL Range: 61-356

IgA,Tissue Transglutaminase Ab, S: <1.2 U/mL Range: <.4 (negative)

LH(S): 5.3 IU/L Range: 1.8-8.6

*Prolactin(S): 15.4 ng/mL Range: 4-15.2

SHBG: 35 nmol/L Range: 10-57

Testosterone, Bioavailable: 142 ng/dL Range: 83-257

Testosterone, Free, S: 13 ng/dL Range: 9-30

Testosterone,Total,S: 489 ng/dL Range: 240-950

T4: 7.6 mcg/dL Range: 4.5-11.7

I am trying to see if I need to pursue more endocrinological tests/doctors, modes of treatment in that area, or look elsewhere. 

At the age of 19, the following I list were the entirety of the drugs I was taking when these side effects occurred. I was fine until I added USP Labs Prime and USP Labs Anabolic Pump. After adding these supplements my problems began.

OTC Lifting supplements: Ultima Preworkout (lifting supplement for focus in the gym), Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass (bunch of calories/protein/carbs to gain weight). USP Labs Anabolic Pump, USP Labs Prime were added and within one week I developed these symptoms. These two supplements seemed like the trigger to these horrific side effects. 

Other prescribed drugs at the time: Alprazolam, Ambien CR (both for sleep)

Other: Rogaine

**Edit**: If you would like links to these supplements let me know. The ingredient list is sparse on USP Labs products. It is mostly proprietary blend. 

**Edit 2**: I was also able to procure a few more lab results done two years prior to the results I just listed. Age 20-21 at the time. They are as follows: 

TSH: 1.9 miU/L, Range: 0.3-5.0 

DHT 434 pg/mL, Range: 112- 955 

Prolactin 5 ng/mL, Range: 3-13

554,Why do you have hirsutism in secondary ovarian insufficiency?,
555,Should I take Iodine supplements?,"I've experienced what I now consider to be some serious health problems over the last few years. Increasingly, I've had pain everywhere in my body at night, recently developed asthma, extremely sore muscles, sensitivity to cold. Endless mucus build up in my throat. I'd lost my singing voice. Very weak muscles that wouldn't develop despite mild training at the gym.  I could go on, I'm 42 and thought well I guess I'm just getting old. 

Now I'm not one to run the to doctor, for the simple reason that they can't help me if I can't help myself. So my position has always been to investigate thoroughly. 

I've also had some bad habits, up until a few months ago I smoked weed each and every day, cigarettes (quit 3 years ago), excessive alcohol , way too much coffee, sometimes up to 4L of diet coke a day, didn't see any harm in fake sugar either. So ya, lots of bad stuff there  I know. 

Add to this weight problems, sleeping problems, mood problems. It's been an exhausting last few years. 

But it was the headaches that drove me to change. I mean I don't even drink alcohol and I was waking up in the morning with splitting headaches worse than if I had downed 24 oz of Vodka. Not fun. 

So I set out on a mission to quit everything about 3 months months ago. First was the weed. Gone. Next was the coffee. Gone. Next was all the bad food, etc....until I gave up everything but herbal tea (without sugar) and water. I am now 100% bad habit free (I have a lot of will power when needed:-)

To no avail. I still had the headaches. I thought it might be the water so I bought a great water filter and only drank from it for a week. No change. Until one day I tried to cut out my table salt. BINGO.

This was about 3 days ago, but I'm very sensitive to change and could feel an immediate lifting of pressure on my body. Suffice to say that all the problems I listed, even my bad moods, have gone away within a matter of days. Now when I say gone away I mean like vanished. Gone. I can't even believe it. 48h later I felt like a million bucks. Last night I went to bed at 11, feel asleep with no sleeping pills, slept all night and felt wonderfully rested this morning. Halleluja. This morning I woke up and banged out 45 push ups and could clearly feel a change in the way my body was distributing energy. All I can say is wow!

So I've been reading about Salt, Iodine, Iodide and its relationship with my Thyroid trying to figure out what's going on and where to take it from here. 

I've taken table salt out of my diet (flushed it down the toilet) although I realize there is still a lot in the cheeses and processed meats and stuff. I bought organic natural salt

http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00N75R7WY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00

and used just a pinch this morning, but I'm hesitant to use any at all as I just need a pause from all the headaches. 

I'm thinking of having some tests done either by my doctor or on the net. So here are my questions

Should I take a test despite feeling great now, if so what test should I ask my doctor to give me. If I get one online, what tests could help me here. 
Should I take iodine supplements? 
What damage may I have done and is there any way to repair it?

I've read some of the literature on this and it appears muddled. On the one hand you're told to have only 150 micrograms of iodine daily, on the other hand the Japanese take up to 8 mg daily and have less related cancers. I won't' list the contradiction I've read, suffice to say it appears to be a controversial topic which leaves me a bit baffled. 

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Many thank yous:-)"

559,Bizarre Hair Issue,"
******TL;DR I have endometriosis and IBS (and am often bloated a lot of the time because of my IBS). The issue I'm asking about is that I have had waxy buildup (looks like product buildup) in my hair for years now at varying intensities (although no scalp issues), have tried literally everything to get rid of it from a professional Culligan water softener ion exchange, checking chlorine levels in my current area, to every imaginable shampoo and conditioner and scrubbing technique and am thinking this is related to one of my aforementioned health problems. What are your thoughts and what type of doctor should I see (if applicable)?*******








So this problem is one I've had probably for 7 years at varying intensities. I hope this is a suitable forum for it; if not, would greatly appreciate if you could direct me somewhere else 

To preface my question/explanation, I need to say that I have endometriosis. I keep it under control with birth control, although I haven't always been the best at remembering. I also have pretty bad IBS which may be related.

So, my hair always has a waxy residue on it. I never blowdry or put extra products in my hair besides shampoo or conditioner. I have tried every product under the sun to try to get rid of this build-up; from clarifying shampoos to washing just with conditioner to every routine imaginable. I have bought a water softener from Culligan to see if it would help even though my water was only very slightly hard. I have checked the chlorine levels in my area and specifically in my house, which are normal. I have spent thousands of dollars on products and this water softener. 

My hair was a little better when I was at school a few years ago although dry but I still had somewhat of this problem. I've washed my hair at my aunt's house across town multiple times (so it isn't a problem with my house's individual pipes) and when I got a good scrubbing and haircut in the city, hours away from my house, I still had some residue right away (after he spent a huge amount of time getting it out of my hair). I have never come across anyone in my town with this problem. I always make sure to scrub my hair (and have tried it at various frequencies over time). My sister has lived with me and has never had a problem with her hair at this location. My hair stylist sees people from everywhere around the state and he's never seen someone with my issue.

It is important to note that I don't have any issues with my scalp: no redness or flaking. I know this can sometimes be the culprit.

I don't know what to do. Because I've tried to address this problem in every practical way (literally every way and I have done so much research on product residue). I feel that it might be related to one of my aforementioned health issues. I don't even know what doctor to see about this: gastroenterologist? dermatologist? endocrinologist?

***Note: I have posted this in all the hair forums on reddit multiple times, so please don't direct me there. Nothing helpful came of any of those postings, just the same ol' advice with products to try, unfortunately****

I have come across a few other people online who have experienced this as a persistent problem and some believe that it has to do with hormones or something. Is this a crazy thought? I am desperate at this point because my hair always makes it look like I don't shower and it's humiliating. I'll wash my hair with clarifying shampoo and deep condition and it will look good for a few hours and then revert to waxiness/residue again (I'll try with other shampoos and other conditioners too; varying routines).

So I guess.... what are your initial thoughts about this and suggestions on what kind of doctor I should see (if applicable)?

Do other peptide hormones stay viable for a period after death? Also, if growth hormone is synthesized in response to GHRF by the hypothalamus, wouldn't there be a good chance that at the time of death, only a day's worth of GH would be synthesized and available from extraction from the pituitary of a cadaver?"

The pituitary gland was not adjacent to the tumor and is still there.  Recently, I have started making cortisol, (Did an ACTH tes to confirm) and my endo says I don't need presnisone anymore.  How could this randomly happen?  Are there ways to promote recovery of additional functionality?  My endo says it is spontaneous."

566,Endocrinological causes of Postpartum Depression,"My wife has suffered postpartum depression for several months since the birth of our first child, and the standard approach where we live--outside the US--is for psychiatrists to prescribe antidepressants, in particular Zoloft (OTC name sertraline), which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). 

Firstly, the Zoloft was prescribed with minimal blood work and no hormonal studies whatsover.  This lack of an investigative approach concerns me.

Secondly, what would be the appropriate hormonal studies to request of an endocrinologist in this case?  (I assume that they should address levels of monoamine oxidase, serotonin, and dopamine and/or their various precursors, including tryptophan, 5-HTP, GABA, and L-tyrosine.)

Thirdly, my understanding is that taking serotonin and dopamine precursors as supplements has little downside because excess amounts are excreted with no side effects if they are synthesized.  

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

I have an endocrinology final year exam on monday, I'm not struggling or anything like that but does anyone have interesting facts that I can slip in on these two things?? Just something 'cool' or new or related to disease. 

Cheers! "
568,Hello All!,"I'm completely new to endocrinology. I'm currently studying to be a neuropharmacologist, and I recently got diagnosed with a hormonal imbalance (low cortisol and low testosterone) that has lead to heretofore unexplained issues in me (digestion, mood, energy, and attention deficit) for at least 7 years, if not far prior, even 16 years ago, perhaps.

So, I've decided I need to learn my shit about endocrinology so that I can figure out how to best fix myself. I have ADHD, so I cant' make promises, but I'll try to post good articles and research that I find concerning endocriniology. Best to all and I think, considering how important peptides and hormones are becoming, I think this subreddit will become quite successful!"
